      <title>The West's left-right battle lines run through Brazil...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/The-West-s-left-right-battle-lines-run-through-14825130.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"They did not jail a man," declared the released prisoner. "They tried to kill an idea, and ideas don't disappear."  The freed man was Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former left-wing Brazilian president who was jailed last year on corruption charges that his supporters believe were politically motivated. Lula left office in 2010 with a staggering 80 percent approval rating and was favored to be on course to return to power in 2018; his imprisonment paved the path to the presidency for far-right firebrand Jair Bolsonaro, who, both on the campaign trail and now in office, has loudly banged the drum against perceived perfidy and tyranny of leftist dogma.  But last week, Brazil's Supreme Court ruled that Lula, as well dozens of others ensnared in a rolling corruption probe that reshaped Brazilian politics, had been unjustly jailed without receiving due process - that is, they had been denied the ability to exhaust their right to appeal their sentences before imprisonment. On Friday, Lula walked out of jail and was greeted by a throng of supporters from his left-leaning Workers' Party.  "You have no idea of the meaning of me being here with you," he said soon after his release in the southern city of Curitiba. "I, who have been speaking to the Brazilian people through all my life, did not think that I would be able to speak today . . . Every day you were the democracy's fuel I needed to exist."  From thousands of miles to the north came a striking message of support. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted his admiration for Lula's socially minded policies and decried his imprisonment. "I am delighted that he has been released from jail, something that never should have happened in the first place," Sanders said. Lula thanked the U.S. candidate for his "solidarity," and expressed his "hope"...</description>

      <title>BOOK:  AIDES TRIED TO 'SAVE COUNTRY' FROM TRUMP</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Nikki-Haley-claims-top-aides-tried-to-recruit-her-14824057.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two of President Donald Trump's senior advisers undermined and ignored him in what they claimed was an effort to "save the country," former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley claims in a new memoir.  Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly sought to recruit her to work around and subvert Trump, but she refused, Haley writes in a new book, "With All Due Respect," which also describes Tillerson as "exhausting" and imperious and Kelly as suspicious of her access to Trump.  "Kelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren't being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country," Haley wrote.  "It was their decisions, not the president's, that were in the best interests of America, they said. The president didn't know what he was doing," Haley wrote of the views the two men held.  Tillerson also told her that people would die if Trump was unchecked, Haley wrote.  Tillerson did not respond to a request for comment. Kelly declined to comment in detail, but said that if providing the president "with the best and most open, legal and ethical staffing advice from across the (government) so he could make an informed decision is 'working against Trump,' then guilty as charged."  In the book, which was obtained by The Washington Post ahead of its release Tuesday, Haley offers only glancing critiques of her former boss, saying she and others who worked for Trump had an obligation to carry out his wishes since he was the one elected by voters.  The former South Carolina governor, widely viewed by Republicans as a top potential presidential candidate, has repeatedly sought to minimize differences with Trump while distancing herself from his excesses. Haley, 47, writes that she backed...</description>
