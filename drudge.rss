      <title>Many see Trump as the real cause of his campaign's woes...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Many-see-Trump-as-the-real-cause-of-his-15414364.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A sudden shake-up of President Donald Trump's campaign was an attempt to refocus a reelection effort cratering under the weight of a deadly pandemic, a stalled economy and a national reckoning on racial injustice.  But numerous Republicans and Trump allies said Thursday that the personnel overhaul - demoting Brad Parscale and replacing him with Bill Stepien as campaign manager - does little to address the main problem facing the struggling Trump campaign: the president himself and his chronically self-destructive behavior.  In Trump's orbit and Republican circles, there is growing unease and even panic over Trump's conduct as allies fret that the president, who lags behind presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden in both public and private polling, is free-falling into a political abyss.  Republicans have long accustomed themselves to the mayhem that seems to accompany Trump everywhere, like a personal tornado cloud. They are not deserting him, and they acknowledge that supporting the president means at least tacitly condoning his more incendiary comments and actions.  But even stalwarts are bewildered by what many view as his self-sabotaging actions, worried not only that he may lose in November but also that he will drag the rest of the party down with him.  "The whole world has changed in the past six months, and I don't know if the president has caught up," said Amy Koch, a Republican and former majority leader of the Minnesota Senate. "His messaging is landing on deaf ears. He just doesn't seem to fully understand what people are talking about or worrying about."  The Trump administration so far has no clear national plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 134,000 in the United States. The president has continued to defend the Confederate flag - a symbol of slavery and racism...</description>

      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Cybersecurity-202-Twitter-breach-is-another-15413196.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time, the massive Twitter hack Wednesday was seemingly just a petty scam to raise bitcoin - at least based on what's known so far. But next time, it could be far more serious.  The unknown hackers held the Twittersphere in thrall as they seized control of high-profile accounts and sent phony tweets from Joe Biden, Barack Obama and a who's who of top companies and business and entertainment leaders. It took Twitter hours of work and an unprecedented shutdown of all verified accounts to halt the operation.  U.S. adversaries that gained that sort of power could sow mass chaos on Election Day by tweeting out phony information about voter fraud or polling locations shut down by the coronavirus or terrorist attacks. And because the breach targeted Twitter controls, over which campaigns are powerless, they might have no power to stop the stream of phony tweets from flowing.  If Twitter once again shut down verified accounts' ability to tweet while it investigated a breach, that would also cut off a key avenue for campaigns, government officials and law enforcement to correct misinformation.  Such an attack could be particularly disastrous during a close election if people don't vote because of the confusion.  "Russia's most dangerous play is how do you inflict the maximum amount of chaos on Election Day," Clint Watts, a distinguished research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute who tracks Russian influence operations, told me. "They want to further erode confidence in democracy, and this is emblematic of a way they can do that."  Rachel Tobac, chief executive of SocialProof Security, called the breach very concerning. "We are extremely lucky that these attackers are monetarily motivated and not sowing mass chaos all over the world," she said.  Other prominent...</description>

      <title>'HOPELESS': Republican Gov. rips Trump's virus response in scathing letter...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/925865/marylands-gop-governor-publishes-scathing-indictment-trumps-coronavirus-response</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can apparently count Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) among the solid majority of Americans who are unimpressed with President Trump's COVID-19 response. In a brutal Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, for example, 62 percent of registered voters said Trump is hurting the effort to fight COVID-19, while 67 percent said they don't trust the information he shares about the disease. Unlike most Americans, though, Hogan has a front-row seat to Trump's response, both as a governor and chairman of the National Governors Association. Hogan published a detailed, withering critique of Trump's response in an op-ed Thursday in Trump's least-favorite newspaper, The Washington Post. He started with the extraordinary effort he and his Korean-born wife, Yumi Hogan, made to fly 500,000 COVID-19 tests in from South Korea in April, sending them into safe hiding under armed guard because 'the federal government had recently seized 3 million N95 masks purchased by Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker.' This airlift from Seoul 'shouldn't have been necessary,' Hogan writes, but 'I'd watched as the president downplayed the outbreak's severity and as the White House failed to issue public warnings, draw up a 50-state strategy, or dispatch medical gear or lifesaving ventilators from the national stockpile to American hospitals. Eventually, it was clear that waiting around for the president to run the nation's response was hopeless.' Dr. Anthony Fauci and other federal health experts gave a dire, 'unfiltered,' and prescient briefing to Americans governors in early February, Hogan writes, and 'it was jarring, the huge contrast between the experts' warnings and the president's public dismissals' He detailed things Trump did and said, and more importantly, the things he did not do. 'Governors always do the hard work, make the tough decisions and take the political heat,' Hogan writes. 'But an undertaking as large as a national testing program required Washington's help. We expected something more than constant heckling from the man who was supposed to be our leader. Trump soon disabused us of that expectation.' Read the essay at The Washington Post.
