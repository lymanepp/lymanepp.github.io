      <title>How does Brady do it? Starts with science, ends with something less precise...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/How-does-Tom-Brady-do-it-It-starts-with-science-14280905.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point it's fair to say that Tom Brady's personal science project is going well. He just celebrated his 42nd birthday with a new two-year contract extension, and he apparently runs faster than he did at 22, his legs limber and alive, which is to say nothing of that ring-heavy throwing arm. In his 20thNFL training camp, he's so radiant with health that he looks like he's got spring water for blood and years left.  Clearly, scoffers who called Brady quackish owe him an apology. He was right, and they were wrong. He was way ahead of his time in perceiving the evils of an NFL culture based on heavy weightlifting and painkillers and ditching them for a range of unconventional training methods. His elastic, tenacious body is the empirical proof, more convincing than any lab result. Of all of Brady's time-defiant feats, maybe the most impressive one is his physical resilience over the past decade from the age of 32 onward: In nine of his past 10 seasons he has started all 16 games. The only thing that could keep him off a field was NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's tyrannical suspension in 2016. So laugh at Brady's avocado-chia smoothies if you want, but his habits line up with everything scientists know about anti-aging and avoiding illnesses such as arthritis.  None of it, however, explains how Brady keeps his mind right. How does he fight mental burnout and keep summoning the readiness to go through another August training camp? Years of success do not breed freshness in a quarterback. They breed expertise, regulation, know how. The wild raw physical music of a Patrick Mahomes is gone and so is the humbleness that begs to learn. What's left is pure tedious process. Mental exhaustion is what really gets most veteran quarterbacks, not the physical inability to perform. They get sick of it and choose liberation. What...</description>

      <title>FBI faces skepticism...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/FBI-faces-skepticism-over-its-anti-domestic-14279800.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The FBI insists it is fully engaged in combating the threat of violence from white supremacists, but some former federal officials charge that the government is still coming up short in the face of a strain of American terrorism that now seems resurgent.  The weekend massacre at a Walmart in El Paso has focused public debate once again on the issue, after federal prosecutors called it an act of domestic terrorism.  In recent congressional testimony, senior FBI officials said they were conducting about 850 domestic terrorism investigations - a decrease from a year earlier, when there were roughly 1,000. The category covers more than just racist-motivated violence, but officials say such motivations are a large part of their domestic terrorism caseload.  Yet by other measures, the threat of white nationalist violence appears to be rising. Between October and June, there were about 100 arrests of domestic terrorism suspects - and if that trend continues, the total for 2019 would outpace the prior year, when there were about 120 such cases. The year before that, about 150 domestic terrorism suspects were arrested.  "Our focus is on the violence," FBI Director Christopher Wray insisted at a congressional hearing two weeks ago. "We, the FBI, don't investigate ideology, no matter how repugnant. . . . When it turns to violence, we're all over it."  That poses particular challenges in the world of white supremacists, who often do not belong to specific groups but find congregations of similar-minded people online, and feed each other's anger and hate.  That general lack of centralized groups or leaders among many white supremacists presents legal challenges to investigators, according to law enforcement officials. And in some cases, it shortens the time period from which a person may adopt extremist views and then...</description>

      <title>Weekend of mass killing reflects how violence goes viral... </title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Weekend-of-mass-killing-reflects-how-American-14279885.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In El Paso, Dayton and Chicago, a weekend of horrific gun violence seemed on the surface to be another spasm of disconnected mayhem, people taking the lives of others almost at random. But on closer examination, the attacks served to illustrate how America's lone wolf shooters aren't really alone.  Whether the proximate cause was political or personal, whether it grew out of ideological indoctrination, mental illness or some toxic blend of factors that left shooters isolated and damaged, each attack demonstrated a troubling disorder festering in modern America.  The 21-year-old man who allegedly killed 20 people doing their Saturday shopping in El Paso, Texas, appears to have taken pains to post a manifesto that leaned heavily on the virulently anti-immigrant rhetoric that inspired recent mass shootings in New Zealand and California, authorities said - though they were still working to confirm its authenticity.  The suspect, Patrick Crusius, did not appear to be part of any organized group, but the four-page screed posted minutes before he opened fire parroted the extreme white supremacist ideology known as "the great replacement" - the idea that newcomers are taking the jobs of white Christians in America and other Western nations.  The alleged killer of nine people in Dayton, Ohio, Connor Betts, was a 24-year-old Chipotle worker and community college student driven by personal grievance rather than political ideology, authorities said. Betts, who was killed by police, shot his own sister among his victims.  Showing up outside a popular bar around 1 a.m. wearing body armor and carrying a high-capacity rifle and extra magazines, the Dayton shooter instantly joined the ranks of gunmen who have learned online, in video games and in countless movies and TV shows how to escalate personal beefs into community-shattering...</description>
