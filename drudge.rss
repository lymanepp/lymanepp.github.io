      <title>AMAZON threatens to fire critics outspoken on its environmental policies...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Amazon-threatens-to-fire-critics-who-are-14944463.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SEATTLE - Amazon has warned at least two employees who publicly criticized the company's environmental policies that they could be fired for future violations of its communications policy.  A lawyer in the e-commerce giant's employee-relations group sent a letter to two workers quoted in an October Washington Post report, accusing them of violating the company's external communications policy. An email sent to Maren Costa, a principal user-experience designer at the company, and reviewed by The Post warned that future infractions could "result in formal corrective action, up to and including termination of your employment with Amazon."  The lawyer in the human resources group, Eric Sjoding, advised Costa in the Nov. 22 email to "review the policy again and in the future anytime you may consider speaking about Amazon's business in a public forum."  (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)  Costa and Jamie Kowalski, an Amazon software development engineer, told The Post in a joint statement in October that the company is contributing to climate change as its cloud computing business aids oil- and gas-company exploration. Costa also met with Amazon's human resources department to discuss the matter in October.  "It was scary to be called into a meeting like that, and then to be given a follow-up email saying that if I continued to speak up, I could be fired," Costa said via email, referring to Amazon's warnings to her. "But I spoke up because I'm terrified by the harm the climate crisis is already causing, and I fear for my children's future."  Costa said she will not be silenced.  "It's our moral responsibility to speak up - regardless of Amazon's attempt to censor us - especially when climate poses such an unprecedented threat to humanity,"...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN JOSE (BCN)  A man was arrested Sunday in San Jose after police allegedly linked him to two cameras found in a Starbucks bathroom, police said.  Officers responded at 4:54 p.m. to the Starbucks at 1815 Hillsdale Ave. after someone called and told police that a camera was found in a drain pipe in front of the toilet. Officers found another camera under the sink, also in front of the toilet.  Outside, officers found a suspect, 37-year-old San Jose resident Shawn Evans, in a parked vehicle. Officers allegedly found electronic devices and other evidence linking Evans to the cameras inside the coffee shop.  Evans was arrested on suspicion of invasion of privacy and drug-related offenses. Police said they found methamphetamine and a glass pipe for smoking drugs inside Evans's vehicle.  Evans apparently had a warrant for his arrest for allegedly possessing drugs and drug paraphernalia.  Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the Police Department's sexual assault investigations unit at (408) 277-4102. People who want to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (408) 947-7867.  Copyright © 2020 by Bay City News, Inc.

      <title>How we survive the surveillance apocalypse... </title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/How-we-survive-the-surveillance-apocalypse-14943110.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Go, go gadgets" has long been the attitude in my house. Perhaps yours, too: A smartphone made it easier to stay in touch. A smart TV streamed a zillion more shows. A smart speaker let you talk to a smart thermostat without getting out of bed. That's progress, right?  Now I've got a new attitude: It's not just what I can get out of technology - I want to know what the technology gets out of me.  For the past year, I've been on the trail of the secret life of our data. What happens when you put your iPhone to sleep at night? Does Amazon's Alexa eavesdrop on your family? Who gets to know where you drive - and where you swipe your credit card?  Trying to get straight answers has been, literally, a full-time job. I've digested the legal word salad of privacy policies, interrogated a hundred companies and even hacked into a car dashboard to grab my data back. There are lots of stories about online threats, but it feels different watching your personal information streaming out of devices you take for granted. This year I learned there is no such thing as "incognito." Just stepping out for an errand, I discovered, lets my car record where I shop, what I listen to and even how much I weigh.  Learning how everyday things spy on us made me, at times, feel paranoid. Mostly, my privacy project left me angry. Our cultural reference points - Big Brother and tinfoil hats - don't quite capture the sickness of an era when we gleefully carry surveillance machines in our pockets and install them in our homes.  With each discovery, I've looked for ways to change my own relationship with technology. I've stopped installing new smart-home devices that let corporations or police log what's happening at my house. I switched web browsers and credit cards. When possible, I use a pseudonym or a throwaway email address.  Still, I'm going to level...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn't take a crystal ball to see that the Middle East's 2020 will be tumultuous. Libya's civil war has taken a dangerous turn, with Russian mercenaries and Turkish forces joining the fray as Gen. Khalifa Hifter's forces push into the capital. Yemen's still ravaged by economic blockade and war, despite recent efforts on all sides to de-escalate the conflict. Syria's civil war continues to metastasize, with a massive new wave of refugees fleeing violence in Idlib. Large-scale popular protests are challenging Iraq's government, which is bracing for fallout from the growing confrontation between the United States and Iran. Israel and the Palestinian territories could dramatically change their relationship, as the prospects of a two-state solution dissolve. And protest movements throughout the region could shake up half a dozen regimes.  Here are three trends to watch in the Middle East over the coming year.  1. Every government is on edge about the U.S. 2020 election  Usually, when the U.S. government changes hands, U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East remains steady and consistent. No more. If a Democrat replaces Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Middle Eastern regimes expect sharply reversed policies on such front-line issues as the nuclear agreement with Iran, the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, relations with Turkey, and alliances in the Gulf. If Trump remains in office, he will be unleashed, convinced by his electoral success that even his most controversial policies were right.  Facing such different possible futures, Middle Eastern governments could choose one of two approaches. They have good reason to be cautious, reaching out to both sides of the American partisan divide to ensure continuity in their relations. But some may see a closing window of opportunity for cherished goals - including potentially...</description>

      <title>Dems sharpen differences as Iowa looms...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Democrats-sharpen-their-differences-as-Iowa-14942493.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DES MOINES, Iowa - The Democratic presidential candidates spent the final day of 2019 sharpening their differences as they braced for the final sprint to the Iowa caucuses, with polls showing a fluid and unsettled race five weeks before the first nominating contest.  And as the year neared its conclusion on Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., knocked on doors in near-freezing temperatures in Des Moines and called attention to how he differs from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on health care. Warren delivered a speech in Boston that urged sweeping change and took veiled shots at Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former vice president Joe Biden over fundraising.  The busy Tuesday on the campaign trail culminated a rush of late December events that helped define the fault lines for the Iowa push. A day earlier Buttigieg put a renewed spotlight on Biden's dealings in Ukraine when he said he "would not have wanted to see" his son serving on the board of a natural gas company there. Biden, for his part, said this week he would consider tapping a Republican for vice president, embracing a centrist idea that accentuates the contrast with his liberal rivals.  The crossfire reflects the candidates' urgency to perform well in Iowa at a moment when polls suggest any of the top four candidates could win the state. Each believes a victory on Feb. 3 - when Democrats will caucus at more than 1,000 precinct locations - could provide a critical breakthrough.  Adding to the volatility is the uncertainty around President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, which could unfold at any time in January. Republicans have been seeking to shift attention to Biden and his son Hunter, despite no evidence of wrongdoing on their part, while the senators in the race have been trying to make every minute count before they may be stuck in...</description>
