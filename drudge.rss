      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beto O'Rourke is running ... to Metallica's El Paso concert, apparently. O'Rourke was spotted at the Texas show on Thursday night, according to journalist Ivan Pierre Aguirre, who posted pictures of the former congressman looking extremely out of place drowned in a sea of Metallica T-shirts. .@BetoORourke is in attendance at the @Metallica concert at #UTEP tonight. Could he announce is Presidential bid here?? It is the last day of the month after-all. #beto2020 #2020elections #OnAssignment #elpaso #ept #beto pic.twitter.com/hn2wsYppU2 â€” Ivan Pierre Aguirre (@i_p_a_1) March 1, 2019 O'Rourke had previously teased that he'd make a decision about whether he'll run for president in 2020 by the end of February, more recently saying on Wednesday that a decision about his future has been made and an announcement will come soon. But we're sad to report that a day later, O'Rourke did not, in fact, make history by becoming the first presidential candidate to announce his White House bid after smashing a guitar on stage at a Metallica show. Then again, with Metallica's ongoing tour making one more Texas stop on Saturday, it's certainly not too late.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a moment when the country has never seemed angrier, two political commentators from opposite sides of the divide concurred last week on one point, nearly unthinkable until recently: The country is on the verge of "civil war." First came former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova, a Fox News regular and ally of President Trump. "We are in a civil war," he said. "The suggestion that there's ever going to be civil discourse in this country for the foreseeable future is over. . . . It's going to be total war." The next day, Nicolle Wallace, a former Republican operative turned MSNBC commentator and Trump critic, played a clip of diGenova's commentary on her show and agreed with him - although she placed the blame squarely on the president.</description>
