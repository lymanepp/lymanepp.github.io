      <title>Lipstick in kindergarten? Beauty industry now aims for super young...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Lipstick-in-kindergarten-South-Korea-s-K-beauty-13622108.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SEOUL, South Korea - Last year in kindergarten, Yang Hye-ji developed her morning routine. Uniform? Check. Homework? Check. Makeup? Definitely. "Makeup makes me look pretty," the 7-year-old said on her second visit to the ShuShu &amp; Sassy beauty spa in Seoul. She was wrapped in a child-size pink robe and wearing a bunny hairband. Her face was gently touched up with a puff. Her lips got a swipe of pink gloss. South Korea's cosmetics industry, known as K-beauty, has become an Asian powerhouse and global phenomenon for its rigorous step-by-step regimens. But exacting beauty norms also put enormous pressure on South Korean women, making the country one of the world's centers for plastic surgery.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five Democratic senators vying for their party's nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020 are fanning out across the country Saturday to campaign and meet voters. Kamala Harris of California plans to spend her second straight day in the pivotal early-voting state of South Carolina, holding a town hall meeting in Columbia, the capital. Also visiting the state is Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who's set to meet voters in Greenville before heading to Georgia — an unusual early stop for a White House hopeful but one that signals Democratic hopes to make inroads in the South.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MUNICH (AP) — German Chancellor Angela Merkel robustly defended European nations' decision to stand by the Iran nuclear deal in a spirited backing Saturday of her multilateral approach to global affairs, but U.S. Vice President Mike Pence promptly accused Europe of once again undermining the United States. Merkel's comments at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of top global defense and foreign policy officials, followed days of tensions between Washington and Europe over Iran.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly a year in space put astronaut Scott Kelly's immune system on high alert and changed the activity of some of his genes compared to his Earth-bound identical twin, researchers said Friday. Scientists don't know if the changes were good or bad but results from a unique NASA twins study are raising new questions for doctors as the space agency aims to send people to Mars. Tests of the genetic doubles gave scientists a never-before opportunity to track details of human biology, such as how an astronaut's genes turn on and off in space differently than at home. One puzzling change announced Friday at a science conference: Kelly's immune system was hyperactivated.</description>

      <title>Space junk harpooned like whale in orbit-cleanup test...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/066f28f2c2d04fd89ec15f7d43c99d88</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A harpoon flung from a satellite has successfully captured a piece of pretend space junk, like a whale. The British-led experiment is part of an effort to clean up debris in orbit, hundreds of miles above Earth. The University of Surrey's Guglielmo Aglietti said Friday that the steel-tipped harpoon scored a bull's-eye last Friday. The harpoon — no bigger than a writing pen — pierced an aluminum panel the size of a table tennis racket attached to the end of a satellite boom. The distance was just 5 feet (1.5 meters), but researchers were delighted.</description>

      <title>Spain to get 3rd govt in 4 years amid fragmenting politics...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/2615b904b41f4325b2390c4ce3e900c4</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MADRID (AP) — Spain will elect its third government in less than four years after Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's fragile socialist government acknowledged Friday its support had evaporated and called an early general election. Sanchez's eight-month-old administration met its end after failing to get parliament's approval for its 2019 budget proposal earlier this week, adding to the political uncertainty that has dogged Spain in recent years. "Between doing nothing and continuing without a budget, or giving the chance for Spaniards to speak, Spain should continue looking ahead," Sanchez said in a televised appearance from the Moncloa Palace, the seat of government, after an urgent Cabinet meeting.</description>
