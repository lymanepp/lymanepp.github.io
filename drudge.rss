      <title>BALZ: 'Very real threat': Four more years of Trump...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Candidates-face-very-real-threat-Four-more-15040026.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CONCORD, N.H. - There was one big issue on the table when the Democratic candidates met for their debate at Saint Anselm College here on Friday: Was anyone on the stage capable of defeating a newly emboldened President Donald Trump?  There was no simple answer, but Tom Steyer, the billionaire businessman, put the issue in stark terms, warning that, after the events of the past week, there is now a "very real threat" that the president will be reelected. "Who can go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump?" he asked. "Who can take down Mr. Trump?"  The dilemma for Democratic voters is that no one candidate has yet persuaded more than a fraction of the party that they are capable of doing so. Democrats came out of Iowa splintered and demoralized, and Friday's debate accentuated both the attributes each of the leading Democrats is offering and the limits of their appeal.  The debate plowed familiar ground, but there was an edge to it that was different from those of the recent past. Trump's acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial, fresh reports emphasizing a strong economy and a new poll showing Trump's approval at the highest point of his presidency only underscored the Democrats' current plight.  What emerged were a series of questions that Democratic voters will be considering not just here next week but in primaries and caucuses in the weeks ahead - questions from whether the party should move left or toward the center, to whether experience in Washington or freshness from outside would be more effective.  Former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who finished in a virtual tie in Iowa's bungled caucuses and appeared to be the two candidates to beat here in New Hampshire, were principal targets of the others on the stage. And it was former vice president Joe Biden, the fourth-place finisher in...</description>
