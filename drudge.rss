      <title>Rebekah Mercer orchestrates PARLER second act...</title>
      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/business/article/Major-Trump-backer-Rebekah-Mercer-orchestrates-15974906.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When social media website Parler's founding CEO John Matze was pushed out last month, it was at the direction of a quiet but powerful political megadonor backing the right-leaning site.  Rebekah Mercer, the 47-year-old daughter of major Republican donor Robert Mercer, is a founding investor of Parler. She increasingly pulls the strings at the company, according to people familiar with the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private business matters. She holds the majority stake in Parler and controlled two of three board seats as of early February - a board to which she recently appointed allies.  The social media company started garnering a name for itself last year as a friendly gathering spot for Republican politicians and pundits turned off by fact-checking and moderation on sites like Facebook and Twitter. But Parler, which publicly extolled itself as a free-speech-focused network with minimal rules, became a breeding ground for conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. The site was knocked offline shortly after the riot at the U.S. Capitol for its alleged role in allowing the rioters to plan and egg each other on.  Now Mercer, who is credited with helping get Donald Trump elected president in 2016, is working to revive the site. It came back online last week with her new handpicked CEO, former tea party patriots leader, Mark Meckler, at the helm. It's the latest in a long line of maneuvers by the Mercer family to create an alternative media industry that pushes a version of the news that fits with their right-wing, populist political agenda - while keeping a low profile themselves.  Parler executives did not respond to multiple requests for interviews or comment. Mercer did not respond to requests for comment.  Parler surged as an alternative to Twitter and Facebook during...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;oklahoman.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FEB 24, 2021 - CHICKASHA — A triple murder suspect has confessed, saying he killed a neighbor first and cut her heart out to eat at home, the OSBI reported. "He took the heart back to 214 West Minnesota, Chickasha," an agent with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation told a judge in a request for a search warrant. "He cooked the heart with potatoes to feed to his family to release the demons," the agent wrote. Lawrence Paul Anderson is accused of killing the neighbor at her home and then going to his home and killing his uncle and a 4-year-old girl on Feb. 9. He also is accused of stabbing his aunt. She survived. The case already has sparked outrage because the repeat felon had been released early from prison in</description>

      <title>NYC cases stubbornly high...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/968511/what-new-york-city-might-reveal-about-declining-covid19-infection-rates</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a whole, the United States is experiencing its most sustained and significant decline in confirmed COVID-19 infections since the virus first reached the country last year, but the situation does vary by region. On Tuesday, the question of why cases in New York City, the original U.S. epicenter, don't seem to be declining as quickly as the rest of the country. On Monday, for instance, New York's 14-day decline in cases was just 1 percent. Compared to the 40 percent national decline over that same period, that's pretty slow. Nobody has pinpointed a singular explanation (and there likely isn't one), but there are some simple, plausible theories you've probably heard before over the last 11 months. The most obvious one would be testing. The city government has reportedly hinted that it considers its testing program more robust than elsewhere, so it's still picking up more mild or asymptomatic cases of the virus, generally speaking, and a big drop in hospitalizations does seem to back up that notion. Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver theorized the disparity grew even more pronounced in recent weeks because bad weather limited the number of people who could access testing in many places. The weird pattern over the past week or two looks like a blip related to winter storms reducing testing volume. Although it's also true that NY's numbers aren't declining *quite* as quickly as other places even once you smooth that out. https://t.co/gjUQIxpuum — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) February 23, 2021 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio addressed the question himself Tuesday, arguing that his city also was starting from a high peak. Tim O'Donnell I asked Mayor Bill de Blasio why covid cases aren't dropping in New York City as fast as the rest of the nation.His health commissioner says cases are dropping from a peak of 6,000/day.The mayor: 'I feel very good about our ability to turn it around with intensive vaccination.' pic.twitter.com/nZkICdWuRP — Emma G.

      <title>COHEN:  He's headed for jail!</title>
      <link>https://news.yahoo.com/michael-cohen-predicts-trump-tax-210300790.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;news.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former President Donald Trump's ex-attorney Michael Cohen told MSNBC's Katy Tur that he thinks his old client ought to start looking into getting a "custom made jumpsuit." Cohen's prediction that Trump could wind up in jail came a few hours after the Supreme Court ruled that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance can obtain Trump's tax returns as part of New York prosecutors' investigation into his past business dealings. Cohen said he's not sure what exactly the documents may reveal, but was confident enough to claim "it does not look good for" Trump. . @MichaelCohen212 says Trump should look into getting a "custom made jumpsuit, because it does not look good for him."@JoyceWhiteVance says Cy Vance has "sent signals that this is a serious investigation." pic.twitter.com/gBW5rc5PXs — MSNBC Live with Katy Tur (@KatyOnMSNBC) February 22, 2021 Cohen, of course, may not be the most neutral prognosticator — the disbarred lawyer, who is serving a prison sentence under house arrest after pleading guilty to multiple counts of campaign finance violations and fraud in 2018, has become one of Trump's most prominent public enemies in recent years and even testified against him before Congress in 2019. Tur's other guest, former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance (no relation to Cyrus Vance), felt it was unwise to predict the result of the investigation, but she did argue the Manhattan DA has sent signals the probe has been a "serious" and "productive" one, and he may proceed toward indictment.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.msn.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MIAMI — Wildlife managers in Florida are finally moving to address an existential question: If the state is like an all-you-can eat buffet for invasive reptiles originally introduced as exotic pets, then why are some of those species still imported and sold by breeders and pet stores? Until 2010, the now infamous Burmese python was easily found at pet stores across Florida, even as scientific ...</description>

      <title>Life amid ruins of QANON: 'I wanted my family back'...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;She bought ammunition, camping gear, a water purifier and boxes of canned food. Then, Tyler's mother started wearing a holstered pistol around the house, convinced that 10 days of unrest and mass power outages were coming.  The chaos would culminate, she assured her son, in former president Donald Trump's triumphant return to power on March 4, the original Inauguration Day before the passage of the 20th Amendment in 1932.  Tyler, 24, had been living with his mother an hour north of Minneapolis since he graduated college in 2019. The paranoia and fear that had engulfed his home had become unbearable in the months since Trump began to falsely claim that the 2020 election had been stolen from him.  "Any advice for dealing with a qanon parent who thinks ww3 will happen during the inauguration?" Tyler asked last month on r/QAnonCasualties, a fast-growing Reddit group for those whose loved ones have been consumed by the bizarre and byzantine universe of baseless conspiracy theories known as QAnon.  "Do they have weapons?" one of the site's moderators asked.  "Yep. A lot of them," Tyler replied. "I would leave, but I don't have anywhere to go." He said he couldn't imagine cutting ties to his mother.  In Washington, rioters, inflamed by unfounded allegations of a stolen election, had stormed the Capitol leaving five dead and triggering the impeachment of a president. Far from Washington, the falsehoods that had whipped so many into a frenzy were wreaking a different sort of chaos; one that was tearing families apart.  Family members spoke of their loved ones as if they were cult members or drug addicts, sucked in by social media companies and self-serving politicians who warped their views of reality. They begged and bargained with parents and partners to put down their phones for...</description>
