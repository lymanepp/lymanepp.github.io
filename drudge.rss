      <title>Pentagon issues forceful rebuke of ORACLE as debate over massive federal contract turns caustic...</title>
      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/Pentagon-issues-forceful-rebuke-of-Oracle-as-14268151.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Pentagon has issued an unusually strong rebuke of Oracle over the weekend, accusing the company of employing "poorly-informed and often manipulative speculation" in its efforts to undermine the military's process of awarding a massive 10-year contract for cloud computing technology.  The remarks were the latest flash point in the long-running dispute over the bidding process for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, a $10 billion contract that would be one of the federal government's most expensive information technology procurements ever.  Oracle alleged in a lawsuit that the Defense Department's bidding process has been plagued with potential conflicts of interest and rigged in favor of Amazon's cloud computing business. Oracle's attempt to block the award was rejected earlier this month, with the judge in charge of the case explaining his reasoning in a lengthy document unsealed Friday. But in his decision, the judge posed new questions about the Pentagon's legal argument for awarding one big contract.  Department of Defense spokeswoman Elissa Smith noted in a statement that the judge also affirmed that the Pentagon was "reasonably justified" to award a single contract. Despite the "tension" in the judge's ruling, the department has said it plans to move ahead and award the contract in August, nearly a year and a half after it was announced.  Smith's statement, which was emailed to reporters Sunday night, also contained the harsh words for Oracle. Smith appeared to take a second swipe at the company as well: "DOD officials directly involved in the work of this procurement along with the senior leaders charged with making the critical decisions related to JEDI have always placed the interests of the warfighter first and have acted without bias, prejudice, or self-interest. The same...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Side shot! Side shot! Side shot!"  It's Mueller Day in Washington, and the man calling out instructions in the darkened control room of CNN's Washington bureau gets his wish as the screens on the wall in front him, along with TV screens across the country, change at his command. These decisions are usually made by one of the network's many producers, but this particular camera angle was emphatically suggested by none other than network president Jeff Zucker, who came down from New York to prepare for this week's Democratic primary debate and decided to make a quick stop in the control room. Mueller's halting testimony was not making for the most riveting TV, and Zucker was doing his best to liven things up.  Zucker has long prided himself on his ability to do just that. He oversaw NBC's "Today" show in its prime Katie Couric years. He bought the reality show "The Apprentice," which turned into a monster hit and turned Donald Trump into a TV star. But since he has come to CNN, the network has been in third place in the cable-news ratings race, and someone, somewhere - often but certainly not exclusively the resident of the White House - always seems to be pointing out how CNN is messing up.  The first debates last month on NBC networks set viewership records for Democratic primary season, and now CNN plays host for two nights with 20 candidates in Detroit on Tuesday and Wednesday. It's the network's biggest moment yet in the 2020 election cycle - an election cycle that could serve as a sort of do-over for Zucker, for CNN and for the media in general.  Zucker came under intense criticism for CNN's mode of coverage in the 2016 election. He has acknowledged some mistakes while defending the network overall, and vows that this time will be different.
