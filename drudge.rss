      <title>President tells aides to look for big spending cuts in 'second-term'...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/President-Trump-tells-aides-to-look-for-big-14109681.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has instructed aides to prepare for sweeping budget cuts if he wins a second term in the White House, five people briefed on the discussions said, a move that would dramatically reverse the big-spending approach he adopted during his first 30 months in office.  Trump's advisers say he will be better positioned to crack down on spending and shrink or eliminate certain agencies after next year, particularly if Republicans regain control of the House of Representatives.  But this second-term ambition is already seeding confusion about how the White House should approach the current slate of negotiations, in which some conservatives want Trump to push for spending restraint.  Instead, Trump is advocating swiftly lifting the federal debt ceiling, which would allow for more spending and borrowing. Trump, who was once a fierce promoter of refusing the raise the debt ceiling without winning concessions, said the opposite on Friday, telling reporters that "it's a sacred element of our country. They can't use the debt ceiling to negotiate."  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the debt ceiling needs to be increased by early September to avoid a potentially catastrophic default. That puts enormous pressure on Congress to act, because lawmakers leave at the end of next week for the remainder of the summer.  Mnuchin has forged several parts of a new budget agreement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., but the talks bogged down in recent days after other Trump advisers sent Democrats a request for $150 billion in spending cuts.  With Mnuchin pushing for a deal and the other advisers, largely acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and acting budget director Russell Vought, seeking big cuts, the White House has lacked a consistent argument during the debates, something that is likely to...</description>

Thousands of passengers were stuck on platforms and in trains on one of the hottest days of the year in the second major infrastructure failure in New York in less than a week, following a Con Edison-related power outage on Manhattan's West Side last weekend.</description>
