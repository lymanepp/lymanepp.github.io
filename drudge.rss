      <title>Exotic dancer, nuclear engineer, QAnon enthusiast, Laura Loomer: GOP race to represent Trump's Palm Beach district...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/An-exotic-dancer-a-nuclear-engineer-a-QAnon-15488787.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PALM BEACH, Fla. - In a congressional race where an acolyte of Roger Stone who's been banned by Twitter and Facebook may not even be the most unconventional candidate, voters in the Republican primary for Florida's 21st Congressional District have a rich array of choices.  The six people competing in the Aug. 18 primary include a former burlesque dancer and wild animal exhibitor who did business in the same circles as "Tiger King" Joe Exotic; a Palm Beach neighbor of Mar-a-Lago who is supported by QAnon believers; and Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator and anti-Islam activist who calls herself "the most banned woman on the Internet" and who once handcuffed herself to the front door of Twitter's office in New York.  There's also an ex-cop, a nuclear engineer-turned college professor and a retired investigator for the IRS.  Among the constituents they hope to represent: the president and first lady. The Trumps registered as Republicans in Palm Beach County in October when President Trump changed his official domicile from Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach. They both voted by mail in the March presidential primary.  All six candidates are political newcomers running in a heavily Democratic district that covers Palm Beach, West Palm Beach and parts of Broward County. One of them will face Lois Frankel, a Democrat who ran unopposed two years ago, or her primary opponent, Guido Weiss, a former legislative assistant for Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.  Regardless of their long shot chances of winning the congressional seat in the fall, the GOP candidates are being scrutinized due to Trump's decision last year to call the district home.  Loomer's campaign manager is Karen Giorno, who was a senior political adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016. She said the president's team wants the congressional seat - which...</description>
