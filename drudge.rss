      <title>Migrants get cool reception in Mexican town...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/cecfafdd898b478b81afb20a1e4f4279</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) — Many of the nearly 3,000 Central American migrants who have reached the Mexican border with California via caravan said Saturday they do not feel welcome in the city of Tijuana, where hundreds more migrants are headed after more than a month on the road. The vast majority were camped at an outdoor sports complex, sleeping on a dirt baseball field and under bleachers with a view of the steel walls topped by barbed wire at the newly reinforced U.S.-Mexico border. The city opened the complex after other shelters were filled to capacity. Church groups provided portable showers, bathrooms and sinks. The federal government estimates the migrant crowd in Tijuana could soon swell to 10,000.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARADISE, Calif. (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday acknowledged Californians suffering from twin tragedies, walking through the ashes of a mobile home and RV park in a small northern town all but destroyed by deadly wildfires and privately consoling people grieving after a mass shooting at a popular college bar outside Los Angeles. "This has been a tough day when you look at all of the death from one place to the next," Trump said before flying back to Washington.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEALE AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) — President Donald Trump took a helicopter tour Saturday over the Northern California landscape scorched by a killer wildfire. A full cover of haze and the smell of smoke greeted the president upon his arrival at an Air Force base, as did the governor and his successor. Trump planned to hear from those leaders about the dire situation and talk with first responders, and later was expected to travel several hundred miles south to visit with victims of a recent country music bar shooting.</description>
