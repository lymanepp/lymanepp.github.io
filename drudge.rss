      <title>Bernie gets tough reception at minority women's event, signaling challenges ahead... </title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Sanders-gets-tough-reception-at-minority-women-s-13793574.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOUSTON - The groans erupted halfway through Bernie Sanders' appearance Wednesday at a presidential candidates' forum sponsored by She the People, a group that aims to drive up voter participation among women of color.  Before an audience of about 1,700, many of them African-American and Hispanic women, the moderator asked Sanders, I-Vt., how he would handle the rise in white supremacy. Sanders spoke of fighting discrimination and running a campaign "to bring our people together around an agenda that speaks to all people" - then returned to a familiar message on universal health care.  For many in the audience, that was insufficient. "Come on!" a woman shouted from the back, as others began to jeer and boo.  The reception reflected Sanders' struggle to win support from minority voters, a problem that dogged his 2016 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. Sanders has taken steps since to improve his outreach, including meeting with black leaders and talking more frequently about the difficulties facing minorities, but Wednesday's event suggested the senator still faces challenges.  Sanders at one point mentioned his long record on civil rights, but it did little to mollify the crowd.  "I was actually at the March on Washington with Dr. King back in 1963, and - as somebody who actively supported Jesse Jackson's campaign, as one of the few white elected officials to do so in '88 - I have dedicated my life to the fight against racism and sexism and discrimination of all forms," Sanders said. That prompted audible groans.  Sanders may have come into the event at a disadvantage, since many black women supported Clinton in 2016. Some Clinton backers believe Sanders did too little to help her after she won the nomination.  Sanders did eventually coax a warmer reception when he...</description>

      <title>High school's new dress code bans leggings, pajamas -- for parents...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-high-school-s-new-dress-code-bans-leggings-13791086.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not exactly unusual for school dress codes to become a source of controversy. But the latest flare-up has a new twist: This time, it's parents being told what they can and can't wear on campus.  As the Houston Chronicle first reported, one high school principal warned parents earlier this month that they will be turned away if they show up at their child's school wearing hair rollers, leggings, silk bonnets or any other items on a list of banned clothing. The announcement followed a widely publicized incident in which a prospective parent was turned away from the school for showing up in a T-shirt dress and headscarf.  "We are preparing your child for a prosperous future," Carlotta Outley Brown, the principal of James Madison High School in Houston, wrote in a letter to parents on April 9. "We want them to know what is appropriate and what is not appropriate for any setting they might be in."  To many parents, KTRK reported, the dress code appeared to be laden with racial undertones. For one thing, it didn't apply to the whole school district, just to one high school with a majority of minority and low-income students. According to the Houston Independent School District, 58 percent of the students at Madison High School are Hispanic, and 40 percent are African American. Nearly three-quarters of the students are eligible for free and reduced-price lunch.  "I'm almost insulted," said Tomiko Miller, the mother of a current student, told the Chronicle. "I really think it was discriminatory, the language that was used. It was demeaning. And I'm African American - and if it's misty outside and I have a hair bonnet on, I don't see how that's anyone's business."  In her letter to parents, Brown wrote that sagging pants or shorts were off limits, and men couldn't arrive in undershirts. Low-cut tops were banned, as were...</description>
