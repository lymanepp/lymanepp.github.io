The journalist's death a year ago reverberated across India. She was given a state funeral in Bangalore, and thousands marched in protest around the country, chanting, "I am Gauri.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.beaumontenterprise.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The toxic algae bloom that has carved a trail of dead animals and triggered a putrid stench along western Florida's coastline has drifted further north, killing hundreds of thousands of fish in the Tampa Bay region. The legions of dead fish were reported in a 20-mile stretch of coastline from Clearwater to St. Petersburg, environmental officials with Pinellas County told the Tampa Bay Times on Saturday. County workers roamed beaches and trawled offshore to collect the fish carcasses to head off decomposition as some beachgoers turned back. Rotting fish and the strong odor of the algae has previously repelled locals and imperiled Florida's vital tourism sector for much of the summer.</description>
