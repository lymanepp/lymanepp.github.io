      <title>Keeping loved ones from visiting patients making them sicker...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/article/Keeping-loved-ones-from-visiting-our-coronavirus-15463298.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly six months into the coronavirus pandemic, an emptiness lingers at the bedsides of our patients in hospitals wards and intensive care units. Though some hospitals are trying out limited visitation policies, most are not, leaving too many of our patients without loved ones at their side. The trauma to families, while difficult to measure, is immense, and the absence of loved ones is making things worse for patients and their medical care teams. It's as if we have fallen back in time.  ICUs of the 1990s were not inviting to families. We imposed uncompromising and paternalistic limits on visitation with patients. There was no sharing of power, or even knowledge. A patient's family was often viewed as preoccupied by minor concerns that paled in comparison to the physician's definitive vision of what was important. That period, in retrospect, was defined by a kind of testimonial injustice - a prevailing prejudice that deflated the authority of family and consolidated power solely within the medical team. Are we repeating that same injustice now?  What the virus that causes covid-19 brought - along with fear, contagion and uncertainty - is epistemic exclusion, which is to say that families are excluded from essential moments of their loved one's illness, recovery and dying process that would allow understanding and healing. There is simply no way the family, excluded from the bedside during a novel pandemic, can share the knowledge the team possesses. The best tools and patterns of communication on our digital devices are never going to be enough to allow someone to truly know what's going on in the hospital. And without families, care teams are missing essential knowledge about the patient. We are handicapping each other.  Take, for example, Fred Reyes, an ICU patient who, like so many others we've seen, is Hispanic...</description>

      <title>SHOCK TURNS TO ANGER</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Beirut-blast-death-toll-rises-to-100-with-more-15459969.php#item-85307-tbla-6</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIRUT - As dazed Lebanese picked through the wreckage inflicted by the massive explosion in their capital city on Wednesday, shock turned to anger at the corruption and incompetence that allowed a massive pile of dangerous chemicals to sit unattended in a warehouse at Beirut's port for six years.  An estimated 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer and bombmaking ingredient, has been identified as the immediate cause of the blast that engulfed the city on Tuesday, killing at least 135 people, injuring more than 3,000 and leaving more than 100 unaccounted for. The material had been stored in a warehouse since being seized by customs authorities in 2014, despite repeated warnings from port officials that it was a risk.  Government investigators still have not pinpointed the origin of the fire or explosion that erupted some 15 to 20 minutes before the ammonium nitrate ignited, sending a vast mushroom cloud of toxic gases rippling across the city. The blast was heard 150 miles away on the island of Cyprus.  Beirut has witnessed many explosions, including the bombing of the U.S. Marine Barracks in 1983 that killed 241 Marines, the assassination of the former prime minister Rafic Hariri in 2005 and the countless small blasts of the mortars and shells that rained down on the city during the civil war from 1975 to 1990.  This was by far the biggest - and the shock waves reverberated beyond the immediate tragedy of lost lives and homes. It seemed to encapsulate everything that is wrong with Lebanon at this juncture in its turbulent history: A weak state, inept government, corrupt officials and, many said, the existence of a parallel state run by the powerful Hezbollah movement, as well as other Lebanese factions that used the port for their own smuggling operations.  "People saw firsthand with devastating results what it...</description>
