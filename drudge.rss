      <title>How much does ticket to space cost? Meet people ready to fly....</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/How-much-does-a-ticket-to-space-cost-Meet-the-14485562.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lori Fraleigh unwrapped the present her husband had given her for her 38th birthday, she found a curious surprise: a model of a spaceship. It was cool, sure, but a toy would be better suited for her young children, then 5 and 1, not her.  Then she noticed the ticket. It took Fraleigh, a Silicon Valley executive, a moment to realize what her husband had purchased for her: a trip to space with Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic. "I went through a lot of crazy emotions, like, 'Did you really buy this?'" she recalled of the moment in 2011. " 'Do we still have enough money to remodel the kitchen?'"  Today, her children are 13 and 9. The kitchen remodel has long since been completed. But Fraleigh is still waiting for her trip to space.  For years, Branson has been pushing a quixotic vision for the future, where his spacecraft would ferry passengers off Earth as frequently as airplanes. But for all the talk about a new Space Age full of citizen astronauts, the journey has been fitful, and filled with setbacks, including the death of a test pilot in 2014 after a harrowing crash.  But now, 15 years after Branson founded Virgin Galactic, space tourism could be tantalizingly close to becoming a reality. The company has flown to the edge of space twice and says its first paying customers could reach space next year. Another space venture, Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos almost 20 years ago, hopes to conduct its first test flight with people this year, though it hasn't announced prices or sold any tickets. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)  And NASA recently announced that it would allow private citizens to fly to the International Space Station on spacecraft built by SpaceX and Boeing.  Which means that Fraleigh may soon finally get her five minutes of weightlessness, a view that promises to...</description>

      <title>Leaking classified information is 'thievery, not protected speech,' Justice Dept says... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Leaking-classified-information-is-thievery-not-14484074.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALEXANDRIA, Va. - A contractor accused of leaking classified information engaged in "thievery, not protected speech," and has no First Amendment grounds to challenge his Espionage Act prosecutions, the Justice Department said in an Alexandria federal court filing.  Former intelligence analyst Daniel Hale shared National Security Agency details of drone warfare with the website The Intercept, according to an indictment filed in May. His defense attorneys argued last month that the law was designed to deal with spies, not leakers, and that the prosecution runs afoul of the First Amendment by chilling newsgathering and implicating the reporter who received the information.  It's an argument that probably will resurface if Julian Assange, facing prosecution in the same courthouse for publishing classified information, is ever extradited. The government rarely prosecuted leakers until President Barack Obama's tenure, and the Trump administration is the first president to prosecute the publisher of classified information along with the leaker.  Prosecutors pushed back in their own motion Monday, saying Hale signed nondisclosure agreements that made the law clear.  "Hale expressly waived in writing his right to disclose the national security information he obtained while in his government position," Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Berrang wrote.  Whether Congress intended the Espionage Act to cover leaks when the law was drafted during World War I, Berrang says, "may be interesting thought exercises but are irrelevant to the case at hand."  He also called it "dubious" to suggest there should be any legal distinction between leakers and spies.  "While spies typically pass classified national defense information to a specific foreign government, leakers, through the internet,...</description>

      <title>Any challenge to his presidency is attack on America... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/In-Trump-s-telling-a-challenge-to-his-presidency-14484365.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - For President Donald Trump, the impeachment case being built by Democrats over his alleged effort to recruit foreign help for his reelection effort isn't just a "WITCH HUNT," though he calls it that, too; it's "treason." It isn't just "presidential harassment," though he also makes that charge; it's an invitation to "Civil War."  The president is bringing the rhetorical heavy artillery to the most serious challenge to his presidency in nearly three tumultuous, norm-busting, warp-speed years in office.  Expanding on the lexicon of outrage and victimhood honed during the probe into Russian interference in the last election, Trump is invoking the muskets-and-ramparts idioms of the country's beginnings.  The ratcheting up of his rhetoric is also indicative of Trump's tendency to interpret any criticism of him as an attack on the government, worrying critics and scholars who warn of the dangers posed by his l'état, c'est moi call to arms.  "Charging anyone with treason is a most unusual act in American history. It's an incendiary charge which relates to the ultimate crime: overthrow of the state," said Michael Glennon, an international law professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.  In setting out a definition and consequences for treason in the Constitution, including death, the Founders were guarding against the "danger that the charge of treason could be made irresponsibly against political opponents," he said, adding that cavalierly throwing around words like treason and civil war belies their unique meaning in American history.  "I suppose it has an incendiary effect on some supporters, but we are dealing with dynamite here," Glennon said.  Trump has focused his most pointed comments on Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and chairman of the...</description>
