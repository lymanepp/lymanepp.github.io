Steve King on Saturday at the Iowa congressman's first public event since being rebuked by his House colleagues over racist comments he had made to a newspaper earlier this month. King told the roughly 75 people who showed up for the first of 39 planned town hall meetings in his sprawling district that he doesn't adhere to a white supremacist ideology and he repeated his assertion that he's not racist.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — A man among a group of migrants detained in a desolate part of New Mexico near the border with Mexico has been diagnosed as infected with flesh-eating bacteria, the U.S. Border Patrol said Friday. The man was taken to a hospital in recent days after telling a federal agent that he had a growing rash on his leg, U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Carlos Antunez said. Flesh-eating bacteria are a rare condition called necrotizing fasciitis that spreads quickly and can be fatal. The bacteria usually gets into the body through a minor cut or scrape and can cause a serious infection that can destroy muscle, skin and other tissue.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — A dozen immigrant workers at one of President Donald Trump's golf clubs in New York who are in the U.S. illegally were fired this month even though managers had known about their legal status for years, a lawyer for the workers said Saturday. As the president railed during the partial government shutdown against immigrants coming into the country illegally, a manager at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County called a dozen immigrant workers into a room one by one Jan. 18 and fired them, said lawyer Anibal Romero.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone may be accused of lying and tampering with witnesses, but it's equally notable what he's not charged with: colluding with the Kremlin in a grand conspiracy to help Trump win the presidency in 2016. The case is the latest in a series brought by special counsel Robert Mueller that focuses on cover-ups but lays out no underlying crime. It's a familiar pattern in Washington, where scandals from Watergate to Iran-Contra and Whitewater have mushroomed into presidency-imperiling affairs due to efforts to conceal and mislead.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CARACAS, Venezuela - President Nicolás Maduro faced increasing international pressure to step down on Saturday, as European governments warned they would recognize his chief opponent as Venezuela's leader unless a date for new elections is called within eight days. The statements from Germany, France, Spain and Britain came as the U.N. Security Council was meeting at Washington's request to discuss the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. The United States is among nearly two dozen countries that recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim leader in recent days, after Maduro was sworn in for a second term following elections riddled with fraud.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The Latest on the political crisis in Venezuela (all times local): 10:55 a.m. The European Union as a whole says it could recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezeula's leader if the government doesn't announce new elections within the coming days. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement Saturday that the European bloc would intensify contacts with international partners "in the coming hours" on Venezuela's crisis. The EU urgently called for new elections, saying Venezuela's presidential vote last year was not democratic. Mogherini said "in the absence of an announcement on the organization of fresh elections with the necessary guarantees over the next days, the EU will take further actions, including on the issue of recognition of the country's leadership." Earlier Saturday, France, Germany, Britain and Spain set an eight-day deadline for calling electiondsfor recognizing Guaido's leadership. The Europeans' position opens a new front in their tensions with Russia, which strongly supports Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A military base deep inside Saudi Arabia appears to be testing and possibly manufacturing ballistic missiles, experts and satellite images suggest, evidence of the type of weapons program it has long criticized its archrival Iran for possessing. Further raising the stakes for any such program are comments by Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who said last year the kingdom wouldn't hesitate to develop nuclear weapons if Iran does. Ballistic missiles can carry nuclear warheads to targets thousands of kilometers (miles) away.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite my Italian roots, vengeance doesn't run deep in my veins. But I admit I smiled when Roger Stone's arrest was announced Friday morning. To give some context: On Oct. 7, 2016, WikiLeaks began leaking emails from my personal inbox that had been hacked by Russian intelligence operatives. A few days earlier, Stone - a longtime Republican operative and close confidante of then-candidate Donald Trump - had mysteriously predicted that the organization would reveal damaging information about the Clinton campaign. And weeks before that, he'd even tweeted: "Trust me, it will soon [be] Podesta's time in the barrel." Stone's connection with and boasting about WikiLeaks during the campaign has always been fishy.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — HBO's new film on newspaper columnists Jimmy Breslin and Pete Hamill romanticizes an era in New York and journalism that feels like a long, long time ago. The fact that it's very recent history makes "Breslin and Hamill: Deadline Artists" partly a tragedy. The two men embodied a time when New York was a rollicking and complicated place, and each lived for the streets and stories of the little guys who made the city run. Every city had their own Breslins or Hamills, who made the powerful tremble or shake their fists. Their newspapers were required reading.</description>
