      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FNC's Steve Hilton interviews Democratic presidential hopeful Marianne Williamson during her time at the Iowa State Fair. Williamson said democracy must be tended to like you would your body or your marriage. "You can't just assume that your democracy is okay because it was okay several decades ago. We are learning, and we are learning it the hard way, that our democracy must be tended to," Williamson said in an interview.  WILLIAMSON: The American revolution is an ongoing process. You can't say I was healthy in 1995 so I don't have to take care of my health anymore. You can't say my body was in shape in 2013 so I don't have to work out anymore. And it turns out, and we're experiencing it now. You can't just assume that your democracy is okay because it was okay several decades ago. We are learning, and we are learning it the hard way, that our democracy must be tended to. If you don't take care of your marriage, don't be surprised that you lose your marriage. If you don't take care of your business, don't be surprised if you lose your business. If you don't take care of your health, don't be surprised if you lose your health. And if you don't care and tend to your democracy, don't go being surprised when all these forces that would assault it are at the door. So it's the 11th hour, but it is not midnight yet.</description>

      <title>Municipalities nationwide grapple with bans on pet pigs...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Municipalities-nationwide-grapple-with-bans-on-14297855.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The knock on Dani Guill's door came in early May. It was a zoning compliance officer, there to investigate a complaint from a neighbor. Word was that a pig lived in her Virginia Beach, Virginia house, he told her.  He wasn't wrong. In fact, 3-year-old, 120-pound Pumpkin has her own bedroom and wardrobe. She loves Honey Nut Cheerios and acts grumpy when she doesn't get as much as she wants.  But unlike Guill's dog, Pumpkin is not allowed to reside in Virginia Beach. City law views her as livestock, though she is a potbellied pig bred to be a pet. Guill said the officer gave her 30 days to relocate the pig.  The eviction is now on hold as two city council members, at Guill's urging, draft a proposal to legalize Pumpkin and other pet pigs in the city. Guill said seven other owners have surfaced since she took up the cause. "Out of the woodwork, here come all the other pig parents," she said.  It's hardly an unusual municipal matter. Across the nation, pet pig owners are forcing cities and towns to grapple with the definition of swine and reassess zoning laws written in eras when the divide between pets and farm animals was far starker.  In the past year, pet pig legalization has been on the agenda in Holland, Michigan; Brookhaven, Georgia; and Chatfield, Minnesota - all of which decided to allow pigs. In Amherst, New York and Eureka Springs, Arkansas, officials did the opposite, upholding bans and calling for the ouster of outlaw pigs. Officials in other places are still mulling what to do.  "This is a growing concern. . . . It's hitting councils all over the country," said Mickey Schneider, a Eureka Springs alderwoman who pushed to change local law so that two potbellies in the Ozarks tourist town could stay. The animals have not been expelled, and Schneider said she's still trying. "These pigs are not stinky. And they are...</description>

      <title>Weather app alerts when about to rain, down to minute, all around world!</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/business/article/ClimaCell-weather-app-alerts-when-it-s-about-to-14297708.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if, wherever you're living, working or traveling, you could receive an alert before it's about to rain or snow and when the precipitation is about to end? And it's pretty accurate, too?  ClimaCell, a fledgling weather technology company based in Boston, released a mobile app Monday that provides notifications for exact locations in more than 50 countries. It promises "street-by-street, minute-by-minute short-term forecasts."  The app leverages the company's technology innovations, which are making waves in weather business industries.  ClimaCell, founded in 2015, has developed a global network of weather data that marries traditional observations of pressure, temperature, precipitation and wind with information drawn from wireless signals, satellites, connected cars, airplanes, street cameras, drones and other electronic sources. Millions of pieces of weather data can be derived from these technologies. It's what the company describes as the "weather of things."  This mix of data is fed into ClimaCell's forecast models, operated in Boulder, Colorado. The company created the NowCast model that gives highly specific, minute-by-minute forecasts out to six hours and a longer-term model, known as CBAM, that produces forecasts out to six days.  These models are designed to provide forecasts to help businesses solve problems in which "extra accuracy" is needed, according to Shimon Elkabetz, ClimaCell's chief executive.  Many of the weather companies operating today, spun up in the 1960s and 1970s, just take model forecasts from different governments, blend them and use statistical techniques to try to make them better. But ClimaCell is creating its forecasts from scratch.  Elkabetz said early results on its accuracy are promising. Compared with government forecasts, "we've...</description>

      <title>Dogfishing: Online daters pose with adorable pets that aren't theirs...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/article/Dogfishing-When-online-daters-pose-with-adorable-14297742.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Tinder, Avery Chuang developed a bad habit: She almost always swiped right on guys with a ridiculously adorable dog photo. It's not a high standard to go by, the 25-year-old in Elk Grove, California, admitted, but it helped her find men who are dog owners like herself - presuming that, of course, the featured pup is theirs.  She encountered her fair share of dog-baiters on dating apps (which she no longer uses since they are "addictive and demoralizing"). Most men were upfront in conversation with Chuang, but a few did slip through the cracks until she pieced it together.  There was a guy Chuang found attractive and charming and normal - until he turned around and questioned her for probing about his dog. And there was another who profusely apologized for displaying a friendly corgi that wasn't his (after she called him out) and then ghosted her.  Dogs, notably adorable photos of dogs, are a ubiquitous aspect of dating. They're convenient icebreakers on apps and on first dates. They add a nugget of personality to a profile. On Apple's App Store, Bumble features a photo of a bespectacled man cuddling a goldendoodle to insinuate how likable that is. There's also Dig, a new dating app specifically for dog owners.  This cultural obsession with dogs on the apps has spiraled into another problem: Daters are posting photos of pups they don't own, to attract matches. "Dogfishing" is not exactly a lie - the person did take a photo with that dog - but to some daters, it feels like a veiled form of deception. And things can get awkward fast when a date realizes that the pet in the profile solely exists as bait.  "That's the main thing: Stop borrowing dogs," said Erika Ettin, an online dating coach in Washington. She advises her clients to curate profiles representative of their actual life. "It's just odd when you're using...</description>
