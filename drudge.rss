      <title>Print money to pay for it?</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/822456/alexandria-ocasiocortez-wants-pay-green-new-deal-by-essentially-printing-more-money</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is back with another head-turning economic theory. The freshman congresswoman debuted her Green New Deal bill on Thursday, which aims to overhaul the U.S. economy and eliminate carbon emissions. Despite a slew of Democratic backers, NPR says the bill is unlikely to pass â€” especially with Ocasio-Cortez's current far-left proposal to pay for it all. Ocasio-Cortez's proposed 70 percent income tax on the mega-wealthy ended up being more popular than politicians and billionaires thought. But in a Thursday NPR interview, Ocasio-Cortez also declared we also have to "break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for 100 percent of government expenditure." She argued for a "combination of" taxes and deficit spending, essentially saying it's worth increasing the deficit if an idea might "actually pay for itself" through job creation later on, and that lawmakers could regulate inflation with strategic taxes down the line. Essentially, Ocasio-Cortez is continuing to argue for Modern Monetary Theory â€” something she said "absolutely" needs to be "a larger part of our conversation" in a recent Business Insider interview. The theory says that because governments can literally print money, "they can spend as much as they like," Politico explains. "Inflation is the only obstacle" that should stop the presses, The Week details here. In short, it's a big, untested idea for a big, untested plan.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — With Virginia's top three elected officials engulfed in scandal, fellow Democrats were rendered practically speechless, uncertain of how to thread their way through the racial and sexual allegations and their tangled political implications. Gov. Ralph Northam's career was already hanging by a thread over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook when a woman publicly accused the lieutenant governor of sexually assaulting her 15 years ago, and then the attorney general admitted that he too wore blackface once, as a teenager.</description>

She said it was a lesson in the Department of Homeland Security motto: "If you see something, say something." "I came in from a trip I'd been on and I spotted - it looked odd," McCain, co-chair of the governor's Arizona Human Trafficking Council and widow of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told KTAR News. "It was a woman of a different ethnicity than the child, this little toddler she had, and something didn't click with me. I tell people, trust your gut. I went over to the police and told them what I thought, and they went over and questioned her.</description>

(AP) — The political crisis in Virginia spun out of control Wednesday when the state's attorney general confessed to putting on blackface in the 1980s and a woman went public with detailed allegations of sexual assault against the lieutenant governor. With Gov. Ralph Northam's career already hanging by a thread over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook, the day's developments threatened to take down all three of Virginia's top elected officials, all of them Democrats.</description>

Watching from the sidelines, Sgt. Maj. Harold Sampson shakes his head. As a military intelligence specialist he spends a lot of time behind a desk. Over his two decades in the Army, he could easily pound out the situps, pushups and 2-mile run that for years have made up the service's fitness test.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lasting visual image from Tuesday night's State of the Union address was captured by photographer Doug Mills. It featured House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., applauding President Donald Trump in a way that can only be described as . . . withering? Pitying? Lucille Bluth-like in its contemptuousness? At his lectern, the president mentioned bipartisanship and turned to acknowledge Speaker Pelosi; she rewarded him by cocking her head, arching an eyebrow, and inventing, as comedian Patton Oswalt would put it online, a clap that somehow managed to be a profanity. Its power was in its restraint. Pelosi was not booing the president. She was acknowledging his words.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CUCUTA, Colombia (AP) — The Venezuelan military has barricaded a bridge at a key border crossing, issuing a challenge on Wednesday to a U.S.-backed effort by the opposition to bring humanitarian aid into the troubled nation. The Tienditas International Bridge was blocked a day prior by the Venezuelan National Guard with a giant orange tanker, two large blue containers and makeshift fencing near the border town of Cucuta, Colombian officials said. The bridge is at the same site where officials plan to store humanitarian aid that opposition leader Juan Guaido is vowing to deliver to Venezuela. The Trump administration has pledged $20 million in aid and Canada has promised another $53 million.</description>
