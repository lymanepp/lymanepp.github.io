      <title>TOP DOC: Virus 10 TIMES more lethal than flu...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/901470/coronavirus-10-times-more-lethal-than-seasonal-flu-trumps-task-force-immunologist-says</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told lawmakers during a House Oversight Committee hearing Wednesday that COVID-19 â€” the disease caused by the novel coronavirus â€” is probably about 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu. President Trump has often compared COVID-19 to the flu, which affects tens of thousands of Americans each year, in an effort to calm people down, but Fauci clearly wasn't trying to downplay the seriousness of the virus' spread. Fauci is a member of the White House's coronavirus task force. At the same time, he did clarify that 10 times figure actually brings the new coronavirus' fatality rate lower than official estimates, which hover around 3 percent. The flu has a mortality rate of about 0.1 percent, so, when considering the likelihood that there are many asymptomatic or very mild cases that have gone undiagnosed, Fauci places the new coronavirus' lethality rate at somewhere around 1 percent. While that's a good deal lower than the current data suggests, it still would lead to significant numbers of fatalities, and makes the flu comparisons seem pretty questionable. Tim O'Donnell Q: How does COVID-19 compare to other previous health situations â€” SARS, H1N1? Dr. Fauci: '...It is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu. I think that's something that people can get their arms around and understand.' pic.twitter.com/yjLrcFSOxR â€” Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) March 11, 2020</description>

      <title>New Italian lifestyle upends most basic routines and joys...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Italy-s-coronavirus-lockdown-upends-the-most-15119948.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ROME - Italy on Tuesday was a country in quiet emergency: little chatter, few hugs, few cars, no sports, empty piazzas, vacated restaurants and a deepening sense that a prolonged period of social isolation was the only way to slow the coronavirus.  The Italian government announced more than 10,000 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 631 deaths as of Tuesday evening. There were fewer new cases reported than in previous days, but the new figures show the largest single daily jump in deaths.  The government's historic ordering of a nationwide lockdown - limiting the movement of 60 million people - has transformed Italy into a testing ground for not only what it might take to control the virus, but how much a democracy is willing to upend life's most basic routines and joys.  In Rome on Tuesday, the city was moving at a crawl. People tele-worked or didn't work at all; they wore masks or wrapped scarves around their mouths; they kept a suspicious distance from others. They tried to drop the habits that seemed suddenly dangerous - the kiss greeting; the chat at the cafe counter - even as depression and deep financial pain seemed like unavoidable side-effects of the lockdown.  "I'm mostly sealed indoors," said Ivano Canni, 49, a newsstand owner, describing his sense, building for many other Italians as well, that any social contact carries a risk. "I'm trying to stand two meters apart from others. I open my door to let fresh air in for half an hour or so, then close it back."  Italy's initial response to the coronavirus outbreak had been to try to preserve normalcy and limit the economic sacrifices.

      <title>'10 days from our hospitals getting creamed'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/901251/trumps-former-pandemic-adviser-are-10-days-from-hospitals-getting-creamed</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus are swiftly ballooning across the United States, and President Trump's former Homeland Security Adviser Thomas Bossert says time is running out to control the spread. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who is overseeing one of the country's largest clusters, said 'if you do the math' there could be 64,000 cases of COVID-19 in the Evergreen State by May, while New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the positive cases in the city are 'coming in so intensely now' that public officials are struggling to keep up with them. He said he wasn't in a position to give the media a 'detailed case breakdown' because of the rapidly changing number. That seems to lend credence to Bossert's claim Tuesday that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed. Bossert tells NBC News just now: 'We are 10 days from our hospitals getting creamed.' https://t.co/qvqQSvGKXW â€” Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) March 10, 2020 Bossert, who in his old position coordinated the U.S. response to global pandemics (he was not replaced by Trump, who made cuts to national security), wrote an op-ed published Monday by The Washington Post saying the U.S. should take notes from places like Hong Kong and Singapore, which were able to level off their infection rate thanks to tougher measures early on.
