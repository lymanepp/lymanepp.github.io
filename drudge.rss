      <title>Washington-area residents say increased helicopter traffic is giving them nightmares...</title>
      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/Washington-area-residents-say-increased-14032067.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The helicopters typically come in threes.  As the first one flies by, the walls of Kathy Daniel's Bethesda, Maryland, home start to shake. When the second follows, the chains on the metal lamps in her living room begin jangling. The brass lamp her father brought home from the Bahamas goes "clink, clink, clink." The lamps with sailboat finials make a "boing, boing, boing" sound.  "Then the third one goes by, and at that point my nerves are rattled," said Daniel, 63, a retired communications expert who has lived in Bethesda for more than 30 years. "It's loud enough where I can't think straight. It makes my heart pound, actually - I can just feel my blood pressure going up."  The cacophony lasts at least three minutes and repeats over the course of the day. Helicopters fly over Daniel's home in the morning, about noon, in the evening and again late at night. Monday through Friday. The air traffic was not always this bad, Daniel said. As best she can estimate, it got much worse starting three or four years ago.  She is not alone. After a sharp spike in complaints from District of Columbia-area residents about the frequency and severity of helicopter noise, local lawmakers in January asked the Government Accountability Office to study the issue. Earlier this month, the GAO accepted the request and plans to launch the study this fall.  Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., one of the lawmakers who requested the study, said that helicopter noise is "our No. 1 constituent complaint" and that the number of complaints has risen steadily since he took office in 2015.  "Constituents are asking me why the episodes of helicopter noise are increasing, and I can't explain it, I don't know why," said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who also requested the GAO study. "The study should give us some answers about what is behind the increase in...</description>
