      <title>Behind Pence deference: Ambition...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Behind-Mike-Pence-s-deference-Ambition-15509715.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like many who served in Congress alongside the late John Lewis, then-Rep. Mike Pence made a pilgrimage to Selma, Ala., in 2010 to commemorate the 45th anniversary of "Bloody Sunday." He marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge just a few feet from Lewis as they retraced the historic route, and posed for a photo at the foot of the span - the Indiana Republican in crisp gray and the Georgia Democrat in somber black, their shoulders touching.  But when Lewis died last month of pancreatic cancer at 80, Pence, now vice president, held off on issuing a public comment on the civil rights hero's passing. President Donald Trump was no fan of the late congressman and openly complained about Lewis's refusal to attend his inauguration. Only after the White House distributed a perfunctory proclamation on the death in Trump's name did Pence feel comfortable releasing a statement of his own, memorializing Lewis as not just an "icon" but also "a colleague and a friend."  That hesitation - deferring to Trump for cues, and then following his lead - was classic Pence. It exemplified the well-honed subservience of a man who once governed his home state of Indiana but who as vice president has transformed himself into a loyal student and servant of Trump - binding his political ambitions to a mercurial and capricious boss now at risk of losing in November.  On Wednesday night, Pence will formally accept his party's nomination for a second term as vice president in an address to the Republican National Convention from Fort McHenry in Baltimore, where he will praise Trump's leadership. The keynote serves as a bookend of sorts for one of the few high-ranking officials to survive Trump's first term. He is being repaid for his loyalty with a reward - remaining in the No. 2 slot - that in most other administrations would never have been in...</description>

      <title>Falwell says wife had affair with 'pool boy'; Claims being blackmailed...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/933178/jerry-falwell-jr-says-wife-affair-florida-pool-boy-claims-being-blackmailed</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suspended Liberty University leader Jerry Falwell Jr. confirmed to Washington Examiner columnist Paul Bedard late Sunday that his wife, Becki Falwell, had an affair with a young man they befriended and went into business with in Florida eight years ago. In a long statement, Falwell said he and his wife 'forgave each other' â€” he suggested he had also 'important smaller things' to atone for, quoting a Bible verse about visual adultery â€” and had decided to come forward because his wife's former lover had been extorting them for 'huge amounts of monies' to stay quiet. 'I'm just tired of it,' Falwell told Bedard. Falwell said the young man â€” Giancarlo Granda â€” had created a ''fatal attractionâ€™ type situation,' referring to a famous 1987 movie in which a jilted extramarital lover boiled a pet rabbit, among other acts of retaliatory intimidation. Granda, 21 at the time of the affair, told the Examiner in an email that 'any allegation of extortion' is false, 'defamatory, and belied by clear documentary evidence,' adding that the attempt by the Falwells 'to sandbag me' with this 'last-minute story' just 'reeks of desperation,' and 'the WHOLE truth will come out.' The salacious nature of the relationship between the Falwells and Granda emerged when Michael Cohen, the former fixer and lawyer for President Trump, told comedian Tom Arnold in a secretly taped conversation that he had destroyed riquÃ© 'personalâ€� photographs involving the 'pool boy' on behalf of Falwell weeks before Falwell unexpectedly endorsed Trump for president. Falwell said Sunday he 'was not involved' in his wife's 'inappropriate personal relationship' with Granda, and mentioned 'fantastic' and 'prurient, untrue aspects' of the relationship 'based on the individual's misrepresentations.' Liberty University, a conservative evangelical Christian college founded by Jerry Falwell Sr., confirmed Friday that Falwell has been placed on indefinite paid suspension while the university investigates 'various rumors and claims' about him and decides if he will be fired. He makes about $1 million a year as president of Liberty University, The News &amp; Advance reports. Falwell, 58, has been on leave since apologizing for posting (then deleting) a photo of himself with his arm around a woman, both their pants partially unzipped, at a 'Trailer Park Boys' costume party on a 164-foot, six-bedroom yacht owned by NASCAR mogul Rick Hendrick. Falwell's family has reportedly been taking family vacations on the yacht since Liberty University signed a multi-million-dollar sponsorship deal with Hendrick Motorsports. Peter Weber</description>

      <title>WHITE HOUSE:  WHATEVER...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/White-House-Trump-s-campaign-dismiss-recording-15508761.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The White House and the Trump campaign on Sunday dismissed secretly recorded audio in which Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry said the president has "no principles" and "you can't trust him."  Mary Trump, the president's niece, surreptitiously taped the 15 hours of face-to-face conversations with Barry in 2018 and 2019. She provided The Washington Post with previously unreleased transcripts and audio excerpts.  In an interview Sunday on ABC News's "This Week," White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Trump "has been public with his response - you know, just another day and another attack that we continue to see."  "I can tell you that I've never met the judge," Meadows said of Maryanne Trump, who retired last year from her job as a federal judge. "I was at the funeral the other day. I was hoping to meet her there. She didn't show up for her brother's funeral."  The president's brother Robert died Aug. 15 at age 71. A private memorial service was held at the White House on Friday.  In one of the secretly recorded conversations, Barry, 83, appeared aghast at how her 74-year-old brother operated as president. "His goddamned tweet and lying, oh my God," she said. "I'm talking too freely, but you know. The change of stories. The lack of preparation. The lying. Holy s---."  Meadows pushed back against that criticism Sunday while criticizing Mary Trump, who he said was "written out of a will" and "has an ax to grind because she wants Joe Biden to be president."  "The president that I have the privilege of serving is not the one that's being described on a 15-hour . . . secret tape," Meadows said. "I mean, what family member tapes another family member for 15 hours secretly?"  In 1999, when family patriarch Fred Trump Sr. died, Barry joined with Donald and Robert...</description>

      <title>TRUMP: 'DEEP STATE' DELAYING VAX</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pushing for breakthroughs in treatments for the coronavirus, White House officials suggested Sunday there were politically motivated delays by the Food and Drug Administration in approving a vaccine and therapeutics for the disease. The accusations, the latest assault from President Donald Trump’s team on the so-called “deep state” bureaucracy, were presented without evidence and just hours before Trump was set to hold a news conference to announce an apparent advancement in therapeutics. “This president is about cutting red tape,” said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.</description>

      <title>Senator to supporters: How about skipping a meal to donate?</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/McSally-to-supporters-How-about-skipping-a-meal-15507664.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHOENIX (AP) - Sen. Martha McSally has suggested that supporters could "fast a meal" to donate to the Arizona Republican's campaign as she fights to fend off a tough challenge from Democrat Mark Kelly.  McSally made the request at a recent event in northern Arizona where she said her campaign needs financial help to counter advertising by Kelly and groups supporting the former astronaut's campaign, azfamily.com reported.  "We're doing our part to catch up, you know, to get our message out," McSally said. "But it takes resources. So, anybody can give, I'm not ashamed to ask, to invest. If you can give a dollar, five dollars, if you can fast a meal and give what that would be."  The remark drew critical attention on social media, while McSally's campaign said the candidate was just joking about skipping a meal.  "This is a dumb, non-story about a candidate," Caroline Anderegg, a McSally campaign spokeswoman, told the Arizona Republic. "It is frankly sad and disgusting that the Dems and the Kelly campaign are launching a misleading character assassination on Martha McSally, who would literally give the shirt off her back for anyone."  Republican businesswoman Christine Jones, who ran for Arizona governor in 2014 and Congress in 2016, called McSally's fundraising pitch "unconventional."  "I haven't talked to (McSally) about it, so I can't really opine on the specifics. But it does feel like its a little bit of an act of desperation," Jones said.  McSally trails Kelly in recent polls by anywhere from 5 to 11 percentage points, according to realclearpolitics.com.</description>
