      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DESTIN, Florida (AP) — When Polly Varnado's 9-year-old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, it didn't take long for the family to hear about insulin pumps. In September 2012, the girl picked out a purple one — her favorite color. Over the next seven months, she proceeded to be hospitalized four times in a McComb, Mississippi medical center with high blood sugar. But when Varnado asked about all her daughter's problems, she said, her doctor blamed user error. "They said it wasn't the insulin pump, it was my daughter," said Varnado, who became a registered nurse so that she could better care for the girl.</description>
