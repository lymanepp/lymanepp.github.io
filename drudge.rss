      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — As people peer into DNA for clues to health and heritage, man's best friend is under the microscope, too. Genetic testing for dogs has surged in recent years, fueled by companies that echo popular at-home tests for humans, offering a deep dive into a pet's genes with the swab of a canine cheek. More than a million dogs have been tested in little over a decade. The tests' rise has stirred debate about standards, interpretation and limitations. But to many dog owners, DNA is a way to get to know their companions better.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The Norwegian Intelligence Service says GPS signal disruption as seen during major NATO drills in Norway last year "is of particular concern" for the military and "is also a threat to civil aviation in peacetime." The intelligence agency said Monday in its annual report that the signal jamming "represents not only a new challenge" for NATO members, but saying Russia's ability to projects its power "in peace, crisis and war will increase." Norway and Finland have protested against the incident during NATO's Trident Juncture drills between Oct. 25 and Nov. 7, with Oslo saying Russian forces on the Arctic Kola peninsula were behind the GPS interference. Moscow denies any involvement.</description>
