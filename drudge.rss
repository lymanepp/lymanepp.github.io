      <title>BOLTON CLIFFHANGER</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Will-John-Bolton-testify-at-Trump-impeachment-14974182.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGON - The House is about to send President Donald Trump's impeachment over to the Senate, setting the stage for a high-profile showdown over just what kind of trial we'll see. And perhaps the biggest looming question is: Will John Bolton testify?  That question is starting to come into focus. The idea that Senate will quickly dismiss the impeachment articles and move on, as Trump has suggested, apparently isn't going to happen - which that means we can now turn to other matters like Bolton.  Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, this week became the first to directly indicate he supports Trump's former national security adviser testifying and would likely vote in favor of it. And despite declining to insist on Bolton's testimony as part of the trial's initial rules, two others appear amenable to voting for witnesses like Bolton during the trial. But that would still leave the vote deadlocked at 50-50, with one more GOP senator needed to put Bolton - and other witnesses Democrats desire, like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney - on the stand.  In other words: It's on a knife's edge.  Romney has previously indicated he wants to hear from Bolton, who resisted testifying to the House but says he would in a Senate trial. But now Romney has further clarified (with some wiggle room) that he would likely vote in favor of it.  "I presume I'll be voting in favor of hearing from John Bolton, perhaps among others," Romney said. "That could change depending on what happens in the ensuing days and during those arguments."  The two other most likely crossover votes - Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, - have been even more coy. But they have been working behind the scenes to make sure there will be votes on witnesses.  Murkowski also says in a new interview...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashley Barno was in a boarding area at San Diego International Airport, awaiting a Chicago-bound flight, when a message from an unfamiliar number flashed across her phone, saying hello and asking how she was doing.  The person then added, "Btw I must tell you that you are gorgeous!"  Barno thanked the sender for the flattery and asked again for his name. How had he gotten her number, she asked, and why was he texting her?  "You guess!!" he told her, adding that he worked for American Airlines, which was operating the flight Barno was waiting to board.  "I just saw you at the airport again!" he wrote, telling her in a later message: "you are looking very gorgeous in grey top today!!"  Barno, clad in a gray shirt, looked around the gate area, glancing over her shoulder. She was scared.  The disturbing encounter, which occurred in April and unfolded over more than 100 text messages that were later shared with The Washington Post, spurred a lawsuit against the airline and its employee over allegations of negligent hiring, sexual harassment and stalking. The interaction has left Barno reeling more than eight months later, nervous when she travels and sometimes fearful she's being watched, her attorney, Joseph Samo, said in an interview.  American Airlines did not answer specific questions about the allegations or the case, but company spokesman Joshua Freed said in a statement that, "The employee involved in the complaint is no longer employed at American Airlines."  "American Airlines takes the privacy and safety of our customers seriously. We investigated the allegations and took appropriate action," Freed said.  The person was not on duty at the time, he said.  The messages continued even after Barno got on the plane.  "This is weird," she wrote to him.  Then she learned he was on...</description>
