      <title>Tucker Carlson airs more leaked tapes of Cohen's secret CNN conversations...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/What-s-up-with-Tucker-Carlson-s-leaked-tapes-of-15558076.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the last two weeks, viewers of Tucker Carlson's Fox News opinion show have been treated to what his news colleagues might consider a significant scoop: leaked audio recordings of CNN heavyweights, including anchor Chris Cuomo and President Jeff Zucker, speaking candidly with former Trump fixer Michael Cohen.  Cohen has said publicly that he does not know how the recordings made their way into Carlson's hands. On Twitter, he stated that the only people who possess the tapes beside himself are President Donald Trump, the Trump Organization and the Department of Justice, adding that "I did not give this recording or authorization for its use to @FoxNews or anyone." (A Fox News spokesperson said that the network does not reveal its sources.)  While the origin of the tapes is still shrouded in mystery, what's clear is that Carlson has relished the chance to use them to bash CNN over the head, part of a long-running - and seemly intensifying - war with the network that once employed him. And if it seems like a curious diversion for a political pundit during a busy election season, Carlson's CNN fixation broadly aligns with the Trump campaign's media-bashing strategy.  CNN has declined to comment on the content of the tape recordings. Network officials see the tapes as part of a concerted effort by Trump-boosting conservatives to attack critics of the president and have chosen not to engage with any of the drip-drip revelations. (Conservative consultant Arthur Schwartz, who has described himself as "basically a [expletive] troll on Twitter," has heavily promoted the leaks on social media.)  The release of the tapes seems timed to undermine the rollout of Cohen's tell-all book, "Disloyal," which has brought the onetime press antagonist to MSNBC and Don Lemon's CNN show for promotional interviews.  After teasing the tapes on...</description>

During the two racially segregated "cafes," the groups were encouraged to "discuss their experience as students on campus." The university now says that it "sincerely regrets" describing the cafes as "Non-POC" and "BIPOC" events.</description>

      <title>With no contact and substantial space, Getaway's tiny houses were ahead of their time...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/travel/article/With-no-contact-and-substantial-space-Getaway-s-15559310.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Getaway, the tiny houses are separated by at least six times the recommended amount of social distancing space. Check-in is contactless, and all communication with the staff is conducted by text or phone. There are no communal facilities, and the amenities are within maskless reach. I could satisfy my hankering for, say, s'mores and "Walden" by the fire without leaving my protective bubble. Most important, I would be exposed to more spiders than people - an advantage during a pandemic.  "Getaway is naturally about socially distancing," said Jon Staff, who founded the company with his Harvard pal, Pete Davis. "No part of the business was about hanging out with other people."  The mod cabins are built for our current reality, even though they date from a simpler time: 2015. Staff and Davis, who has since left the company, created the retreat for overworked urbanites tethered to technology. Turns out the pro-nature, anti-social model is a perfect fit for a global health crisis, too.  While hotels struggle to recover - occupancy rates are still under 50% - Getaway is thriving. The company, which operates the cabins at 12 locations in nine states, reported a 99% occupancy rate in July and August and a 260% spike in bookings from May through July. Most of the outposts are more than 90% full through October; the Shenandoah Valley property, where I recently stayed, is at 99.8%.  The Getaway colonies are no more than a two-hour drive from such major urban centers as D.C., New York, Dallas and Los Angeles - a common round-trip commute for many city folk. Each property contains about 30 to 50 structures on double-digit acres of sylvan land. The company plans to open No. 13, in New York's Adirondacks, by the end of this year as well as expand some outposts. For example, the Virginia property will unveil nine two-person cabins...</description>

      <title>Spiking cases, falling oil prices deliver dual blow to NDakota...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/business/article/Spiking-coronavirus-cases-and-falling-oil-prices-15559140.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A recent surge in coronavirus cases is rekindling economic anxieties in North Dakota, where wildly fluctuating oil prices and recent drops in production threaten to leave the state's finances in fresh disarray.  Six months after it registered its first confirmed infection, roughly 80% of North Dakota's drilling rigs remain offline and thousands of local workers are still out of a job, cutting deeply into the state's ability to refine oil and mine hundreds of millions of dollars from the natural resources that flow deep within its borders.  For months, low oil prices have contributed to the slowdown, as a global decline in demand made it financially unfeasible for refiners in North Dakota to continue tapping new wells. Another blow came Tuesday: an unexpected 7.6% dip in U.S. benchmark prices that sent economic shock waves worldwide.  The fluctuations could not have come at a worse time for North Dakota, which has also emerged as one of the country's most concerning coronavirus hot spots, with a nation-leading 34 confirmed cases per 100,000 residents, according to a Washington Post analysis of state data.  The dual economic and epidemiological shock now facing the state has created new uncertainty for its residents, workers, businesses and government leaders, some of whom once seemed optimistic that they had weathered the worst of the pandemic.  "The onset of [coronavirus] and the complete crushing of the world demand for oil had a very dramatic effect, one frankly we've never seen before," said Ron Ness, the president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council.  A history of austerity and recent efforts to diversity its economy mean North Dakota may not be the worst-off among states reeling from the pandemic even as its infections climb. But its struggles illustrate the wide-ranging nature of the worst U.S. economic crisis...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Republican-worries-rise-as-Trump-campaign-pulls-15558399.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Fearing a coming cash crunch, President Donald Trump's campaign has pulled back from television advertising over the last month, ceding to Democratic nominee Joe Biden a huge advantage in key states and sparking disagreements over strategy among the president's senior team.  Republican officials have been inundated with calls from worried activists and donors who complain about constant Biden ads in their local media markets, with very few paid Trump responses, according to people familiar with the conversations. Some Republicans close to Trump have been baffled at the decision to sharply curb advertising and have told the president he should change course.  The complaints have upended the dynamics that dominated much of the race so far. With less than eight weeks before Election Day, the once lean Biden campaign is flush with cash, while the massive Trump operation is facing tough budgetary decisions down the stretch that have increased tensions around the president.  Among those worried is Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, who recently told the president she was concerned his ads were not on television in states such as Michigan and Florida where Biden was blanketing the airwaves, according to people familiar with the conversation. The president shared the concern, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.  The decision to slash spending has been ordered by Trump's new campaign manager, Bill Stepien, who has been restructuring the budget since taking over the campaign operation in July, after it had already spent nearly $1 billion.  Stepien has told others that cutting the ad budget was necessary because it was impossible to cut other spending, such as staffing or a campaign headquarters. He has described facing difficult...</description>

      <title>Former officers charged in George Floyd killing turn blame on each other ...</title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Former-officers-charged-in-George-Floyd-killing-15558124.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MINNEAPOLIS - The four former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd's killing appear to be turning on each other, with each offering significantly different versions of the infamous arrest that acknowledge Floyd should not have been allowed to die that day but also deflect the blame to others.  The four men have said in court documents that they all thought someone else was in charge of the scene on May 25 - with rookie officers arguing they were deferring to a veteran, and the veteran saying he was simply assisting in an arrest that was in progress. All have said in court documents that the relationship between the veteran officer - Derek Chauvin - and the others is at the heart of the issue, as each officer perceived their role, and who was in charge, quite differently. Chauvin was the officer shown with his knee on Floyd's neck as he struggled to breathe in videos of the ill-fated arrest.  "There are very likely going to be antagonistic defenses presented at the trial," Earl Gray, a lawyer for Thomas Lane, wrote in a legal motion filed here this week. "It is plausible that all officers have a different version of what happened and officers place blame on one another."  Gray and lawyers for Chauvin, Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao have been arguing to separate the former officers' cases for purposes of trial, citing competing stories from their clients about the events that led to the 46-year-old Black man's death. The officers are scheduled to appear in court Friday as a judge takes up that question; prosecutors have been asking for a joint trial.  Minneapolis authorities are locking down the area around the courthouse because of planned protests Friday. Windows on government buildings have been boarded up and law enforcement officials are setting up a perimeter to keep protesters at a distance.  Floyd died...</description>

      <title>Bragged about protecting Saudi crown prince...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/936920/trump-bragged-woodward-about-protecting-saudi-crown-prince-after-khashoggi-killing-saved-ass</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump was seemingly happy the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi eventually faded from the spotlight. In fact, as Trump tells Bob Woodward, it was his doing. Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in late 2018, seemingly on the order of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. His disappearance sparked unified outrage, including from both sides of the aisle in Congress; Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), usually a staunch ally of Trump, led the charge to hold the crown prince responsible for Khashoggi's killing. But nearly two years later, not much has happened. As Trump tells Woodward in the veteran journalist's forthcoming book Rage, that's exactly what he wanted to happen, Business Insider reports via a copy of the book. 'I saved his ass,' Trump reportedly said of bin Salman in 2018. 'I was able to get Congress to leave him alone. I was able to get them to stop.' And in a conversation with Woodward in January of this year, Trump still declined to hold bin Salman accountable for the killing. 'He will always say that he didn't do it,' Trump told Woodward. So Woodward asked Trump if he believed bin Salman ordered the murder. 'No, he says that he didn't do it,' Trump continued. 'He says very strongly that he didn't do it,' before pivoting to discuss how Saudi Arabia spends billions of dollars on U.S. goods every year. Khashoggi was a Saudi journalist based in the U.S. He wrote for The Washington Post, and often criticized the Saudi government. He went to the consulate in 2018 to get documents for his upcoming marriage, and was likely killed not long after he went inside. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
