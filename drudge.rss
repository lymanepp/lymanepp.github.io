      <title>Maryland dog park divides rich and powerful...</title>
      <link>https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Maryland-dog-park-divides-the-rich-and-powerful-14383917.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.houstonchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone knows there's a problem with Chubbs. Dirt is smeared across his face. His tongue is rolling out of his mouth. He's surrounded by signs that say "NO EXCESSIVE BARKING." But the 5-month-old golden retriever does not know how to read. At a dog park in one of Maryland's wealthiest suburbs, he spends this sunny August morning rolling on his back. He opens his mouth, and then, he does it. He woofs. Twice. "CHUBBS!" four humans around him yell, trying to stop him from doing what dogs do - just not in Chevy Chase Village this summer. Here in this community of the rich and powerful, where the average household income is $460,000, barking is the subject of a ferocious (fur-ocious?) debate - one that has divided the two-legged one-percenters for nearly a year. The drama began last fall when the village spent $134,000 to turn a muddy triangle of land into a park where pups could run off-leash in a fenced refuge. Chase tennis balls. Sniff one another's butts. But after about a month, signs decrying the barking of those dogs began appearing around the park. The village police started receiving almost daily calls about the noise, mostly from one particular neighbor whose house backs up to the park. By spring, the tension had escalated so much that the Chevy Chase Village Board of Managers called a public hearing. Then another in June. And another in July. At the center of it all is Elissa Leonard, chair of the village board and wife to Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve. In recent months, her husband has been under attack from President Donald Trump, who appointed him but blames him for the tanking stock market. "My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?" the president tweeted Friday. Leonard, meanwhile, is on the receiving end of...</description>
