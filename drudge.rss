      <title>COSTA:  Some Republicans remain skeptical of pandemic...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Some-in-GOP-remain-skeptical-of-coronavirus-15137350.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the weekend, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., a leading ally of President Donald Trump, dismissed concerns about the novel coronavirus pandemic and said on Fox News that "it's a great time to just go out, go to a local restaurant."  And former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, a Trump supporter who was pardoned last month, tweeted that "this hysteria is being created to destabilize the country and destroy" Trump.  But from Italy, where there is a national quarantine to try to slow the devastating effects of the coronavirus, Newt Gingrich offered a different perspective. The former House speaker wrote an opinion piece seeking to convince his fellow Republicans that not only was the pandemic very real, it required urgent action.  Inside the Republican Party and the conservative movement that Trump commands, there is now a deep divide as the nation confronts the coronavirus. For weeks, many on the right, including Trump, minimized the virus, if they considered it at all. Even in recent days, as much of the world shuts down to try to stop its spread, some Republicans mocked what they saw as a media-generated frenzy.  Their reaction reflected how the American right has evolved under Trump, moving from a bloc of small-government advocates to a grievance coalition highly skeptical of government, science, the news and federal warnings.  Their conspiratorial unrest is particularly acute within right-wing media, where Fox Business removed a prime-time anchor for casting the coronavirus as "another attempt to impeach the president." Other right-wing personalities continue to call the coronavirus a "hoax" or falsely blame George Soros, the billionaire investor and liberal donor, for causing it.  But conservatives and Republicans now face an undeniable reality as the pandemic's death count here and abroad climbs - and...</description>
