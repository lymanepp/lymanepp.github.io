      <title>Russia readying S-400 missiles for Turkey amid warnings of U.S. sanctions on NATO ally...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Russia-confirms-plans-to-send-S-400-anti-aircraft-14073552.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOSCOW - Russia will deliver its S-400 air-defense missile system to NATO-member Turkey in the coming days, a Kremlin spokesman said Friday, in a deal likely to trigger U.S. sanctions and test the bonds of the Western military alliance.  But the scope of the possible response from Washington remains clouded by apparent conflicting messages.  President Donald Trump has publicly shown sympathy for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's position on the Russian missile purchase. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, has warned of tough measures that could include canceling the sales of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey.  For the wider NATO alliance, the Turkish deal strikes at the heart of military coordination. NATO has expressed worry that the S-400 is incompatible with its possession of the U.S.-made F-35s, and would give Russia access to secrets of its stealth technology.  For more than a year, the United States has urged Erdogan not to procure the sophisticated Russian air-defense system - a move that would bring mandatory U.S. sanctions against Turkey under a 2017 law on cooperation with "adversaries."  The U.S. measures, if carried out, would cause an extraordinary breach in U.S.-Turkey relations and almost certainly complicate ongoing negotiations between the two countries over other issues, including military strategy in Syria.  But while U.S. officials have portrayed the sanctions against Turkey as a matter of certainty, Trump refrained from taking a hard line with Erdogan over the S-400s during talks last month at the Group of 20 summit in Japan.  Trump noted that Turkey help bring U.S. jobs by paying a "tremendous amount of money" on the F-35 fighters.  Trump, speaking to reporters at the summit, said Erdogan had first sought to buy Patriot missiles but had been...</description>

      <title>Activist at center of landmark case allowing flag burning faces charges after melee in front of White House...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Activist-at-center-of-landmark-case-allowing-flag-14074645.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Prosecutors in Washington on Friday dropped the most serious criminal charge filed against a California man whose burning of two American flags outside the White House on the Fourth of July sparked a melee between ideologically opposed groups.  Gregory Lee "Joey" Johnson, 62, of San Francisco, had faced a felony charge of assault on a police officer after two officers said they were doused with an accelerant from the burning flag that made them ill and sent them to a hospital for treatment. That charge was not pursued on Friday.  Johnson still faces other charges of inciting violence, disorderly conduct and violating the fire code, all misdemeanors.  "It was a righteous thing to do in the face of a fascist regime," Johnson said Friday outside D.C. Superior Court after being freed until his next hearing Aug. 1. He was still wearing his group's black T-shirt with the slogan "Revolution - nothing less."  Johnson said he set two flags on fire Thursday afternoon as the city was busy with residents and tourists who had come to President Donald Trump's controversial "Salute to America" Fourth of July celebration. After the first was extinguished by opponents, another flag fire occurred moments later in front of a uniformed officer for the U.S. Secret Service.  "The flag is a symbol of empire and oppression," Johnson said.  Johnson is a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, also espouses the slogan "imagine a world without America," and he has made burning flags an integral part of his protest. It was Johnson's burning of an American flag during a march against nuclear war in Dallas in 1984 that led to a landmark 1989 Supreme Court decision overturning his conviction for "desecration of a venerated object" and making flag burning a constitutionally protected...</description>
