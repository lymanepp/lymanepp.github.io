      <title>Warren embraced high-dollar fundraiser circuit for years -- until just before her presidential campaign...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Warren-embraced-the-high-dollar-fundraiser-14929335.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chase Williams grinned broadly as he stood for a photo next to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, chatting briefly with the Massachusetts Democrat before moving on so someone else could have their turn.  It was the kind of moment that has become a ubiquitous part of Warren's presidential campaign and its long "selfie lines," where supporters wait for hours to pose with her at no charge.  But this shot, taken in October 2017, was at an entirely different kind of event: an exclusive "backstage" reception that took place in the vault of a former Cleveland bank. And that was the day's low-rent affair - donors who agreed to pay more attended an even more exclusive shindig with Warren that day, according to two people familiar with her schedule.  The events were part of a high-dollar fundraising program that Warren had embraced her entire political career, from her first Senate run in 2011 through her reelection last year. Warren was so successful at it that she was able to transfer $10 million of her Senate cash to help launch her presidential bid.  But in the past year Warren has undergone a transformation, moving from one of the Democratic Party's biggest draws at high-dollar fundraisers to a presidential candidate who has sworn them off as sinister attempts to sell access.  In a debate last week, Warren criticized rival Pete Buttigieg for having an exclusive fundraiser in a crystal-filled wine cave in Napa Valley, prompting the South Bend, Indiana, mayor to respond that she shouldn't issue "purity tests you cannot yourself pass."  Williams, who supports Buttigieg in the presidential race, said Warren's position was "disingenuous."  "I am frustrated because she said, 'I don't do this. This isn't something I do.' And two years ago she very much did do that, and I was in the room," said...</description>

      <title>ABERNATHY:  In age of Trump, it's OK to be [deeply] conflicted... </title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/opinion/article/In-the-age-of-Trump-it-s-OK-to-be-deeply-14928014.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HILLSBORO, Ohio - Considering recent reports chronicling the decline of Christianity in the United States, the level of outrage expressed over President Donald Trump's offhand comment that the late congressman John Dingell, D-Mich., might be "looking up," presumably from hell, is somewhat surprising. Suddenly, at least for a day or two, everybody got religion.  To be fair, Trump first suggested that Dingell was "looking down" from heaven. But the president couldn't resist his little joke, and the resulting anguish it caused Rep. Debbie Dingell, the congressman's widow, was entirely understandable. Trump should apologize.  He won't, of course. Not that Trump's lack of contrition will cost him any support. The president's devotees long ago accepted his callousness as a character flaw that is offset by his frontal assault on a corrupt and complacent Washington swamp. The local Republican Party county chair told me last week she had just returned from Dayton, where the printer claims to be working around the clock to keep up with the demand for Trump fliers, pamphlets and memorabilia. There is no abatement in enthusiasm, he told her.  The blowback from the pundit class over Trump's musings on the fate of someone's eternal soul would be more meaningful if the same empathy was accorded the president when it is predicted that he will burn in hell. Such insinuations are regularly made, and similar hopes expressed in emails I receive. There are even fine art prints of "Trump's Arrival in Hell" available online ($30 unframed), but widespread disgust over such an affront to our president has yet to be observed.  Despite the Bible's observation that the path to heaven is narrow and few will travel it, while the road to hell is wide and much more populated, it is still improper in polite society to suggest that anyone will end up in...</description>
