      <title>THE CONWAY SHOW HOLIDAY SPECIAL: George savages 'IMPOTUS'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/885524/george-conway-savage-new-nickname-postimpeachment-trump</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump spent a good deal of Thursday angrily tweeting about being impeached by the House and â€” in a move that appears to have him especially enraged â€” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to sit on the articles of impeachment for a bit before sending them to the Senate. Trump is 'mad as hell' and 'demanding his day in court,' Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) reported Thursday evening. Trump has no control over Pelosi's decision. So what do you call a person who holds the most powerful office in the world, stewing over his inability to influence a coequal branch of government that just accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors? George Conway has an idea. IMPOTUS (IMpeached President Of The United States) @realDonaldTrump is accusing @SpeakerPelosi of political malpractice. I donâ€™t think so. #IMPOTUS https://t.co/a4WoLJgaqr â€” George Conway (@gtconway3d) December 20, 2019 Trump is a nickname aficionado, but he probably won't appreciate IMPOTUS, especially coming from a conservative critic who happens to be married to one of his senior advisers. Impotent has two interlinked meanings: The inability to take effective action, or powerlessness; and a quasi-medical condition that requires drugs like Cialis and Viagra. Let's assume Conway is referring to the former. Peter Weber</description>

It’s untenable that it has 42 separate public pension schemes — one for train drivers, another for opera singers, and so on. It’s untenable that the French think</description>

      <title>Winners and losers... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Winners-and-losers-from-the-November-Democratic-14851164.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Democratic presidential candidates momentarily sidelined the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday night, when they met in Atlanta for the November MSNBC-Washington Post debate.  Below are some winners and losers.  Winners  Pete Buttigieg: Buttigieg has been good in the debates, and now he's got real momentum in the first contest in Iowa, where a Des Moines Register-CNN poll showed him up nine points there last week. The question has been how he would handled the newfound pressure - and answer questions about whether a young, small-town mayor has the gravitas to win the presidency. "We need somebody who can go toe-to-toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that [Donald Trump has] been appealing to," he said, adding: "I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small. But frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small." On a night he seemed likely to be the target of many rivals' attacks his most tense back-and-forth was with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. That's about the best he could have hoped for, given her limited constituency in the Democratic Party.  Amy Klobuchar: She's shown perhaps less momentum in Iowa, but she's rising slightly. And in a key moment, she turned what could have been a dicey question - about her suggestion that a woman with Buttigieg's experience wouldn't make the debate stage - into a crowd-pleasing response about a female president. She said Buttigieg was qualified, but, "Women are held to a higher standard; otherwise, we could play a game called Name Your Favorite Woman president." Then she brought the house down with this: "If you think a woman can't beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."  Marijuana: It took most of the debate, but Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., ultimately seized upon an issue that...</description>

      <title>He's most-attacked candidate onstage... </title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/885475/final-democratic-debate-2019-all-about-pete-buttigieg</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's no 'I' in team â€” but there are a few in 'Buttigieg.' The final Democratic debate of 2019 was largely about South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, as he racked up nearly 20 minutes of speaking time and found himself at the forefront of several squabbles. Buttigieg was attacked more than any other Democratic candidate, fielding at least nine callouts during the three-hour debate, according to NBC News. But Buttigieg didn't just play victim â€” he also went on the offensive 17 times. That's more than any other candidate, save for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who made 24 attacks. Buttigieg's name was invoked throughout the evening, including in a particularly testy exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on the subject of his wine cave fundraiser. The two candidates also sparred over tuition assistance and, more broadly, campaign finance. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) wasted no opportunity to go after her fellow moderate on the debate stage, first calling out Buttigieg for parroting 'talking points' and then raising concerns over his experience and electability. But Buttigieg should rest easy knowing there was at least one other non-Democratic candidate who was attacked more than him: President Trump. Marianne Dodson</description>
