      <title>'HOPELESS': Republican Gov. rips Trump's virus response in scathing letter...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/925865/marylands-gop-governor-publishes-scathing-indictment-trumps-coronavirus-response</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can apparently count Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) among the solid majority of Americans who are unimpressed with President Trump's COVID-19 response. In a brutal Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, for example, 62 percent of registered voters said Trump is hurting the effort to fight COVID-19, while 67 percent said they don't trust the information he shares about the disease. Unlike most Americans, though, Hogan has a front-row seat to Trump's response, both as a governor and chairman of the National Governors Association. Hogan published a detailed, withering critique of Trump's response in an op-ed Thursday in Trump's least-favorite newspaper, The Washington Post. He started with the extraordinary effort he and his Korean-born wife, Yumi Hogan, made to fly 500,000 COVID-19 tests in from South Korea in April, sending them into safe hiding under armed guard because 'the federal government had recently seized 3 million N95 masks purchased by Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker.' This airlift from Seoul 'shouldn't have been necessary,' Hogan writes, but 'I'd watched as the president downplayed the outbreak's severity and as the White House failed to issue public warnings, draw up a 50-state strategy, or dispatch medical gear or lifesaving ventilators from the national stockpile to American hospitals. Eventually, it was clear that waiting around for the president to run the nation's response was hopeless.' Dr. Anthony Fauci and other federal health experts gave a dire, 'unfiltered,' and prescient briefing to Americans governors in early February, Hogan writes, and 'it was jarring, the huge contrast between the experts' warnings and the president's public dismissals' He detailed things Trump did and said, and more importantly, the things he did not do. 'Governors always do the hard work, make the tough decisions and take the political heat,' Hogan writes. 'But an undertaking as large as a national testing program required Washington's help. We expected something more than constant heckling from the man who was supposed to be our leader. Trump soon disabused us of that expectation.' Read the essay at The Washington Post.

      <title>MARY: USA has devolved into version of her 'incredibly dysfunctional family'...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Mary-Trump-says-the-U-S-has-devolved-into-a-15412603.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary Trump, President Donald Trump's niece, said that watching the country's leadership devolve into "a macro version of my incredibly dysfunctional family" was one of the factors that compelled her to write her book, "Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man."  In an interview Wednesday with The Washington Post, Mary Trump said she blames "almost 100%" her grandfather, Fred Trump -- the family patriarch whom she describes as a "sociopath" in her 214-page memoir of sorts -- for creating the conditions that led to Trump's rise and, ultimately, what she views as his dangerous presidency.  Much like in her extended family, Mary Trump said, a similar dynamic is now playing out on the national stage, with Trump simultaneously possessing "an unerring instinct for finding people who are weaker than he is," while also being "eminently usable by people who are stronger and savvier than he is" and eager to exploit him.  Her book -- which was published Tuesday and became an instant bestseller based on advance orders alone -- so worried her family that the president's brother unsuccessfully tried to block its publication in court. Unlike the bevy of other books critical of Trump, this is the only one written by a family member with firsthand knowledge of the Trump clan, and Mary Trump, who earned a doctoral degree in psychology, uses that background to analyze her uncle and his pathologies.  Assessing the current moment, in which Trump has amplified racism and stoked the flames of white grievance and resentment, Mary Trump said that the president is "clearly racist," but that his behavior stems from a combination of upbringing and political cynicism.  "It comes easily to him and he thinks it's going to score him points with the only people who are continuing to support him," she said.  Mary...</description>

      <title>Conservative alternative to TWITTER wants to be place for free speech for all; Rules still apply... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Conservative-alternative-to-Twitter-wants-to-be-15409996.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In late June, two days after Twitter put a fifth warning label on one of President Donald Trump's tweets, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted that he was joining Parler, calling it "a platform [that] gets what free speech is all about."  The social media site, which has been described as a conservative Twitter, is on a tear with people who say Twitter and Facebook are silencing conservative voices. In one week, it gained 1 million users, bringing its total to 2.8 million by early July.  Some of its most prominent users are part of the conservative establishment. Trump campaign director Brad Parscale is on Parler, as is Eric Trump, the president's son, and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Conservative commentator Dan Bongino announced in mid-June that he had taken an ownership stake in the company.  A crackdown by Twitter and, more reluctantly, Facebook, against messages from President Trump that the companies said violate their policies is fueling Parler's rise. Parler bills itself as a place for "free expression without violence and a lack of censorship," key words that many conservatives have picked up as a rallying cry to promote the app online.  Parler chief executive and co-founder John Matze said the app welcomes all voices. But the company appears to cater to a right-wing base fed up with what they view as censorship on traditional social media sites.  "We initially attracted conservative users because they felt disenfranchised by other social media platforms," Matze said in an email sent through a spokesperson.  But Parler is quickly discovering the limits of free expression. On June 30, Matze took to Parler to explain its house rules, apparently frustrated with some of Parler's new users testing the limits of its free-expression motto by posting...</description>

      <title>Postal Service braces for mail-in ballot issues...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Postal-Service-braces-for-mail-in-ballot-issues-15410083.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Postal workers found three tubs of uncounted absentee ballots the day after the Wisconsin primary. Some Ohioans did not receive their ballots in time for the election because of mail delays. And in Dallas, absentee ballots some voters sent to the county were returned just days before Election Day, with no explanation.  Problems caused by a spike in absentee voting during this year's primaries are serving as potential warning signs for the U.S. Postal Service, which is bracing for an expected onslaught of mail-in ballots this fall as states and cities push alternatives to in-person voting because of the pandemic.  The concern extends to local elections offices that may be unaccustomed to aspects of the mail, such as the time it takes for parcels to reach their destinations and how to design their ballots to meet postal standards.  So the Postal Service is regularly sending advice and checklists to thousands of elections officials. Local elections offices are hiring temporary workers to process absentee ballots, and some local elections boards are adding options for voters to do curbside drop-offs of their mail ballots on Election Day.  The Postal Service is also recommending that voters request their ballots at least 15 days before Election Day and mail their completed ballots at least one week before the due date.  "Voters: We all have the power to make it better in November," said Tammy Patrick, elections expert and senior adviser to the Democracy Fund, a bipartisan group. "Just because you can [wait until] the deadline, doesn't mean you should."  In a statement to The Washington Post, the Postal Service said it was working closely with state and local elections officials to head off problems in the fall.  "As we anticipate that many voters may choose to use the mail to...</description>
