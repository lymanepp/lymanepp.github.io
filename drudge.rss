      <title>'JOKER' JITTERS: VIOLENCE FEARS SIMMER...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/business/article/Police-theaters-brace-for-violence-as-Warner-14490003.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it prepared to roll out its new movie "Joker," Warner Bros. faced protests from the families of mass-shooting victims, pundit criticism that the film could inspire violence, a warning from a theater chain and even comments from its director that he was fueled by resentment for liberal Hollywood.  And that was before the New York Police Department decided to deploy undercover cops to screenings.  "Joker," the new Joaquin Phoenix movie about a marginalized middle-aged white man who finds salvation in violence, hits theaters Thursday night. For a modern film business that scrupulously avoids controversy - shunning ideological content in its scripts and coaching stars to avoid politics in interviews - the movie has become the most unusual of modern products: a lightning rod produced by a major studio.  "There's been so much controversy around it that I don't think anyone really knows what to expect," said Bruce Nash, a movie-release expert from the box-office site The Numbers.  That includes Warner Bros, which has been in a position of desperately trying to avoid headlines for a movie when news coverage typically is a sought-after commodity. Executives have been tasked with steering the release of the film to a country seething with anger and reeling from mass shootings.  A rare movie that makes a villain the hero, "Joker" centers on Arthur Fleck, a failed clown and standup comic with a neurological deficit who turns to mass murder after being marginalized. He eventually becomes The Joker, folk hero to an angry populist mob.  The politically charged backlash began even before the film debuted at the Venice Film Festival, where it landed one of the film world's top honors, the Golden Lion prize. Time Magazine's Stephanie Zacharek was among several critics questioning the...</description>
