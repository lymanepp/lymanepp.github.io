      <title>At fraternities, an alarming spike...</title>
      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/At-fraternities-an-alarming-spike-in-cases-15401579.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaders agonizing about whether, and how, to safely reopen colleges and universities this fall now have another worry: The frat house.  In recent weeks, as students have trickled back onto campus, public health officials have been warning about an alarming spike in coronavirus cases that appear related to fraternity housing and parties that had been a staple of the college experience.  With students often crammed into houses that were hard to police and regulate before the pandemic, public health officials say they believe major changes are needed to better protect the health of students and the broader community in college towns from coast to coast.  The concerns center on how easily the virus spreads during social gatherings - particularly those that are indoors. There is also skepticism about whether students in group housing will follow safety precautions, including eliminating roommates and communal dinners, and wearing masks.  "There's no doubt that this is a massive change, a massive transition for all of us," said Judson Horras, president and chief executive of the North American Interfraternity Conference, a fraternity membership organization representing 6,000 undergraduate chapters and 250,000 fraternity members. "It won't look like a normal fall this fall with social events."  In a sign of the growing concern, the leadership at the University of California at Berkeley sent an urgent appeal Wednesday to students, noting that the number of coronavirus cases on campus had more than doubled in just a week. The majority of cases have been traced back to fraternity or sorority social gatherings, UC-Berkeley University Health Services' medical director, Anna Harte, and assistant vice chancellor, Guy Nicolette, wrote in a letter to students.  "At the rate we are seeing...</description>

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Silicon-Valley-is-getting-tougher-on-Trump-and-15400050.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nation's technology industry has begun taking a harder line against hate speech, misinformation and posts that potentially incite violence when made by President Donald Trump and some of his most extreme supporters after years of treating such issues gingerly amid fear of triggering the wrath of the nation's most powerful politician.  The moves, such as labeling false posts by Trump and banishing forums devoted to supporting him after years of policy violations, have taken place across the industry in recent weeks, with actions by Twitter, Reddit, Snapchat, YouTube and the live-streaming platform Twitch.  Even Facebook, which long has given wide latitude in allowing problematic posts by Trump and his followers, on Wednesday closed down a network of more than 100 accounts and pages affiliated with Trump confidante and convicted felon Roger Stone. The action came years after his use of social media first came under the scrutiny of federal investigators and involved issues dating back to 2015 that the company said it had unearthed only recently.  Facebook and the other companies still are stopping well short of establishing the guard rails advocated by Democrats, civil rights groups and independent researchers who study online hate speech and misinformation. Twitter's recent refusal to impose sanctions against Trump for posting a video in which a supporter shouted "white power" underscores the awkward balancing act underway at many technology companies. Trump deleted the post after several hours and pleas from his senior staff. A source familiar with the discussion who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the topic said Twitter did not ask the White House to delete the Tweet.  But the newfound aggressiveness in tackling such issues, however belated and partial, may create a social media landscape...</description>

      <title>DEATHS CLIMB AGAIN...</title>
      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/Virus-s-daily-death-toll-is-on-the-rise-again-15400748.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The daily death toll from America's coronavirus crisis rose sharply this week amid a dramatic surge in confirmed infections across the South and West that has inundated hospitals with ill patients and forced several states to pause or reverse plans to reopen businesses.  Texas, Arizona and South Carolina have all seen their death tolls rise by more than 100 percent in the past four weeks, according to an analysis of state and county health data by The Washington Post. Four more states - Mississippi, Tennessee, California and Louisiana - have seen at least a 10 percent jump in that time span.  "They're starting to tick up," said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "Deaths are a lagging indicator, so we always expected that if they were going to go up, it would take some time."  After mid-April, the daily death toll declined as shutdown orders took effect across the country and the virus curve began to flatten. The low point came July 5, with 217 recorded coronavirus deaths, the lowest toll since March 24, when the pandemic was in its initial upswing.  Since then, amid record-breaking case numbers in several states, the death count has begun to rise, surpassing 800 deaths each of the past four days. Although still below the highs in April and May, when more than 2,000 people per day were regularly dying from the virus, experts warn that the trend could continue to get worse.  "This is just the early wave of a lot of suffering and death. The longer we wait to act aggressively, the harder it's going to be for us to get out of the tailspin," said Ashish Jha, who directs the Harvard Global Health Institute.  The spike in deaths this week remains a small sample.  Nuzzo said she and other public health experts prefer to make judgments...</description>

      <title>Calls mail-in ballots 'dishonest' but absentee ballots 'fine'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/924774/trump-calls-mailin-ballots-dishonest-but-says-absentee-ballots-are-fine-theyre-same-thing</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump's campaign against mail-in voting relies on a fundamental misunderstanding of what the process even is. Even amid a global pandemic that makes it dangerous to gather in public and definitely dangerous to vote in person, Trump has railed against the safer option of mass mail-in voting. He repeated his false claim that mail-in voting is wracked with fraud in a Friday tweet, but then decided 'absentee ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your voting privilege.' There's one big problem with that: Absentee and mail-in ballots are the same thing. ....Absentee Ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your voting privilege. Not so with Mail-Ins. Rigged Election!!! 20% fraudulent ballots? â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2020 Despite what Trump says, getting a ballot by mail â€” an absentee ballot, one might say â€” in most states requires filing an application complete with one's signature. Five states have all-mail elections and haven't faced any major issues or fraud throughout the years. Trump has made this inequivalence between absentee and mail-in voting many times in the past. He's often used it to justify why he has voted by mail many times in the past even when there was no global health threat keeping him from going to the polls. Administration officials have also tried to claim mail-in voting is problematic despite using the process several times themselves. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
