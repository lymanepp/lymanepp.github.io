      <title>TIKTOK teens, K-Pop fans take credit...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's campaign promised huge crowds at his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday, but it failed to deliver. Hundreds of teenage TikTok users and K-pop fans say they're at least partially responsible.  Brad Parscale, the chairman of Trump's re-election campaign, posted on Twitter on Monday that the campaign had fielded more than 1 million ticket requests, but reporters at the event noted the attendance was lower than expected. The campaign also canceled planned events outside the rally for an overflow crowd that did not materialize.  Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's spokesman, said protesters stopped supporters from entering the rally, held at the BOK Center, which has a 19,000-seat capacity. Reporters present said there were few protests.  TikTok users and fans of Korean pop music groups claimed to have registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets for Trump's rally as a prank. After @TeamTrump tweeted asking supporters to register for free tickets using their phones June 11, K-pop fan accounts began sharing the information with followers, encouraging them to register for the rally - and then not show.  The trend quickly spread on TikTok, where videos with millions of views instructed viewers to do the same, as CNN reported Tuesday. "Oh no. I signed up for a Trump rally, and I can't go," one woman joked, along with a fake cough, in a TikTok posted June 15.  Thousands of other users posted similar tweets and videos to TikTok that racked up millions of views. Representatives for TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  "It spread mostly through Alt TikTok - we kept it on the quiet side where people do pranks and a lot of activism," said YouTuber Elijah Daniel, 26, who participated in the campaign....</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TULSA, Okla. - President Donald Trump promoted his rally here on Saturday as an opportunity to reignite his reelection campaign and move past the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 120,000 Americans and devastated the economy. He claimed that nearly 1 million people had requested tickets and boasted, "We've never had an empty seat, and we certainly won't in Oklahoma."  Instead, he addressed his supporters, most of them unmasked, in a 19,000-seat arena with many spots unfilled, hours after his campaign had announced that six members of the advance team staffing the event had tested positive for the virus.  He used his platform to belittle testing, which public health experts say is required to contain the outbreak. Because the strategy reveals what the president characterized as trivial cases, his direction was to curtail it. "So I said to my people, 'Slow the testing down,' " he said, as the audience cheered.  There was no massive overflow audience; the area outside the arena had emptied out by early evening, and plans for Trump to address the audience outside were quickly scrapped. The campaign blamed protesters; there were only scattered efforts to block entrances, which were resolved by police.  The campaign said quarantine procedures had gone into effect for the infected staff members and those in "immediate contact" with them. Meanwhile, Tulsa County reported 136 new cases Saturday - marking another high for both single-day and average cases - while the state as a whole reported 331 new infections.  Upon entering the rally grounds, attendees were handed blue face coverings - which many chose not to wear - and directed through a maze of metal fencing, which led to a touchless temperature screening conducted by volunteers in purple smocks. Most police officers and National Guard soldiers on the rally...</description>
