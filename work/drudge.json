He later served as Senior Vice President for Production at MGM and, later, as President of Lorimar films. Peter is also the author of nine books, and is a member of PMC's board of advisors."

He also is an author: Doubleday published his book about The Three Stooges, \"From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons,\" which ABC turned into a telepic executive produced by Mel Gibson. One of Mike\u2019s early jobs in journalism was editor of the well-known Media Industry Newsletter (MIN). He then joined New York Newsday as a columnist, reviewer and entertainment writer. During his career, he has written for numerous magazines including Playboy, Details, TV Guide and Esquire."
