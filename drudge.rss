      <title>Brutal Cold Smashes Records...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Brutal-cold-air-outbreak-is-smashing-records-in-13576514.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temperatures dove more than 30 degrees below zero Thursday morning in the Midwest in this polar vortex outbreak's last gasp, driving wind chills to dangerous levels and clobbering long-standing records. After a bitter-cold morning with temperatures that sank all the way to minus-48 in northwest Minnesota, with wind chills down to minus-65, the air ostensibly "warmed" Wednesday afternoon, to readings such as minus-18 in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and minus-22 in Rockford, Illinois. But it didn't take long into the late afternoon for the mercury to plummet again to readings well below minus-20, minus-30 and in some locations in north-central Minnesota, minus-40 by Thursday morning.</description>

      <title>Military turning on Maduro?</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/820845/venezuela-opposition-leader-juan-guaid-discloses-clandestine-meetings-military</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a New York Times op-ed published late Wednesday, Venezuelan opposition leader and U.S.-backed interim president Juan GuaidÃ³ made his case that he, rather than President Nicolas Maduro, is the constitutionally legitimate leader of Venezuela. The opposition's plan to manage Maduro's "exit with the minimum of bloodshed," he wrote, is to shore up the opposition-led National Assembly, "consolidate the support of the international community," form "a transitional government," and hold "free elections." GuaidÃ³ added: The transition will require support from key military contingents. We have had clandestine meetings with members of the armed forces and the security forces. We have offered amnesty to all those who are found not guilty of crimes against humanity. The military's withdrawal of support from Mr. Maduro is crucial to enabling a change in government, and the majority of those in service agree that the country's recent travails are untenable. [Juan GuaidÃ³, The New York Times] GuaidÃ³ "did not say who in the military he had been speaking with or what their positions were," BBC News reports. "Venezuela's top military representative to the U.S., Col. JosÃ© Luis Silva, has defected â€” but senior military figures in Venezuela have supported Mr. Maduro," and many of them hold influential posts in his government. So far, the U.S. and more than 20 other nations have recognized GuaidÃ³ as interim president and the European Union says it will do so if Maduro doesn't announce new elections by Sunday, while Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey are among the countries that back Maduro. Maduro told Russia's RIA news agency that he is prepared to hold talks with the opposition "for the good of Venezuela," but GuaidÃ³ writes in the Times that while "Maduro and his henchmen disingenuously propose 'dialogue'" when repression fails, "we have become immune to such manipulation. There are no more stunts left for them to pull." Read the entire op-ed at The New York Times. Peter Weber</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/science/article/mutant-coyotes-blue-eyes-pt-reyes-photo-13574847.php </link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel Dietrich was driving around Point Reyes National Seashore one afternoon last year when he saw a flash of piercing blue. It was a coyote.  "I passed it, pulled my car over onto the shoulder of the road and waited," said Dietrich, the owner of Point Reyes Safaris, a wildlife and photography tour company.  The coyote eventually sauntered down the hillside to drink from the stream. When it lifted its head, Dietrich snapped a photo. It wasn't until he downloaded the images to his computer that he realized this coyote was distinct from the many he had seen in Point Reyes. It's eyes were a striking blue. Most coyotes have brown irises.  Following that afternoon in January 2018, Dietrich spotted a second blue-eyed coyote in Point Reyes, which he determined was distinct from the first because of an injury to its eye. National Geographic has since tracked down photographs of blue-eyed coyotes taken near Santa Cruz and Sacramento.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will unveil a plan Thursday to dramatically expand the federal estate tax on the wealthy, including a new 77 percent rate on billionaires' estates, as leading Democratic politicians push new taxes on the richest Americans to combat inequality. Sanders's bill, the "For the 99.8% Act," would tax the estates of the 0.2 percent of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million, while the rest of the country "would not see their taxes go up by one penny under this plan," according to aides to the Vermont senator, who is considering a 2020 presidential bid.</description>

      <link>https://www.apnews.com/c17d96857ebd4f7c9449b2eac8a7c27c</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new report estimates that nearly half of all U.S. adults have some form of heart or blood vessel disease, a medical milestone that's mostly due to recent guidelines that expanded how many people have high blood pressure. The American Heart Association says that more than 121 million adults had cardiovascular disease in 2016. Taking out those with only high blood pressure leaves 24 million, or 9 percent of adults, who have other forms of disease such as heart failure or clogged arteries. High blood pressure is now considered to be a reading above 130 over 80. It raises the risk for heart attacks, strokes and many other problems. Only about half of those with the condition have it under control.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — No televised roundtables with Cabinet secretaries. No freewheeling speeches from the Oval Office. No shouted comments on his way to Marine One. Where's the president? While the federal government is open once again, President Donald Trump has been largely behind closed doors. Republicans and Democrats alike seem just fine with Trump hanging back as legislators try to work out a deal to keep the government open and resolve a standoff over funding for the president's long-sought wall at the southern border. In fact, some lawmakers think less Trump might be a good thing, given his rocky relationships with legislators and open criticism of his negotiating abilities.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — A federal judge on Wednesday rejected a request to unseal criminal charges against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange that were mistakenly revealed in another case. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said in a 10-page ruling that free-press advocates seeking to unseal the charges have no proof Assange has actually been charged. The Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press sought to unseal the charges after a federal prosecutor inadvertently typed a reference to "the fact that Assange has been charged" in an unrelated case.</description>

      <title>Warns of socialism coming to USA...</title>
      <link>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/01/30/howard_schultz_elizabeth_warrens_programs_will_lead_to_socialism_in_america.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Starbucks CEO and independent candidate for president Howard Schultz said he does not support the tax policies of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in an interview Wednesday on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe.' Schultz said Warren "believes in programs that will lead to a level of socialism." Schultz also revealed that when Warren sought a donation for her Senate campaign he declined because of her socialist agenda. "I've also been criticized for being a billionaire," Schultz said Wednesday. "Let's talk about that. I'm self-made. I grew up in the project in Brooklyn, New York. I thought that was the American dream, the aspiration of America. You're going to criticize me for -- for being successful when in my company over the last 30 years, the only company in America that gave comprehensive health insurance, equity in the form of stock options, and free college tuition? And Elizabeth Warren wants to criticize me for being successful?" "I don't believe what Elizabeth Warren stands for," Schultz said Wednesday. "I don't believe the country should be heading to socialism." "I think she believes in programs that will lead to a level of socialism in America. She's a smart woman. I respect her. This isn't personal. I just don't agree with her," he added. WILLIE GEIST, 'MORNING JOE' CO-HOST: So Senator Warren, as you know, put out a plan -- HOWARD SCHULTZ, INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT: Yes. GEIST: A 2-percent tax on people with $50 million or more in assets. SCHULTZ: Yes. GEIST: You called that plan ridiculous. SCHULTZ: Yes. GEIST: We show a poll earlier in the show that said the American public likes that idea a lot. And they hear someone like you with billions of dollars calling it ridiculous and say, of course, he wants to protect his own money. SCHULTZ: No. GEIST: What do you say to that? SCHULTZ: Well, if that plan was put in place, it probably could fund the government for a day or two. So that's not the answer. The answer is, let's take a step back from this. Let's not send out a tweet or a press release that make news. Let's get serious people around the table and solve this problem once and for all, which is comprehensive tax reform. GEIST: Do you think Elizabeth Warren's a serious person on taxes? SCHULTZ: I think she's a serious person, yes. MIKA BRZEZINSKI, 'MORNING JOE' CO-HOST: Yes. SCHULTZ: She -- she came to see me a few years ago and asked me for a contribution for her Senate race? BRZEZINSKI: Did you give it to her? SCHULTZ: I did not. BRZEZINSKI: OK. Wow. MIKE BARNICLE, 'MORNING JOE' CO-HOST: Why? SCHULTZ: I don't believe what Elizabeth Warren is -- what -- stands for. I don't -- I don't believe the country should be heading to socialism. BARNICLE: Do you think she's a socialist? SCHULTZ: I think she believes in programs that will lead to a level of socialism in America. She's a smart woman. I respect her. This isn't personal. I just don't agree with her.</description>
