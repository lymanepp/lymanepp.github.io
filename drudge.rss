      <title>How we survive surveillance apocalypse...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/How-we-survive-the-surveillance-apocalypse-14943110.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Go, go gadgets" has long been the attitude in my house. Perhaps yours, too: A smartphone made it easier to stay in touch. A smart TV streamed a zillion more shows. A smart speaker let you talk to a smart thermostat without getting out of bed. That's progress, right?  Now I've got a new attitude: It's not just what I can get out of technology - I want to know what the technology gets out of me.  For the past year, I've been on the trail of the secret life of our data. What happens when you put your iPhone to sleep at night? Does Amazon's Alexa eavesdrop on your family? Who gets to know where you drive - and where you swipe your credit card?  Trying to get straight answers has been, literally, a full-time job. I've digested the legal word salad of privacy policies, interrogated a hundred companies and even hacked into a car dashboard to grab my data back. There are lots of stories about online threats, but it feels different watching your personal information streaming out of devices you take for granted. This year I learned there is no such thing as "incognito." Just stepping out for an errand, I discovered, lets my car record where I shop, what I listen to and even how much I weigh.  Learning how everyday things spy on us made me, at times, feel paranoid. Mostly, my privacy project left me angry. Our cultural reference points - Big Brother and tinfoil hats - don't quite capture the sickness of an era when we gleefully carry surveillance machines in our pockets and install them in our homes.  With each discovery, I've looked for ways to change my own relationship with technology. I've stopped installing new smart-home devices that let corporations or police log what's happening at my house. I switched web browsers and credit cards. When possible, I use a pseudonym or a throwaway email address.  Still, I'm going to level...</description>

      <title>Amazons were long considered myth. These discoveries show warrior women were real...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Amazons-were-long-considered-a-myth-These-14942704.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a long time, modern scholars believed that the Amazons were little more than a figment of ancient imaginations.  These were the fierce warrior women of Ancient Greek lore who supposedly sparred with Hercules, lived in lesbian matriarchies and hacked off their breasts so they could fire their arrows better. Homer immortalized them in the Iliad. Eons later, they played a central role in the Wonder Woman comics.  Some historians argued they were probably a propaganda tool created to keep Athenian women in line. Another theory suggested that they may have been beardless men mistaken for women by the Greeks.  But a growing body of archaeological evidence shows that legends about the horseback-riding, bow-wielding female fighters were almost certainly rooted in reality. Myths about the Amazons' homosexuality and self-mutilation are still dubious at best, but new research appears to confirm that there really were groups of nomadic women who trained, hunted and battled alongside their male counterparts in the Eurasian steppe.  In a landmark discovery revealed earlier this month, archaeologists unearthed the remains of four female warriors buried with a cache of arrowheads, spears and horseback riding equipment in a tomb in Western Russia - right where Ancient Greek stories placed the Amazons.  The team from the Institute of Archaeology of the Russian Academy of Sciences identified the women as Scythian nomads who were interred at a burial site some 2,500 years ago near the present-day community of Devitsa. The women ranged in age from early teens to late 40s, according to the archaeologists. And the eldest of the women was found wearing a golden ceremonial headdress, a calathus, engraved with floral ornaments - an indication of stature.  The discovery represents some of the most detailed evidence to date that female warriors...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/crime/article/Philadelphia-homicide-rate-hits-high-for-decade-14942019.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Philadelphia’s new police chief has a challenging agenda ahead that includes addressing the city’s gun violence and homicide rates. Two shooting deaths Tuesday make 2019 the city's deadliest year in a decade. Police say one man was fatally shot near Temple University Hospital and another in the Hunting Park section. Police have tallied 355 slayings this year, two more than 2018. The count had fallen to about 250 to 275 homicides annually from 2013 to 2016. Police say they’ve made arrests this year in just over half the homicide cases. Separately, they say more than 1,450 people were shot in the city this year. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney announced Monday that he’d selected Police Chief Danielle Outlaw of Portland, Oregon, to lead the 6,500-member force. Outlaw says she’s prepared for the challenge and calls gun violence a top priority. Philadelphia, with about 1.5 million people, has more homicides than New York City, which has five times as many people but stricter gun laws.</description>
