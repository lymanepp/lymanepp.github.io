      <title>Inside new UBER: Weak coffee, vanishing perks, fast-deflating morale...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Inside-the-new-Uber-Weak-coffee-vanishing-perks-14478225.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN FRANCISCO - Tech IPOs have long been viewed as a boon for Silicon Valley workers, ushering in a new era of corporate stability and stock-driven wealth.  That's not been the case at Uber, where the stock price has fallen roughly 30 percent since going public in May and employees say they've noticed cuts to amenities as basic as the brands of coffee available for brewing.  Uber is changing as it shifts from a closely held unicorn start-up to a publicly traded company that appears to be losing investors' confidence, according to interviews with current and former workers. Those changes include laying off more than 800 workers over the summer.  Meanwhile, stock units are valued at a fraction of what many employees were led to believe. And executives are imposing workflow changes aimed at improving the company's efficiency, adjustments that strike some employees as stifling innovation.  "We need to ship more quickly and operate more effectively and efficiently than we are today," Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a recent company email following the announcement of engineering and product team layoffs. "We are not doing this for Wall Street. We are doing this for Uber. It's critical we get our edge back and continually push ourselves to do better."  Uber was the second of what was supposed to be a blockbuster summer of public offerings. But many haven't gone as expected, raising questions about a potential tech bubble. Rival Lyft was the first. Its stock price plunged in the days following its $72-per-share opening, rounding out the summer more than 40 percent below that price. WeWork, which was set to go public this month, was forced to postpone its IPO date amid billions in losses and conflicts of interest for its embattled chief executive, who stepped down from that role Tuesday.  In fact, the wave of 2018 and 2019...</description>
