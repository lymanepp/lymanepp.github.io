      <title>Food supply nightmare...</title>
      <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-facing-food-supply-nightmare-192425383.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Restaurants in Texas are throwing out expired food, grocery stores are closing early amid stock shortages and residents are struggling to find basic necessities as a cold blast continues to upend supply chains.At Tarka Indian Kitchen, a chain with eight locations in Texas, fresh veggies and meat were discarded after the chain was shuttered for days. The same is true for Coolgreens, which sells salads and sandwiches, while Milkshake Concepts had to throw out inventory due to a burst pipe. Similar stories are piling up during a historic cold spell that has knocked out power and snarled roads.At a Whole Foods Market store in the Woodlands, Texas, two women were overheard exchanging tips on where to find a gallon of milk, while another person asked a store employee about buying the entire supply of bottled water.The situation is so dire in Houston, a major city for dining out, some people have running lists of restaurants that are open and have food supplies. Late Thursday, a canvass of restaurants in the area showed several were either out of food, unexpectedly closed or only available for large group orders. People were complaining about difficulties using UberEats and DoorDash as a result.Read More: Texas Water Outages Affect 14.4 Million People: Energy UpdateTarka Chief Executive Officer Tinku Saini said via email that the issues extend beyond expired food. “We’ve transitioned to working through the water challenges -- access to water, low water pressure and boil-water notices in some areas. Then, we are navigating the obstacles with suppliers as they determine the safest way to deliver our products.”The challenges are further limiting residents’ access to food as grocery store shelves remain barren in many areas. Supermarket chains such as Kroger Co. have implemented purchase limits on items such as eggs and milk, while HEB Grocery Co. said the weather is causing “severe disruption in the food supply chain.”Some chains that have managed to remain open have been closing before sunset so shelves can be restocked overnight. Hard-to-find items in the Houston area include beef, bread, deli meats, frozen pizzas and milk. A visit to an HEB store in the city’s northern suburbs on Thursday afternoon found the produce section with little more than a few bags of oranges.Target Corp. closed three stores in Texas and was restocking food and water in stores that are still open. Amazon.com Inc.’s Whole Foods Market chain is working to “reopen all stores in the coming days,” a spokesperson said in an email.Indeed, there’s hope operations may return to normal soon as services come back online and temperatures rise. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the state’s grid, said it had returned to normal operations Friday.Related: Gas Stations Still Dark as Texas Emerges From FreezeStill, many restaurants, which have already endured a nightmare year from pandemic-driven shutdowns, face obstacles to reopening. Some companies are trying to adapt in the meantime.Dickey’s Barbecue Pit, which has 142 Texas locations, said it could be a week or two until it is back to normal hours and full menus, though operations are resuming at most of its restaurants. The company has altered its menu and is going directly to its suppliers when possible to pick up food.On Monday, as the lights flickered at its 80-year-old original location in Dallas, staff began giving away food to first responders instead of letting it expire.“With the understanding that our food is no good to anyone if it’s spoiled and these heroes need it most, I encourage anyone who is able to do the same,” Dickey’s CEO Laura Rea Dickey said.(Updates with details of food shortage beginning in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</description>

      <title>11-year-old boy dies of hypothermia in mobile home...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/An-11-year-old-boy-died-in-an-unheated-Texas-15962627.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though he was still in bed after 2 p.m. on Tuesday under a pile of blankets in their unheated mobile home in Conroe, Texas, Maria Elisa Pineda wasn't concerned when she checked on her son. After all, Cristian Pavon, 11, was known for sleeping in, his mother told Univision.  But when Pineda nudged the boy, Cristian did not respond to her touch.  It was too late by then. Cristian was pronounced dead that afternoon, and authorities are investigating whether the otherwise healthy boy died of hypothermia after the family's home lost power over the weekend and temperatures in Conroe dipped to single digits earlier this week.  "He was OK," Pineda told Univision. "I never imagined this could happen. We think it was because of the cold because he was doing well. He had dinner, played and he went to bed."  Cristian is among the youngest to die since Sunday, when winter storms left millions without electricity and water. So far, at least 47 people have died in the frigid cold weather, a figure authorities say is likely to rise as freezing temperatures continue and future wellness checks reveal the full magnitude of the tragedy.  At least 30 of those deaths came in Texas, The Washington Post reported, a state where continuous power outages have exposed residents to dangerously low temperatures. Some have died of carbon monoxide poisoning after turning to their ovens or trucks to stay warm. Others, like a 75-year-old man in Crosby, Texas,whose oxygen machine stopped working after his home lost power, have been found dead of hypothermia inside their homes or cars.  Cristian, who was born in the coastal city of Tela, Honduras, came to Texas in 2019 to reunite with his mother, who he had not seen for over a year, Univision reported.  On Monday, he saw snow for the first time after the...</description>

      <title>Ready to Meet With Iran...</title>
      <link>https://news.yahoo.com/iran-says-u-must-lift-094022475.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;news.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Iran said the U.S. must first return to the 2015 nuclear deal and lift sanctions if it wants to start talks with the Islamic Republic, appearing to snub an effort by the Biden administration to begin direct discussions before officially rejoining the accord.The “key sequence” for nuclear talks between the Iran and U.S. is commitment, action then a meeting, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a tweet on Friday.The reaction -- and a similar comment from Iran’s foreign minister -- highlighted the challenges in ending an impasse that has threatened to tip the Persian Gulf region into a new conflict in the years since former President Donald Trump exited the 2015 deal and reimposed sanctions.On Thursday, the Biden administration said it would be willing to meet with Iran to discuss a “diplomatic way forward” in efforts to return to the nuclear deal, a first step toward easing tensions.“The United States would accept an invitation from the European Union High Representative to attend a meeting of the P5+1 and Iran to discuss a diplomatic way forward on Iran’s nuclear program,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. The P5+1 refers to the participants in the nuclear deal with Iran: China, Russia, France, the U.K., the U.S and Germany.Biden also lifted travel restrictions on Iranian enjoys and reversed a Trump-era claim that the U.S. had reimposed -- or “snapped back” -- United Nations sanctions on Iran, according to a letter sent to the UN Security Council and seen by Bloomberg.U.S. Says It’s Willing to Meet With Iran to Restore Nuclear DealThe offer is a politically risky effort by President Joe Biden to move beyond the standoff after the slew of U.S. sanctions cratered Iran’s economy and infuriated other world leaders, who argued that the accord and the inspections regime it created had reined in Tehran’s nuclear program.European parties to the nuclear deal welcomed the U.S. overture. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call Friday that Russia has “repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment” to the nuclear pact.While a turn away from a policy of sanctions is “by itself” a good thing, “it is the restoration of the JCPOA regime that is important,” Peskov said, using a formal abbreviation for the accord.The U.S. offer to hold talks was aimed at restoring a diplomatic pathway with Iran, which has been gradually abandoning its commitments under the nuclear deal in response to the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign.U.S. and European officials are particularly alarmed by Iran’s decision to stop letting the International Atomic Energy Agency conduct snap inspections by suspending the so-called Additional Protocol from Feb. 23.But politics loom large on both sides. The Biden administration doesn’t want to be seen as offering too much to Tehran and risk getting burned if an agreement can’t be reached.President Hassan Rouhani wants to save the accord and his legacy before he leaves office later this year, but he’s determined not to cave into U.S. demands. His hardline opponents -- who control most of Iran’s powerful state institutions and are likely to dominate June’s presidential elections -- oppose any engagement with the U.S. and want closer ties with Russia.(Updates with background on Iran and additional Biden measures; Kremlin reaction.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</description>

      <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-nears-1-trillion-value-055731771.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin is closing in on a market value of $1 trillion, a surge that’s helping cryptocurrency returns far outstrip the performance of more traditional assets like stocks and gold.The largest token has added more than $415 billion of value in 2021 to about $956 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which includes Bitcoin and four other coins, has more than doubled.Speculators, corporate treasurers and institutional investors are thought to have stoked Bitcoin’s volatile ascent. Crypto believers are dueling with skeptics for the dominant narrative around the climb: the former see an asset being embraced for its ability to hedge risks such as inflation, while the latter sense a precarious mania riding atop waves of monetary and fiscal stimulus.FOMO -- fear of missing out -- may be at play, said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy with AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney, adding that “in times of easy money this gets magnified and it’s partly what’s driving the current interest.”Bitcoin traded at around $51,300 as of 1:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong after quintupling in the past year. The crypto index’s performance towers over stocks, gold, commodities and bonds in 2021.This month, Tesla Inc. disclosed a $1.5 billion investment and MicroStrategy Inc. boosted a sale of convertible bonds to $900 million to buy even more of the token. That brought the coin closer to corporate America.“If companies’ fundamentals are going to become closely tied to movements in Bitcoin because they’ve suddenly become speculators on the side, we’re going to be in bubble territory before you know it,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst with Oanda Europe Ltd.Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk posted a somewhat cryptic tweet Friday that appeared in part to defend the company’s action, saying Bitcoin “is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash” while adding that the electric vehicle maker’s decision isn’t “directly reflective of my opinion.”Read More: Musk Defends Tesla Bitcoin Move, Says Token Less Dumb Than CashThe “long Bitcoin” trade is seen as among the most crowded in the world alongside technology exposure and dollar shorts, according to the February edition of Bank of America’s global fund manager survey.AMP’s Oliver said if Bitcoin “falls out of favor -- for example due to government regulation or investors just moving on to the next new thing -- then it could quickly plunge.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</description>
