      <title>Rudy in Ukraine...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/882282/rudy-giuliani-literally-ukraine-right-now</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was most certainly not a good idea. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor turned lawyer to President Trump turned linchpin of this whole impeachment situation, is back in Ukraine while the House debates the impeachment of his boss. And not only that, but he's there to talk to multiple former Ukrainian prosecutors who sparked a lot of his problems in the first place, people familiar with his efforts tell The New York Times. As the House continues its investigation of Trump, Giuliani, and their dealings with Ukraine, Giuliani has been overseas in an effort to 'shift the focus to purported wrongdoing by President Trumpâ€™s political rivals,' the Times writes. On Tuesday, he reportedly met with former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko in Budapest. Lutsenko is one of the prosecutors accused of ignoring corruption in Ukraine's government and had once been skeptical of the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine before recanting his suspicions. Trump seemed to praise Lutsenko as a 'very good prosecutor' during his July 25 call with Ukraine's president, who had dismissed Lutsenko. Then on Wednesday, as the House Judiciary Committee began its impeachment hearings with legal experts, Giuliani reportedly headed to Kyiv in Ukraine to meet other ex-prosecutors who targeted the Bidens. They included Viktor Shokin, who was pushed out of his position amid criticism from then-Vice President Joe Biden, and Kostiantyn Kulyk, who led the investigation into Burisma. All of the information Giuliani gathers is apparently going into 'episodes of a documentary series for a conservative television outlet promoting his pro-Trump, anti-impeachment narrative,' the Times continues.

      <title>France braces for massive strikes and transportation disruptions..</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/France-braces-for-massive-strikes-and-14881005.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARIS -France is bracing for major transportation disruptions throughout the country starting Thursday, as trade unions launch a strike in response to changes President Emmanuel Macron wants to make to the country's retirement system.  Much of the Paris Metro will be shut down, as will many national and international train lines, including certain Eurostar services. Flights will also be canceled, as air traffic controllers say they will join the protests through Saturday.  Strikes and protests, of course, are a well-known fixture of French life, from the student uprisings of 1968 to the "yellow vest" demonstrations against inequality that stunned the French government last year with their vigor and violence. No other Western democracy seems to have as high a tolerance for burning cars and broken windows.  But these protests could be bigger and more destabilizing than most.  Macron is playing with political fire: The retirement system is a beloved feature of France's famously generous welfare state.  The last time the French government seriously tried to overhaul it, in 1995, protests paralyzed the country for more than three weeks and forced then-President Jacques Chirac to back down and accept a stinging political defeat.  And although French transport unions largely steered clear of the yellow vest demonstrations over the past year, they are expressing the same anger that certain segments of the population have been abandoned by their leaders.  Yellow vest protesters could join these demonstrations. Teachers unions, postal workers, hospital workers and the police may also support the strikes.  "It's the coalition of all frustrations, and it demonstrates the isolation of the elite, the isolation of the president, even the personal rejection of Macron," said Dominique...</description>
