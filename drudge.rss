      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Justice Department took a significant step this week toward advancing its long-promised crackdown on leaks, charging a former Senate Intelligence Committee staffer with lying to the FBI about his contacts with reporters, and seizing the phone and email records of a journalist to help make its case. As the man charged in the brewing controversy made his first court appearance, free-press advocates warned that federal prosecutors' heavy-handed tactics might send a further chill through the government, where officials already are reluctant to share information.</description>

A 26-foot Seward Johnson statue illustrating the star in her iconic pose from "The Seven Year Itch" was installed this week in Latham Park as part of the Stamford Downtown Special Services District's "Art in Public Places" series that lasts through the summer. But much like the subway grate stirred up her skirt, Monroe has created a whirlwind in just a few days in Stamford. Lorri Tamburro, a lifelong Stamford resident, was disturbed when she visited the statue with her husband and watched children climbing up Monroe's leg and looking up her skirt.</description>
