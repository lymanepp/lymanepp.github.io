The inmates, some of whom were menstruating, were told to remove their clothes, and lift and spread their body parts, in full view of one another. Deputies yelled degrading comments and profanities as they made their orders. Some laughed.</description>

      <title>GEORGE:  I denied that Trump was a racist. Not anymore...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/opinion/article/I-denied-that-Trump-was-a-racist-Not-anymore-14097653.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;To this day, I can remember almost the precise spot where it happened: a supermarket parking lot in eastern Massachusetts. It was the mid-1970s; I was not yet a teenager, or barely one. I don't remember exactly what precipitated the woman's ire. But I will never forget what she said to my mother, who had come to this country from the Philippines decades before. In these words or something close, the woman said, "Go back to your country."  I remember the incident well, but it never bothered me all that much. Nor did racial slurs, which, thankfully, were rare. None of it was troublesome, to my mind, because most Americans weren't like that. The woman in the parking lot was just a boor, an ignoramus, an aberration. America promised equality. Its Constitution said so. My schoolbooks said so. The country wasn't perfect, to be sure. But its ideals were. And every day brought us closer to those ideals.  To a young boy, it seemed like long ago that a descendant of slaves had prophesied, five days before I was born, that his "four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." We would be there soon enough, if we weren't there already. I couldn't understand why colleges required applicants to check boxes for race or ethnicity. I'm also part Irish and Scottish. What box should I check? Should I check one at all? Will that help me or hurt me? Never mind, not to worry, those boxes would someday soon be gone.  How naive a child could be. The woman in the parking lot - there were many more like her, it turned out. They never went away. Today they attend rallies, and they post ugliness on Facebook or Twitter. As for the victims of historic racial oppression, no matter how much affirmative action (or reverse discrimination, or whatever you...</description>

      <title>TUMULTY:  It's time for Obama to speak up... </title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/opinion/article/It-s-time-for-Obama-to-speak-up-14097546.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;An open letter to Barack Obama:  Mr. President, it is time. You must speak. Your country needs you.  Eleven summers ago, as you accepted the Democratic nomination for president, you announced: "Tonight, I say to the people of America, to Democrats and Republicans and independents across this great land: Enough. This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive."  Of course, we knew then that our nation had deep political differences, and would continue to. Only the most naive among us would have expected the election of the first African American president to come about with no backlash.  But would anyone have anticipated that within a dozen years, we would hear another president tell four non-white congresswomen - three of whom were born in this country - to "go back" to where they came from?  Donald Trump's tweets over the weekend were the basest kind of bigotry, the oldest of racist tropes. And they were a reminder that in the eyes of some, who apparently include our current president, people of color will never be seen as fully American, regardless of how many generations their families have been part of this nation's story or how much they achieve as individuals.  President Obama, I understand your reluctance to weigh in on Trump's latest transgression. You are a respecter of norms, including the one dictating that former presidents steer clear of criticizing their successors. And for all the barriers you shattered, racism was never a topic upon which you seemed eager to hold forth.  But silence now is unacceptable. It is time to make yourself heard.  We have long since given up expectations that anyone in Trump's own party will do or say anything to call him out for what he is. The few who tried at the beginning have...</description>
