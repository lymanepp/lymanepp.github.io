"That is something we internally talk about," Pace replied. "There's no question, the obvious advantages to that, versus going out and signing.

      <title>DC proposal would let police take guns from people accused of domestic abuse...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/D-C-proposal-would-let-police-take-guns-from-13470614.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The D.C. Council on Tuesday could pass new laws restricting the ability of gun owners to modify weapons and require police to seize guns while enforcing protective orders in domestic disputes. The latter provision - known as a "red flag law" - is gaining popularity, with variants implemented in more than a dozen states, including Maryland. The D.C. version would mandate that authorities take firearms out of the hands of suspected abusers more quickly than is permitted under existing laws. Other proposed laws, if passed, would the ban rapid-fire attachments known as bump stocks and increase penalties for extended magazines, accessories that allow guns to fire faster and hold more bullets.</description>
