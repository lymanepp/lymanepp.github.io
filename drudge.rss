      <title>Biden's brain surgeon defends his brain...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/860046/joe-bidens-brain-surgeon-defending-joe-bidens-brain</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enough with the worrying, former Vice President Joe Biden's brain surgeon says. As some voters murmur that the gaffe-prone Democratic presidential candidate's age is cause for extra concern this campaign cycle, Dr. Neal Kassell â€” the man who performed surgery on Biden three decades ago following two brain aneurysms â€” came out swinging for his former patient. Kassell dismissed fears about the 76-year-old Biden's mental faculties, noting that he's "as sharp as he was 31 years ago" and assuring people that the hemorrhage and subsequent operations did not result in any brain damage. "I am going to vote for the candidate who I am absolutely certain has a brain that is functioning," Kassell told Politico. "And that narrows it down to exactly one." Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, backed up Kassell. "Vice President Biden is in excellent physical condition," he said. "He is more than capable of handling the rigors of the campaign and the office for which he is running." In fact, several experts told Politico that voters are placing too great an emphasis on the age of several candidates, particularly the five septuagenarians who are running, including Democratic candidates Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), 77, as well as 73-year-old President Trump and his lone Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who is 74. "They have prospects for survival that extend well beyond the four-year term of the office," said Dr. Jay Olshansky, who led an American Federation of Aging Research study last month that sought to determine how likely it is that a candidate would die while in office. "The bottom line is their chronological age does not matter at all." Read more at Politico. Tim O'Donnell</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Teen-arrested-for-threatening-slaughter-at-14362981.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When federal agents arrived last week at Farhan Sheikh's Chicago residence with a search warrant, the 19-year-old suspected they were there because of a "joke" he had posted on a popular meme-sharing platform, according to a complaint unsealed on Monday.  The allegedly humorous post? A threat to "slaughter and murder any doctor, patient, or visitor" at an abortion clinic about four miles from his home, the complaint said.  "I am done with my state and [their] bulls--- abortion laws and allowing [innocent] kids to be slaughtered for the so called 'womans right' bulls---," Sheikh allegedly wrote in one of the posts. "Ive seen nothing but whores go out of the way to get an abortion, but no more. I will not tolerate this anymore. Im DONE. On August 23rd 2019, . . . I will proceed to slaughter and murder any doctor, patient, or visitor i see in the area and I will not back down. consider this a warning for anyone visiting . . ."  In another, he allegedly taunted, "come after me you degenerate government puppets, stop me if you can."  On Monday, Sheikh, who was arrested last week, was charged with transmitting a threat in interstate commerce, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, federal prosecutors in Illinois said in a news release. His arrest is the latest of its kind as law enforcement agencies continue to face heightened scrutiny over how they handle online threats of violence in the aftermath of recent back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.  A lawyer for Sheikh could not be reached for comment early Tuesday.  The FBI began its investigation when threatening messages appeared on iFunny, an online forum, on Aug. 13, the complaint said. The user behind the posts, who went by the name "awarded," was identified as Sheikh, authorities...</description>

      <title>Couple married for love. Then bride's father hired assassins...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/A-young-Indian-couple-married-for-love-Then-the-14357641.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MIRYALAGUDA, India - They were young, glamorous and dreamily in love.  Pranay Perumalla strode into the wedding hall in a midnight blue suit, his face lit by a grin as he clasped the hand of his bride, Amrutha Varshini. The couple draped huge garlands of flowers around one another's necks and relatives threw grains of yellow rice that caught in their dark hair.  But even as they celebrated, they were already in danger.  One bright afternoon less than a month later, the couple left a doctor's appointment in the small southern Indian city where they grew up. A man came up behind them carrying a large butcher knife in his right hand. He hacked Pranay twice on the head and neck, killing him instantly.  Pranay, 23, was a Dalit, a term used to describe those formerly known as "untouchables." Amrutha, 21, belongs to an upper caste. Her rich and powerful family viewed the couple's union as an unacceptable humiliation. Her father, T. Maruthi Rao, was so enraged that he hired killers to murder his son-in-law, court documents say.  While Indian society is changing, it is not shifting rapidly enough for couples like Amrutha and Pranay, whose marriage defied an age-old system of discrimination and hierarchy. Even as India has lifted millions out of poverty, increased education rates and built one of the world's fastest-growing economies, the influence of caste - a social order rooted in Hindu scriptures and based on an identity determined at birth - remains pervasive.  That system is at its most resilient in marriage. A 2017 study found that just 5.8% of Indian marriages are between people of different castes, a rate that has changed little in four decades. The results surprised the researchers, who had expected to see "more intermingling of the different castes," said Tridip Ray, a statistician and the lead author. "Unfortunately,...</description>

      <title>WHITE HOUSE MULLS PAYROLL TAX CUT</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/White-House-officials-eyeing-payroll-tax-cut-in-14360954.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several senior White House officials have begun discussing whether to push for a temporary payroll tax cut as a way to arrest an economic slowdown, three people familiar with the discussions said, revealing the growing concerns by President Donald Trump's top economic aides.  The talks are still in their early stages, and the officials have not decided whether to formally push Congress to approve the cut, these people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to disclose internal discussions. But the White House in recent days has begun searching for proposals that could halt a slowing economy.  Millions of Americans pay a "payroll tax" on their earnings, a 6.2 percent levy that is used to finance Medicare and Social Security programs. The payroll tax was last cut during the Obama administration, to 4.2 percent, as a way to encourage more consumer spending during the recent economic downturn. But the cut was allowed to reset back up to 6.2 percent in 2013.  Americans pay payroll taxes on income up to $132,900, so cutting the payroll tax has remained a popular idea for many lawmakers seeking to deliver savings for middle-income earners and not the wealthiest Americans. But payroll tax cuts can also add dramatically to the deficit and - depending on how they are designed - pull billions of dollars away from Social Security and Medicare.  The discussions about whether to pursue a new payroll tax cut have only begun in recent days, the three people said, and specific details about the design have not been reached yet.  Trump and top aides have spent the past few days trying to convince the public that the economy is strong and that fears about a recession are misguided. But White House officials quietly have begun scrambling for new ideas to reverse public concerns and boost business...</description>
