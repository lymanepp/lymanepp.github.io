      <title>Italy's death toll feeds fear of what lies ahead in Europe and USA...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Italy-s-coronavirus-death-toll-feeds-fear-of-what-15148487.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The locus of the coronavirus shifted to Europe on Saturday, with Italy bearing the brunt of the pandemic's unceasing spread. Italian officials announced that 791 people had succumbed to the virus in a single day. The staggering number brought the nation's total dead to more than 4,800, the most for a single country.  As death tolls mount across the continent, Italy has become a symbol of the enormous challenges facing public health authorities, in Europe and in the U.S., who are struggling to contain the virus.  Eleven days into Italy's nationwide lockdown, which includes travel restrictions and the closure of most stores apart from groceries and pharmacies, the number of confirmed cases still soared, with 6,557 new cases since Friday. Hospitals and morgues were overwhelmed. The government has reported 53,578 total cases, with the northern part of the country bearing the brunt.  Italy's struggle to keep up with the virus offered a glimpse into what U.S. health officials fear could be ahead in New York and elsewhere: shortages of respirators, basic medical equipment and beds in intensive-care units.  Among the help coming to northern Italy is a team of 65 Cuban doctors and nurses with experience in battling Ebola outbreaks, Italian health officials said. In Bergamo, among the most devastated areas, military trucks have lined up outside a hospital to take the dead to faraway crematoriums.  Italy now stands atop a grim list of global statistics, surpassing the death toll in China, where the virus originated. But surging rates of infection were not limited to the country.  In Spain, nearly 5,000 new cases were reported Saturday. The nation's death toll, which was about 1,000 on Friday, ticked up to 1,326 in a single day. Spain's military was called in to convert a convention center in Madrid to a field hospital with 5,500...</description>

      <title>U.S. intelligence reports from January and February warned about likely pandemic...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Intelligence-officials-early-alarms-about-15147137.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - U.S. intelligence agencies were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February about the global danger posed by the coronavirus while President Donald Trump and lawmakers played down the threat and failed to take action that might have slowed the spread of the pathogen, according to U.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting.  The intelligence reports didn't predict when the virus might land on U.S. shores or recommend particular steps that public health officials should take, issues outside the purview of the intelligence agencies. But they did track the spread of the virus in China, and later in other countries, and warned that Chinese officials appeared to be minimizing the severity of the outbreak.  Taken together, the reports and warnings painted an early picture of a virus that showed the characteristics of a globe-encircling pandemic that could require governments to take swift actions to contain it. But despite that constant flow of reporting, Trump continued publicly and privately to play down the threat the virus posed to Americans. Lawmakers, too, did not grapple with the virus in earnest until this month, as officials scrambled to keep citizens in their homes and hospitals braced for a surge in patients suffering from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  Intelligence agencies "have been warning on this since January," said a U.S. official who had access to intelligence reporting that was disseminated to members of Congress and their staffs as well as to officials in the Trump administration, and who, along with others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive information.  "Donald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were - they just couldn't get him to do anything about it," this official said....</description>
