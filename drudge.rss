      <title>Custom wood kennels, memory foam beds: Wild world of pet furniture...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/article/Custom-wood-kennels-memory-foam-beds-The-wild-14102846.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pet furniture has come a long way from teal carpeted cat towers and lumpy plaid dog beds.  For discerning pet owners who treat their cats and dogs like family - in some cases better than family - designers are creating stylish, even glamorous, furniture. Witness the new $5,000 Crystal Clear Lotus Cat Tower by the Refined Feline, with three platforms for lounging and a hideaway cubby at the bottom lined in white faux fur. (You can see one at the trendy Los Angeles cat cafe Crumbs &amp; Whiskers.) And now you and Buddy can catnap or watch DOGTV on matching tufted Chesterfield-style Wayfair Archie &amp; Oscar sofas; his is a $399 miniaturized version of yours in faux-leather scaled with similar nailhead trim and turned legs.  None of these products, however, guarantee that they will keep their paws off your favorite club chair.  Over the past five years, pet furniture has been growing in sophistication and durability, says Phil Cooper, a pet industry expert with more than 50 years in the business. This trend has blossomed with the development of regional pet stores and local pet boutiques, which tend to offer more personalized service than big-box stores, plus the rise of fancy pet product websites, he says. An army of pet experts, behaviorists and designers is looking for ways to make dogs and cats sleep and play more comfortably, stylishly and safely.  "The choices available to pet owners today did not exist even a few years ago," says Steve King, chief executive of the American Pet Products Association.  Jackson Cunningham, founder of Tuft + Paw, just got back from Italy, where he was sourcing partners to develop designer cat furniture. His three-year-old company has appealed to fussy feline owners with sleek gray scratching towers and retro birch litter box furniture.  "Making pet furniture is very interesting because...</description>

      <title>Behind the scenes of night Trump partied at Mar-a-Lago with Epstein, NFL cheerleaders...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Behind-the-scenes-of-the-night-Trump-partied-at-14103852.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Donald Trump was coming off a bruising few years: His casino and real estate business had teetered on the edge of collapse, awash in debt. His marriage to Ivana Trump had disintegrated, and his relationship with model Marla Maples had fallen apart.  In November 1992, eager for a comeback, Trump threw a raucous party with NFL cheerleaders at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and invited NBC to tape the event.  Footage of that party, unearthed and aired by NBC News on Wednesday, shows Trump grabbing dancing cheerleaders and socializing with financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last week and charged with sex trafficking.  Trump has repeatedly said that he is "not a fan" of Epstein's and that the two had a falling out about 15 years ago. Epstein, who owns a home in Palm Beach near Mar-a-Lago, pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.  "I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him," the president said of Epstein this month. "He was a fixture in Palm Beach."  In the video from the 1992 party, the two men appear chummy, chuckling as Trump appears to point out women on the dance floor. At one point, Trump can be seen whispering in Epstein's ear, causing the financier to double over in laughter.  The footage was taken for a feature on Trump that aired on the NBC talk show "A Closer Look" that month. On the segment, host Faith Daniels described Trump's agreeing to come on the show after he kissed the news anchor on the lips in front of photographers at a charity dinner in New York while her husband's back was turned.  Trump's interactions with women at the Mar-a-Lago party - welcome or not - provides visual evidence of the kind of behavior he would later brag about on a 2005 "Access Hollywood" recording that surfaced at the end of the presidential...</description>
