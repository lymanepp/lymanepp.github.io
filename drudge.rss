      <title>DEMS: NO wall money...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/51dd72d6d19e4d2eb0b73dcd2c45aa27</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the U.S. government shutdown (all times local): 11:45 a.m. House Democrats are unveiling legislation to re-open the government without money for President Donald Trump's border wall. The House is preparing to vote on the package Thursday when the new Congress convenes. This is according to an aide who was not authorized to discuss the plan publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. It will include one bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8, with $1.3 billion for border security. The package will also include six other bipartisan bills to fund the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Housing and Urban Development and others closed by the partial shutdown. Some have already passed the Senate. Those bills will provide money through the remainder of the fiscal year, to Sept. 30. The partial government shutdown is in its second week over Trump's demand for $5 billion for the wall. --Lisa Mascaro</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Monday took the first major step toward launching a widely anticipated campaign for the presidency, hoping her reputation as a populist fighter can help her navigate a Democratic field that could include nearly two dozen candidates. "No matter what our differences, most of us want the same thing," the 69-year-old Massachusetts Democrat said in a video that highlights her family's history in Oklahoma. "To be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules and take care of the people we love. That's what I'm fighting for and that's why today I'm launching an exploratory committee for president."</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Nancy Pelosi often quotes Abraham Lincoln saying public sentiment is everything. It's a theory that will be put to the test when the new House Democratic majority gavels in this week and votes to end the government shutdown without money for President Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico. The high-stakes move to reopen the government will be the first big battle between Trump and Pelosi as Democrats come into control ready to reassert the power of the legislative branch and confront the White House.</description>

      <title>J.D. Salinger at 100: 'CATCHER IN RYE' still relevant?</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Is-Catcher-in-the-Rye-still-relevant-on-13499289.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Catcher in the Rye By J.D. Salinger Little, Brown. 240 pp. $8.99 - - - Tuesday is J.D. Salinger's 100th birthday, but Holden Caulfield is still 17. The iconic teenager of "The Catcher in the Rye" is forever suspended in the amber of our youthful alienation. Although a few pious schools continue to ban Salinger's only published novel, for millions of adults, a faded copy of "The Catcher in the Rye" is a sweet teenage treasure, as transgressive as a trophy from band camp. Ninth-graders who secretly read the book with a flashlight when it came out in 1951 are now in their 80s. To read it again as an adult is to feel Holden's pain lingering like a phantom limb. His righteous cynicism is adolescence distilled into a sweet liquor.</description>

      <title>'DREAMERS' ON TABLE?</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/ce26f76f37bd41bca5fa97ada7e6a4cf</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Three confidantes of President Donald Trump, including his departing chief of staff, are indicating that the president's signature campaign pledge to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border would not be fulfilled as advertised. Trump sparked fervent chants of "Build that wall!" at rallies before and after his election and more recently cited a lack of funding for a border wall as the reason for partially shutting down the government.
