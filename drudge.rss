      <title>As smartphones begin using scanned IDs, skeptics cite glitches, misuse, growing surveillance culture...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/As-smartphones-begin-using-scanned-IDs-skeptics-14837311.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashton Hickey appreciates some of the advanced features on her iPhone 8, like wireless charging and a camera that shoots high-definition 4K video.  But there's one she refuses to use: the fingerprint sensor that lets people access their phones with a single touch. Instead, she continually enters her six-digit passcode.  "I can handle typing that in," said Hickey, a freelance locations coordinator for movies and television shows. And she wouldn't ever consider the facial recognition on the latest iPhones. "Like more and more tech, it's [something] potentially nefarious, disguised as a way to make our life easier."  Hickey is one of a small but passionate group of smartphone owners resisting the recent wave of biometric security features, such as Apple's facial recognition technology and Samsung's iris and facial scans. Instead, they're sticking with passcodes or unlock patterns to access their smartphones even as companies push biometrics as key selling points on the newest thousand-dollar devices.  Avoiding commercial biometric security could be an increasingly difficult feat in the future. Smartphone makers are sticking with the tech and say it is faster and safer to use than a passcode alone. Facial recognition as an ID is already being offered to consumers outside of phones, including at airport check-ins, sports stadiums and concerts.  Computer science experts who study biometrics predict there will only be more options in the coming years, such as voice or heart-rate detection, signature authentication and even devices that can tell who you are by the way you walk. The Pentagon is already working on tools for gait and heartbeat identification.  But the passcode holdouts say they are worried about people gaining access to their phones through faulty fingerprint or face-detection tools. They fret about the security of...</description>
