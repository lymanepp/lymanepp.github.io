      <title>Berkeley loves sanctuary label, but housing crisis testing liberal values...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Berkeley-loves-its-sanctuary-label-but-a-housing-13890080.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BERKELEY, Calif. - This eccentric Northern California enclave was a sanctuary long before the designation became a must-have merit badge for any left-leaning city.  Berkeley politicians proclaimed the place a refuge for Navy sailors resisting deployment to the Vietnam War nearly a half-century ago. It was the birth of a movement to protect the outcast - and, in some cases, the outlaw - from rules that this beat-of-its-own-drum city and its followers found immoral, most recently the deportation of undocumented immigrants.  But California's housing crisis is testing whether Berkeley can remain that kind of place.  Faced with sharp criticism from a changing population, city leaders have banned people from living in recreational vehicles here, proving that even the most accepting of cities is not immune to the demands that often accompany wealth and gentrification. Businesses and residents have complained about the RVs' blighting of city streets and the burden they place on public safety and sanitation services.  "We had to do something," said Mayor Jesse Arreguín, referring to the March city council vote. "The ordinance we passed, I will admit we rushed into it. But we were facing a lot of pressure from businesses and residents."  The outcry over the ban was instant. The anger came from progressive neighbors such as Oakland, which feared that a scores-long caravan of RVs would soon head across the invisible city limits to its streets. The council suspended the law's enforcement until a more collective approach to the borderless problem might be found.  But Berkeley's move serves as a parable for how one seemingly small government decision and a lack of basic coordination can rumble through a region short on housing and high on frustration. The ban was itself a reaction to steps larger cities and the state have taken that...</description>

      <title>Officials fighting measles outbreaks threaten rare air travel ban...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Officials-fighting-US-measles-outbreaks-threaten-13884328.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Health officials in five states have warned people believed to be infected with measles and planning to travel that a federal regulation could prevent them from boarding planes.  All eight individuals agreed to cancel their flights after learning the government could place them on the "do not board list" managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Martin Cetron, director of the agency's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, which tracks disease outbreaks.  "The deterrent effect is huge," even in cases like these where the government's authority was not invoked, Cetron said. The agency had been contacted about the individuals by health officials from New York, California, Illinois, Texas and Washington state, CDC officials said.  Officials are often reluctant to talk about the government's travel ban authority "because it is a politically charged and politically visible request," said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health policy at Georgetown University.  The step is less restrictive than other public health measures like isolation or quarantine, but it "is seen as a government using its power over the people and the states, which is kind of toxic in America right now," said Gostin. "There is nothing unethical or wrong about it. It's just plain common sense that if you have an actively infectious individual, they should not get on an airplane."  Health officials emphasize that vaccination is the best and most effective way to protect against measles and that the majority of people with infectious, communicable diseases, like measles, listen to doctors' advice to not travel.  But for those who insist on traveling, federal authorities can use the list, which is managed by the CDC.  Officials in Rockland County, New York, and New York City, at...</description>

      <title>CASE TESTS FIRST AMENDMENT LIMITS</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Assange-charged-with-violating-Espionage-Act-13882846.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Federal prosecutors on Thursday accused WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange of violating the Espionage Act, bringing against him a new, 18-count indictment alleging that he unlawfully obtained and disclosed national defense information.  The new charges dramatically raise the stakes of the case both for Assange and the news media, raising questions about the limits of the First Amendment and protections for publishers of classified information.  Prosecutors say Assange worked with a former Army intelligence analyst to obtain and disseminate classified information - conduct of which many traditional reporters might also be accused. Prosecutors, though, sought to distinguish the anti-secrecy advocate from a traditional reporter.  "Julian Assange is no journalist," said John Demers, the Justice Department's Assistant Attorney General for National Security. He said Assange engaged in "explicit solicitation of classified information."  Assange was previously indicted by a U.S. grand jury over his interactions in 2010 with Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst who shared hundreds of thousands of classified war logs and diplomatic papers with WikiLeaks. If convicted, Assange would face a maximum of five years in prison under that conspiracy charge. The new charges carry with them a maximum possible sentence of 170 years in prison.  The new charges against Assange carry potential consequences not just for him but for others who publish classified information, and they could lead to a change in the delicate balance in U.S. law between press freedom and government secrecy. They also raises fresh questions about whether the British courts will view the new charges as justified and worthy of extradition.  Prosecutors say in the new indictment that Assange and WikiLeaks "repeatedly encouraged sources with...</description>

      <title>FACEBOOK fake account removal doubles to 3 billion...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Facebook-removes-3B-fake-accounts-but-how-many-13881859.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Facebook removed more than 3 billion fake accounts from October to March, twice as many as the previous six months, the company said Thursday.  Nearly all of them were caught before they had a chance to become "active" users of the social network.  In a new report, Facebook said it saw a "steep increase" in the creation of abusive, fake accounts. While most of these fake accounts were blocked "within minutes" of their creation, the company said this increase of "automated attacks" by bad actors meant not only that it caught more of the fake accounts, but that more of them slipped through the cracks.  As a result, the company estimates that 5% of its 2.4 billion monthly active users are fake accounts, or about 119 million. This is up from an estimated 3% to 4% in the previous six-month report.  The increase shows the challenges Facebook faces in removing accounts created by computers to spread spam, fake news and other objectionable material. Even as Facebook's detection tools get better, so do the efforts by the creators of these fake accounts.  The new numbers come as the company grapples with challenge after challenge, ranging from fake news to Facebook's role in elections interference, hate speech and incitement to violence in the U.S., Myanmar, India and elsewhere.  Facebook also said Thursday that it removed more than 7 million posts, photos and other material because it violated its rules against hate speech.  Facebook employs thousands of people to review posts, photos, comments and videos for violations. Some things are also detected without humans, using artificial intelligence. Both humans and AI make mistakes and Facebook has been accused of political bias as well as ham-fisted removals of posts discussing - rather than promoting -...</description>
