      <title>Brady no longer playing like elite QB...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Tom-Brady-is-no-longer-playing-like-an-elite-14846713.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The New England Patriots are at the top of the AFC with a 9-1 record. The Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas has them as the favorites to win the Super Bowl. Their defense is historically good. The game charters at Pro Football Focus rank New England's special teams as the second best of 2019.  The offense, however, has been underwhelming. The Patriots are averaging just two points per drive in 2019, the fifth lowest rate for the franchise since coach Bill Belichick took over in 2000. They're struggling in the red zone (49%, ranking 25th) and in goal-to-go situations (65%, 21st).  "The strength of our team is our defense and our special teams," quarterback Tom Brady told "The Greg Hill Show" Monday morning on WEEI. "On offense we just have to take advantage when we get opportunities and understand where our strengths lie and try and play to them - not giving any short fields, not turning the ball over and try and take advantage when we get into the red area to score touchdowns. That is kind of where our offense is. That is kind of where our team is."  Brady, remarkably, appears to be at the heart of the team's offensive futility. The future Hall of Famer completed 26 of 47 passes for 216 yards and no touchdowns on Sunday, the first time in Brady's 20-year career that he played an entire game and didn't lead the team in touchdown passes, according to ESPN's Stats &amp; Information. Wide receiver Julian Edelman threw New England's only touchdown pass, a 15-yarder to Phillip Dorsett in the third quarter. Brady also had 14 incompletions in the first half against Philadelphia, a career high.  You could wave this off as a one-game clunker, but Brady, who turned 42 in August, has been trending down for a few seasons. His completion rate is on a three-year decline, from close to a career high in 2016 (67%) to one of the lowest...</description>

      <title>How Kanye put Osteen's prosperity gospel back under spotlight...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/How-Kanye-West-put-Joel-Osteen-s-prosperity-14846529.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A performance by artist Kanye West at Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church in Houston on Sunday has launched a debate among Christians over controversial prosperity gospel teachings and the role of race in conservative evangelicalism.  "Kanye West and Joel Osteen are a match made in market-driven heaven," said Jonathan Walton, dean of Wake Forest Divinity School, who noted how West sold $170 "Jesus is King" sweatshirts with his new album.  "Both have baptized their commercial notoriety and their financial gains in Jesus' name," Walton said. "The communion table has become a merch table."  West's recent album "Jesus is King" has earned praise in unusual corners of conservative Christianity, but his comments have raised eyebrows over their association with Osteen's controversial prosperity gospel teachings, the idea that God grants health and wealth to his followers. Some Christians are also questioning whether black hip-hop artists are being used by white evangelicals preachers to boost their own brand and falsely signal progressive racial attitudes.  "Jesus has won the victory. Now, I told you about my arrogance and cockiness already. Now, the greatest artist that God has ever created is now working for him," West told Osteen on Sunday.  The prosperity gospel has seen a boost under President Donald Trump, who has included in his administration the televangelist Paula White, who promotes those teachings.  West and Osteen are part of a "show-and-tell" prosperity gospel movement in Christianity which says that God uses people to show he blesses them, said Kate Bowler, author of the book "Blessed: A History of the American Prosperity Gospel."  "Kanye's unbreakable confidence that he is the greatest artist on the planet could not have found a better theological home," Bowler said....</description>

      <title>Implicates Pompeo on Ukraine pressure campaign...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/879615/sondland-reportedly-kept-pompeo-loop-about-ukraine-pressure-campaign</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland made Secretary of State Mike Pompeo aware of a Ukraine pressure campaign, The New York Times reports. Sondland is set to testify Wednesday and face further questions in the impeachment inquiry about an effort to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations that might benefit President Trump politically, including involving former Vice President Joe Biden. Pompeo, according to the report, was informed by Sondland in mid-August "about a draft statement" he and another diplomat had worked on with Ukrainians "that they hoped would persuade Mr. Trump to grant Ukraine's new president the Oval Office meeting he was seeking." At the time, Sondland was negotiating a statement that would have Ukraine committing to an investigation of Burisma, the gas company where Biden's son served on the board, and the 2016 election. Additionally, the Times reports Sondland discussed the idea with Pompeo of pushing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky "to pledge during a planned meeting with Mr. Trump in Warsaw that he would take the steps being sought by Mr. Trump as a way to break the logjam in relations between the two countries." Although the Times notes it's "not clear how specific" Sondland was with Pompeo about "what was being asked of the Ukrainians," Pompeo by this point would have already heard Trump's July phone call with Zelensky, during which the president makes clear that he wants the country to conduct investigations into Biden and the 2016 election. This report is breaking just as Sondland's testimony before Congress is about to get underway. Brendan Morrow</description>

      <title>DRAMA: Witness reverses testimony, implicates EU ambassador...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/879521/kurt-volker-changes-past-testimony-admits-sondland-brought-biden-investigations-meeting-ukraine</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker has one big revision to his first impeachment testimony. In his original closed-door testimony, when asked if there was any talk of investigating the Bidens in a July 10 meeting with a Ukrainian defense leader, Volker repeatedly answered "no." But when appearing publicly before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, Volker reversed that statement. In his lengthy opening statement Tuesday, Volker mentioned meeting with then-National Security Adviser John Bolton, Ukraine's then-National Security and Defense, and other leaders. "I remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a generic comment about investigations," Sondland's new statement read, referring to U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and Trump's desired political investigations. "I think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue," Volker added. Flash back to last month when Volker was asked if there was any talk of Rudy Giuliani's desired Biden probe in that meeting. Volker didn't even let the questioner finish before answering "no" three times in a row. Volker also made another change to his previous testimony, saying that while he didn't tell Ukraine there were conditions to receive U.S. aid, he "did not know" if others "were conveying a different message to them around that same time."
