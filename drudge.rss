      <title>Tom Brady and PATRIOTS appear vulnerable. Do you want to bet against them? </title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Tom-Brady-and-the-Patriots-appear-vulnerable-Do-14947304.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - Maybe this is really it for those flat-voweled, hard-shelled New England Patriots. Maybe. Go ahead and mark it as the end of an era in pro football if you're sure, absolutely sure, that 42-year-old Tom Brady is finished defying normal cellular degeneration, and 67-year-old head coach Bill Belichick can't muster enough steel and nerve from his guys for one more postseason run. What shall we call their two decades of dominion, if it is indeed complete? An age?  With that peculiar, characteristic, tight-lipped existential state of denial known as their Way, they plodded through meetings and practice this week, affecting total unconcern about their past or future, betraying not a shred of sentimentality over the possibility that their wild-card meeting with the Tennessee Titans could be a closing chapter, and the final home game of Brady's career as a Patriot. "I'm not much for nostalgia," Brady said.  You don't win 78 percent of your games over 10 years by studying yesterday's scores, or tomorrow's predictions, or listening to the skeptics who've been saying you're past it for a decade. Or by dwelling on a season-ending loss to the Miami Dolphins so startling that, combined with Brady's age, impending free agency and uncertain future, it made the Patriots seem suddenly more faded and vulnerable than usual, maybe even underdogs against a surging team radiating the fresh strength of youth in the Titans.  "I don't know what we are, or aren't," Belichick said. "We're past last week. We're past every week."  People go to ashrams and consult sages for that kind of be-here-nowness. The thing is, the Patriots actually practice it. If they have shown one quality over the past 20 years, it's concentration in the face of threat. That unwaveringness is hard to properly appreciate; the numbers boggle. They've...</description>
