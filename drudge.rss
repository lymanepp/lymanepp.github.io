      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/opinion/article/Independents-are-pulling-away-from-Trump-14812116.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MANCHESTER, N.H. - The latest Washington Post-ABC News poll has some seriously troubling news for President Donald Trump: A year out from the 2020 election, he is hemorrhaging the support he once enjoyed from independents.  If it hadn't been for voters who claim no party affiliation, Trump most likely would not be in the White House today.  In 2016, he carried independents by four percentage points across the country, according to the National Election Pool exit poll. But in the states that mattered most, independents pulled him across the finish line. For instance, in Michigan, which had the nation's closest contest, Trump won independents by 16 percentage points over Hillary Clinton.  So which Democrat is best positioned to benefit from the disenchantment that many of these less partisan voters are feeling about the Trump presidency?  Three months ago, the answer was clear. Former vice president Joe Biden was the only Democratic contender who beat Trump - by a narrow seven percentage points - among independents in a theoretical head-to-head matchup in the Post poll.  But in the latest survey, five of the most talked-about Democratic candidates are besting Trump with independents. Biden has expanded his lead over the president to 17 points, while Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., do nearly as well, each leading the president by 16 points among independents. They favor Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., over Trump by 11 points, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 10 points.  In other words, the poll suggests that independents are increasingly willing to vote for a Democrat, no matter which of the most likely possibilities the party nominates. It also erodes to an erosion in Biden's chief selling point, which is that he is the most...</description>

      <title>INDEPENDENTS SHIFT LEFT</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-trails-Democratic-rivals-in-national-survey-14810165.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One year from the 2020 election, President Donald Trump trails some potential Democratic rivals in head-to-head matchups, with his national support level fixed at about 40 percent, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.  The new poll highlights the degree to which most of the country already has made a judgment about the president's performance and its voting preferences next year. Among the 39 percent of registered voters who approve of Trump's job performance, Trump is winning at least 95 percent support against each of five possible Democratic opponents. But among the 58 percent of voters who disapprove of Trump, he receives no more than 7 percent of support.  Former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., run strongest against the president nationally, with Biden leading by 17 points (56 percent to 39 percent), Warren by 15 points (55 percent to 40 percent) and Sanders by 14 points (55 percent to 41 percent).  South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., the other two Democrats tested against Trump, also lead the president among registered voters, with Buttigieg up by 52 percent to 41 percent, and Harris ahead by 51 percent to 42 percent.  The poll reflects national findings; other surveys in the states expected to play an outsize role in the 2020 contest have shown tighter races, particularly in parts of the Upper Midwest that Trump flipped from Democrats in 2016.  Nonetheless, the national results represent a shift away from Trump since the summer, when only Biden had a clear advantage over the incumbent. With Republicans and Democrats mostly locked into their voting intentions, the biggest difference between the results from July and those in the new poll is that independents have moved in the direction of the Democratic...</description>
