      <title>One question still dogs Trump: Why not try harder to solve crisis?</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/One-question-still-dogs-Trump-Why-not-try-harder-15436174.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both President Donald Trump's advisers and operatives laboring to defeat him increasingly agree on one thing: The best way for him to regain his political footing is to wrest control of the coronavirus.  In the six months since the deadly contagion was first reported in the United States, Trump has demanded the economy reopen and children return to school, all while scrambling to salvage his reelection campaign.  But both allies and opponents agree he has failed at the one task that could help him achieve all of his goals - confronting the pandemic with a clear strategy and consistent leadership.  Trump's shortcomings have perplexed even some of his most loyal allies, who increasingly have wondered why the president has not at least pantomimed a sense of command over the crisis or conveyed compassion for the millions of Americans impacted by it.  People close to Trump, many speaking anonymously to share candid discussions and impressions, say the president's inability to wholly address the crisis is due to his almost pathological unwillingness to admit error; a positive feedback loop of overly rosy assessments and data from advisers and Fox News; and a penchant for magical thinking that prevented him from fully engaging with the pandemic.  In recent weeks, with more than 146,000 Americans now dead from the virus, the White House has attempted to overhaul - or at least rejigger - its approach. The administration has revived news briefings led by Trump himself and presented the president with projections showing how the virus is now decimating Republican states full of Trump voters. Officials have also set up a separate, smaller coronavirus working group led by Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, along with Trump son-in-law and senior adviser...</description>

Young children with dogs have fewer social interaction problems than others...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Young-children-with-pet-dogs-seen-having-fewer-15436310.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young children with family dogs were 23 percent less likely to have social interaction problems than children whose households do not have a dog, some recent research suggests.  The finding comes from an analysis of data from a three-year study of 1,646 households with preschool children ages 2 to 5. Specifically, the researchers found that children who had a dog were 30 percent less likely to engage in antisocial behavior and 40 percent less likely to have problems interacting with other children than were youngsters from homes that did not include a dog.  In addition, children who had dogs were 34 percent more likely to engage in considerate behaviors, such as sharing or helping others. And the more time they spent playing with their dog the more a child was likely to be considerate - those who had three or more play sessions with their dog each week were 74 percent more likely to be consistently considerate compared with those who played less often.  One of the researchers said that the "mere presence of a family dog was associated with many positive behaviors and emotions." The study also noted that the "findings suggest that the benefits from owning a pet (dog) may commence early in childhood." The research did not, however, prove a cause-and-effect link between a dog and a child's behavior, stating that it could be coincidental that youngsters with good social and emotional development have dogs or that the families of children with dogs may offer more nurturing...</description>

      <title>2020 is summer of booming home sales -- and evictions...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/business/article/2020-is-the-summer-of-booming-home-sales-and-15436167.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Realtor James Dietsche, there is only one way to describe the real estate market right now: "It's insane."  A 1950s style three-bedroom home he listed in late June for $200,000 in a small town outside Harrisburg, Pa., received 26 offers the initial weekend it was for sale. Many buyers were young couples seeking a starter home and retirees looking to downsize. But bids also came from Philadelphia, New York City and the Washington, D.C., area. One person was willing to pay up to $50,000 above asking. Several were offering to buy it without inspections.  While Dietsche's cellphone has been ringing with eager buyers, Tammy Steen's phone has been buzzing for a different reason. Her landlord keeps calling demanding the $700 rent she does not have. Steen, 52, was a hotel housekeeper at a Hampton Inn in Pensacola, Fla. Her temporary layoff now looks permanent. She has yet to receive unemployment aid despite applying in late March. She has applied to countless fast food, retail and maid jobs but has not been hired. She has started selling hot dogs on the side of the road to beachgoers, praying she does not become homeless.  The coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating inequities across America, especially in housing. This summer is one of the best times for home buyers and worst for many renters. Americans with money in the bank are buying bigger homes, while renters increasingly worry about eviction.  Nearly 15 million homes sold nationwide in April, May and June, according to new data released this week by the Commerce Department and National Association of Realtors. Meanwhile, 12.6 million renters say they were unable to pay rent last month, according to the latest Household Pulse survey from the U.S. Census.  Homes sales are booming, because Americans who have savings, stable jobs and good credit scores are taking advantage...</description>
