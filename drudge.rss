      <title>Nunes could face second ethics investigation... </title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Rep-Devin-Nunes-could-face-second-ethics-14858221.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A high-ranking House Democrat said Saturday it's "quite likely" Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., will face an ethics investigation over allegations that he met with an ex-Ukrainian official to obtain information about former vice president Joe Biden and his son.  Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, appeared on MSNBC where he was asked whether Nunes could face a House inquiry. "Quite likely, without question," Smith said.  The allegation that Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, met with a former Ukrainian prosecutor last year to discuss the Bidens came from the attorney for Lev Parnas, one of two Soviet-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were indicted on charges they broke campaign finance law.  Parnas' attorney, Joseph Bondy, told The Washington Post that Ukraine's former top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, informed Parnas that he had met with Nunes in Vienna in December 2018.  Bondy also said that a top aide to Nunes, Derek Harvey, sometimes joined a group that met frequently in spring 2019 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, District of Columbia, to discuss the Biden matter among other topics. The group, according to Bondy, was convened by Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, and included Parnas, his business associate Igor Fruman, as well as journalist John Solomon and the married legal team of Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing.  The information about Nunes' meeting with Shokin and Harvey's meetings with Giuliani were first reported by CNN on Friday.  Nunes declined to comment. He did, however, strongly push back on the story to the conservative outlet Breitbart News and threatened to sue CNN for reporting it. He also threatened to sue the Daily Beast for a story...</description>
