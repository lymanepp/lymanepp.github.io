      <title>CA Upends College Sports; Will Allow Athletes to Make Money...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/education/article/California-to-let-college-athletes-make-money-14478603.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Defying the NCAA, California's governor signed a first-in-the-nation law Monday that will let college athletes hire agents and make money from endorsements - a move that could upend amateur sports in the U.S. and trigger a legal challenge.  Under the law, which takes effect in 2023, students at public and private universities in the state will be allowed to sign deals with sneaker companies, soft drink makers or other advertisers and profit from their names and likenesses, just like the pros.  Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and others cast the law as an attempt to bring more fairness to big-money college sports and let athletes share in the wealth they create for their schools.  "Other college students with a talent, whether it be literature, music, or technological innovation, can monetize their skill and hard work," he said. "Student athletes, however, are prohibited from being compensated while their respective colleges and universities make millions, often at great risk to athletes' health, academics and professional careers."  Newsom tweeted a video showing him signing the law during a special episode of HBO's "The Shop: Uninterrupted" alongside NBA superstar LeBron James and other athletes.  He predicted other states will introduce similar legislation. Two lawmakers in South Carolina have already announced plans to do so.  The new law applies to all sports, though the big money to be made is in football and basketball. It bars schools from kicking athletes off the team if they get paid. It does not apply to community colleges and prohibits athletes from accepting endorsement deals that conflict with their schools' existing contracts.  The NCAA, which had asked Newsom to veto the bill, responded by saying it will consider its "next steps"...</description>

      <title>Bolton rebukes Trump on NKorea; Says Kim won't give up nukes...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Bolton-rebukes-Trump-on-North-Korea-says-Kim-14479304.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former White House national security adviser John Bolton on Monday offered a pointed rebuke to President Donald Trump's diplomatic outreach to North Korea, warning that leader Kim Jong has no intention of relinquishing his nuclear weapons and arguing U.S. sanctions are not being effectively enforced.  In his first extended public remarks since being ousted by Trump last month over policy disagreements, Bolton offered a starkly pessimistic and ominous view of Pyongyang's intentions after Kim's three meetings with Trump over the past 15 months.  North Korea "has not made a strategic decision to give up their nuclear weapons. I think the contrary is true," Bolton said during remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The strategic decision Kim Jong Un has made is to do whatever he can to keep nuclear weapons capability and development."  Trump has touted the North's nearly two-year moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles as a sign of the Kim regime's good-faith negotiations. But Bolton made clear that he believes Pyongyang's multiple tests of short-range missiles over the summer constitute a violation long-standing U.N. Security Council resolutions.  He added that moratorium on nuclear testing "tells us nothing about North Korea's intentions or strategy."  The North will "never give up enough voluntarily for me," Bolton said, noting that it would require Kim to agree to an "inspection system so robust and thorough they may well think it threatens the viability of their regime."  Trump cut ties with Bolton after the two clashed over the latter's hard line, confrontational stance on North Korea and Iran, which was largely at odds with the president's interest in negotiating over the nuclear weapons programs of both countries. After Bolton resigned, Trump...</description>

      <title>Biden ads disappear...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/868657/joe-biden-barely-advertising-online-anymore</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden is missing in action. The former vice president's seemingly untouchable polling lead has been leapfrogged a handful of times over the past few weeks, namely by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). That would imply that it's time for Biden to double down and reach out to more voters, but his online advertising is suggesting he's doing the opposite, The New York Times reports. In the month leading up to the September Democratic debate, Biden spent just $32,000 on Facebook ads, per the Times. That's less than five candidates who didn't make the stage spent, and less than two candidates who dropped out during that time. It's also a huge plunge from the $1.2 million Biden spent on Facebook and Google ads in the first two weeks after his April campaign launch. Instead, Biden has shifted his ad spending to TV ads â€” a move that Zac Moffatt, who ran Mitt Romney's digital operations, said "reeks of desperation." "You are spending at least a third to half your life on your mobile phone, and they're deciding they don't need to have a message for you there," Moffatt told the Times. Meanwhile, Sen. Cory Booker's (D-N.J.) 2020 campaign has a bit of good news: It hit its $1.7 million fundraising goal for 2019's third fundraising quarter, from July to September. If that didn't happen, Booker says he would've ended his campaign. Still, that's nowhere near the totals top-tier candidates raised during the second quarter, and only about a third of Booker's Q2 total of $4.5 million. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>WASH POST: President Pelosi?</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/President-Pelosi-It-could-happen-14478559.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happens when a Democratic speaker of the House - third in line to the presidency, according to the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 - is suddenly thrust into the Oval Office, succeeding a Republican president and vice president who resign, embroiled in scandal?  Such a scenario is attracting attention - #PresidentPelosi was trending on social media after last week's announcement of an impeachment inquiry - even though it may seem far-fetched that President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence would be forced from office over abuse of power related to the administration's dealings with Ukraine or other misdeeds.  This was a more urgent question in the fall of 1973. On Oct. 10, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned, pleading nolo contendere to charges of tax evasion. Ten days later, President Richard Nixon ordered the firing of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox in what is widely known as the Saturday Night Massacre. As hearings began in the Senate and the House on the nomination of Agnew's successor, Gerald Ford, questions swirled about the possibility that Democratic House Speaker Carl Albert, D-Okla., might assume the presidency.  So real was the possibility that Ted Sorensen, a speechwriter and close adviser to President John F. Kennedy, wrote a secret 19-page memorandum to Albert, offering recommendations for what to do and what to say in the event that Nixon resigned before Ford could be confirmed and Albert suddenly found himself sitting in the Oval Office. Although long forgotten, the memo is timely in this chaotic political moment, when a Pelosi presidency, however improbable, is not impossible. It reminds us that our faith in representative self-governance may yet be salvaged.  With the country facing uncharted territory - the only impeachment in American history had come more than a century...</description>

      <title>Inside new UBER: Weak coffee, vanishing perks, fast-deflating morale...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Inside-the-new-Uber-Weak-coffee-vanishing-perks-14478225.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN FRANCISCO - Tech IPOs have long been viewed as a boon for Silicon Valley workers, ushering in a new era of corporate stability and stock-driven wealth.  That's not been the case at Uber, where the stock price has fallen roughly 30 percent since going public in May and employees say they've noticed cuts to amenities as basic as the brands of coffee available for brewing.  Uber is changing as it shifts from a closely held unicorn start-up to a publicly traded company that appears to be losing investors' confidence, according to interviews with current and former workers. Those changes include laying off more than 800 workers over the summer.  Meanwhile, stock units are valued at a fraction of what many employees were led to believe. And executives are imposing workflow changes aimed at improving the company's efficiency, adjustments that strike some employees as stifling innovation.  "We need to ship more quickly and operate more effectively and efficiently than we are today," Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a recent company email following the announcement of engineering and product team layoffs. "We are not doing this for Wall Street. We are doing this for Uber. It's critical we get our edge back and continually push ourselves to do better."  Uber was the second of what was supposed to be a blockbuster summer of public offerings. But many haven't gone as expected, raising questions about a potential tech bubble. Rival Lyft was the first. Its stock price plunged in the days following its $72-per-share opening, rounding out the summer more than 40 percent below that price. WeWork, which was set to go public this month, was forced to postpone its IPO date amid billions in losses and conflicts of interest for its embattled chief executive, who stepped down from that role Tuesday.  In fact, the wave of 2018 and 2019...</description>
