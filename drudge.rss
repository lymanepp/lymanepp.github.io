      <title>Discontent with McCarthy rises as GOP considers post-Trump world...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Discontent-with-McCarthy-rises-as-GOP-considers-a-15483529.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Discontent with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is on the rise in the House, as Republicans increasingly fearful of a loss by President Donald Trump on Election Day gear up for an intraparty war over the future of the GOP.  A cluster of GOP lawmakers is starting to privately question whether the California Republican is putting loyalty to the president over the good of the conference. And there is a small group of members discussing whether someone should challenge him for minority leader if Trump is defeated Nov. 3.  The matter bubbled to the surface this week with the primary election of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a fringe House candidate in Georgia who espouses the QAnon conspiracy theory and has made numerous racist comments. Multiple Republicans implored McCarthy to help defeat her by supporting her primary opponent. But McCarthy refused, phoning the candidate in an apparent peace accord before the primary, while Trump embraced her on Twitter this week as a "future Republican Star."  However, the frustration with McCarthy had already been brewing for weeks as Trump's polling has sagged behind presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. According to interviews with more than 10 House Republicans - all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to be frank - some GOP lawmakers are worried that McCarthy has tied the conference too much to Trump, refusing to stand up to the president or act as a buffer to distinguish the conference from him.  Others are also furious that he didn't shield them from a recent Trump campaign demand that House members donate to the president's reelection effort.  "There's no doubt that McCarthy is a Trump loyalist, through and through," said Doug Heye, a former House GOP leadership staffer who has known McCarthy personally for decades. "I think the challenge for everyone in the...</description>

      <title>BUNKER:  Secret Service sought tactical aircraft to protect White House amid Floyd demonstrations... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Secret-Service-sought-tactical-aircraft-to-15482671.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Secret Service sought to bolster its protection of the White House with surveillance aircraft and a Blackhawk helicopter carrying a "fast rope" commando team after crowds protesting the police killing of George Floyd knocked down temporary barricades and one man got onto the complex grounds in late May, according to newly obtained government correspondence.  That breach - combined with the throngs of protesters that converged outside the White House the night of May 29 - prompted agents to rush President Donald Trump to a reinforced bunker and spurred a deeper concern about the White House's vulnerability.  In a letter a week later, the Secret Service asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide aircraft that could be used in a rapid-response helicopter operation, the records show.  Customs and Border Protection ultimately provided the agency with live information from a surveillance plane, but the Secret Service determined that the helicopter was not necessary, according to administration officials familiar with the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.  Washington is the latest example of cities where CBP deployed surveillance aircraft in the skies in recent months to monitor demonstrations. In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed, a Predator drone was dispatched May 29. The agency's role has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and others who say such tactics infringe on privacy and free-speech rights.  In a June 5 letter, a top Secret Service official asked CBP for use of a Blackhawk helicopter equipped with special "fast ropes." The agency proposed the aircraft could be used to rapidly drop six tactical agents for emergency missions, to help officers under threat and to descend on crowds from overhead, according to government records.  The Secret...</description>

      <title>Recession over for rich, but working class far from recovered... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/business/article/The-recession-is-over-for-the-rich-but-the-15482561.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;U.S. stocks are hovering near a record high, a stunning comeback since March that underscores the new phase the economy has entered: The wealthy have mostly recovered. The bottom half remain far from it.  This dichotomy is evident in many facets of the economy, especially in employment. Jobs are fully back for the highest wage earners, but fewer than half the jobs lost this spring have returned for those making less than $20 an hour, according to a new labor data analysis by John Friedman, an economics professor at Brown University and co-director of Opportunity Insights.  Though recessions almost always hit lower-wage workers the hardest, the pandemic is causing especially large gaps between rich and poor, and between white and minority households. It is also widening the gap between big and small businesses. Some of the largest companies, such as Nike and Best Buy, are enjoying their highest stock prices ever while many smaller businesses fight for survival.  Some economists have started to call this a "K-shaped" recovery because of the diverging prospects for the rich and poor, and they say policy failures in Washington are exacerbating the problems.  Congress has not passed another relief bill, and the bulk of the federal stimulus originally passed in March to sustain small businesses and more than 28 million people on unemployment benefits has largely expired.  As talks between Republicans and Democrats in Washington have disintegrated, the burden of supporting the economy has fallen on the Federal Reserve, which has pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system to prop up businesses and markets, fueling a 50 percent gain in the stock market since March and a surge in home and car buying. But the Fed's main tools in this situation are reducing the benchmark interest rate and buying bonds. The Fed cannot give...</description>

      <title>Republicans divided how to best attack...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Trump-and-allies-struggle-to-find-a-focused-15479925.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - In her first 24 hours as the presumptive Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Kamala Harris was labeled "nasty" by President Donald Trump, "phony" by his reelection campaign and "a far-left radical" by his surrogates.  The messages emanating from Trump and his allies about the senator from California varied wildly - casting her as both an overzealous prosecutor too tough on crime and an advocate for defunding the police, and as being so far to the left she would institute socialism as well as too moderate to satisfy her party's progressive base.  Meanwhile, Trump's allies in conservative media road-tested an assault on Harris as soft on crime, an avatar of political correctness and a danger to the safety and security of American families. Some argued that she was not African American because her father emigrated from Jamaica and her mother from India, and repeatedly mispronounced her first name. And in the darker corners of social media, some of the attacks were more overtly misogynistic and racist.  All that was before Harris made her first public appearance on Wednesday afternoon alongside presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who made history Tuesday by selecting her as the nation's first Black and Asian American major-party candidate for vice president.  The blizzard of attacks against Harris from the political right illustrated the urgency Republicans feel to demonize her as a way for Trump to recover some of the ground he lost this spring and summer over his handling of the novel coronavirus. The scattershot nature of the intersecting lines of attack also underscored the lack of consensus within the GOP about how best to take on Harris.  "It's clear that they don't have a message on Kamala Harris, much like they haven't on Joe Biden. They are flailing," said Christina Reynolds, vice...</description>

      <title>Covid-19 death toll rivals fatality rate during 1918 flu epidemic, researchers claim...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Covid-19-death-toll-rivals-fatality-rate-during-15481277.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The increase in deaths in New York City during the early months of the covid-19 pandemic rivals the death toll there at the peak of the 1918 flu pandemic, according to an analysis published Thursday.  The comparison, published online in the medical journal JAMA Network Open, found that the number of deaths from all causes was roughly equal during the two peak months of the flu epidemic and the first 61 days of the current outbreak.  The H1N1 flu pandemic eventually killed 50 million people a century ago, about 675,000 of them in the United States. The current pandemic has claimed at least 746,000 lives worldwide, about 162,000 of them in the United States, according to a tally kept by The Washington Post.  "For anyone who doesn't understand the magnitude of what we're living through, this pandemic is comparable in its effect on mortality to what everyone agrees is the previous worst pandemic," said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who led the team that conducted the data review.  (The AIDS epidemic has killed more than 700,000 people in the United States since it began in 1981.)  There were 31,589 deaths from all causes in New York during the peak period of the flu epidemic, about the same as the 33,465 tallied in the 61 days after the first death on March 11 of this year, the analysis shows.  New York in 1918 had a population of 5.5 million people, so the death rate of 287 per 100,000 person-months was greater than the 202 of the current covid-19 pandemic. Person-months is a way of measuring the number of deaths in a population during a specific period of time.  But the current outbreak has seen a more dramatic rise in "excess deaths" - the number of fatalities above what would be expected in a normal year. With better medical...</description>

      <title> Iowa storm flattens 10 million acres of crops!</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/930959/hurricaneforce-storm-iowa-flattens-10-million-acres-crops</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A powerful derecho storm that swept through the Midwest on Monday has left thousands of acres of crops completely devastated, and officials say more than half a million people could be without power for quite a while. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) said the storm, which had hurricane-force winds up to 112 mph, destroyed at least one-third of the entire state's crops. More than 10 million acres were completely flattened, leading Reynolds to say she thinks the storm should qualify for federal disaster declaration. The Washington Post reports between 180 and 270 million bushels of corn were likely damaged, shortly before harvesting usually begins in September. The storm left one man dead in Iowa and one woman in Indiana. Teams are working to restore power, though USA Today reports full recovery could take weeks. Photos demonstrate just how dramatic and widespread the damage was: This is from around in Greene County, Iowa just NW of Perry Jim Smith the corn was suffering from the drought. Then we got a little rain last week. And now this. All eight of my corn fields look this flat and quite a bit of it snapped not just leaning. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/hFOTn1AZ7a â€” Jim Smith, Ph.D. (@JimSmith87) August 11, 2020 Continuing to see more and more pictures of the damage and it's devastating and unbelievable.
