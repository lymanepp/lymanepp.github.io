      <title>Biden likely to name his running mate in second week of August... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Biden-likely-to-name-his-running-mate-in-second-15450249.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden will most likely announce his running mate in the second week of August, again breaking a self-imposed deadline for unveiling the choice, according to two people familiar with his plans.  Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, initially said he'd select his running mate by Aug. 1. Then on Tuesday, he told reporters that he intended to make up his mind by the end of the first week of August, which would be Aug. 8.  "I'm going to have a choice in the first week in August," he said, "and I promise I'll let you know when I do."  But Friday, two people familiar with Biden's vice-presidential search process said the announcement is not likely to come next week.  There are political reasons for Biden to unveil the pick relatively shortly before the Aug. 17 kickoff of the Democratic National Convention, since that timing could add some excitement to the gathering while minimizing the opportunity for Republican attacks. Some Biden allies have been urging him to make the announcement around Aug. 10.  The former vice president has said he will pick a woman to be his running mate. He's also said that he's vetting four Black women for the role, and those close to the campaign say the list includes Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; former national security adviser Susan Rice; Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif.; and Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., confirmed Thursday that she's been vetted.  Others believed to be in contention are Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has become an informal economic policy adviser to Biden in recent months, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.  Making the announcement just a few days before the convention would allow Biden to build buzz for the party's quadrennial meeting, with less time for the Trump campaign to define...</description>

      <title>Patient didn't recognize body after double transplant...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/COVID-patient-didn-t-recognize-body-after-double-15447359.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHICAGO (AP) - A Chicago woman who last month became the nation's first COVID-19 patient to undergo a double lung transplant said Thursday that she woke up days later, unaware about the surgery and unable to "recognize my body."  Mayra Ramirez said that before she fell ill she was an independent, active person who moved from North Carolina to Chicago in 2014 to work as a paralegal. She said she had an autoimmune condition, but was otherwise healthy. She had gone on a three-mile run shortly before becoming ill and heading for the hospital.  "I was told to hurry up (and) change," she said. "I was asked who would be making my medical decisions for me. That's when I told them it would be my mother and eldest sister who all live in North Carolina. I only had a couple minutes to contact them to let them know what was going on before I was intubated."  Ramirez, 28, spoke to the media on Thursday alongside Brian Kuhns, 62, of Lake Zurich, Illinois, who followed her as the second U.S. coronavirus patient to undergo a double transplant.  Ramirez underwent the lung transplant on June 5 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. She didn't wake up until mid-June.  "I looked at myself and couldn't recognize my body," she said. "I didn't have the cognitive ability to process what was going on. All I knew was that I wanted water."  Dr. Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery and surgical director of the Northwestern Medicine Lung Transplant Program, said Ramirez, who was on a ventilator, fought for her life for six weeks, with the virus completely destroying her lungs. Doctors would call Nohemi Romero, her mother in North Carolina, with updates.  Ramirez, sitting next to her mother during a news conference at the hospital, said her family made the trip to...</description>

      <title>LeBron salutes Kaepernick for inspiring NBA National Anthem demonstration...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/LeBron-James-salutes-Colin-Kaepernick-for-15448572.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;KISSIMMEE, Fla. - After kneeling during the national anthem on the opening night of the NBA's bubble restart, LeBron James dedicated the coordinated social justice demonstration to former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  James, who led the Los Angeles Lakers past the Clippers at 103-101 at The Arena at Disney World on Thursday, said that Kaepernick "taught me a lot" about the protest issue. Kaepernick, once a star quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers, has not played in the NFL since he began protesting police brutality by taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016.  "I hope we made Kaep proud," James said. "I hope we continue to make Kaep proud every single day. I hope I make him proud on how I live my life, not only out on the basketball floor but off the floor."  The Lakers and Clippers donned "Black Lives Matter" shirts and locked arms before their contest in a unified demonstration. Every player on both teams participated, as did the coaches and referees. A similar demonstration took place involving members of the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans earlier Thursday.  The 35-year-old James, who has been outspoken on political issues dating back to Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner, called for the Louisville police officers who shot Breonna Taylor to be arrested last week. After praising Rep. John Lewis recently for teaching him to "never be afraid of conflict, good conflict, positive conflict that can create change," James said he appreciated Kaepernick's willingness to take a polarizing stand and to clearly state his motives, even when critics suggested that kneeling was disrespectful to the military or un-American.  "Kaep was someone who stood up when times weren't comfortable, when people didn't understand, when people refused to listen to what he was saying," James said. "If you go back and listen to his...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you've ever wondered what it would be like to wake up in 2020 after being in a coma for nearly four years, the Lincoln Project has you covered. The Lincoln Project, founded by Republicans who do not want to see President Trump re-elected, released its latest ad, 'Wake Up,' on Thursday. It opens with a man in a hospital bed being greeted by his family, who let him know he was in a car accident and has been in a coma for more than three years. 'Did I miss anything interesting?' he asks his masked family. A proud Trump voter, he starts peppering his Republican family with questions, like how did the president get Mexico to pay for his border wall? They catch him up to speed on about 0.01 percent of what has happened over the last few years, putting their own positive spin on the impeachment, the coronavirus pandemic, the Stormy Daniels saga, Trump throwing paper towels in Puerto Rico, and the economy. The man's reaction, while extreme, also feels pretty relatable. Watch the video below. Catherine Garcia</description>

      <title>MAG: Best argument against Kamala for VP...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/928426/best-argument-against-kamala-harris-vp</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is reportedly the frontrunner to be picked as Joe Biden's running mate. At a time of close attention to racial justice issues, the first Black woman vice president would be a marked symbolic advance. However, there is another side to Harris' record on this question. Alex Sammon examined documents from Harris' tenure as California attorney general for The American Prospect, and found that she disobeyed for years a Supreme Court order to reduce the extreme overcrowding in the state's prisons. Harris took office in 2011, and in May that year the court ruled the state's packed prisons â€” which had previously reached 200 percent of their design capacity â€” were a violation of the Eighth Amendment. They instructed the state to cut capacity to 167 percent by the end of 2011, to 137.5 percent by June 2013, and appointed a 3-judge oversight panel. Harris refused. The state made little progress in 2011, and in 2012 appealed to get the final figure raised to 145 percent (which was denied). By April 2013 the state was still 9,636 prisoners over the cap, and the oversight board recommended extending 'good time' credits to nonviolent offenders. Harris's office fought tooth and nail against this proposal. The judges found their arguments so 'continually equivocated regarding the facts and the law' that they nearly held the state in contempt of court. Eventually, in 2014, Harris gave in and the prison population was duly reduced. This stubborn foot-dragging to keep nonviolent, low-risk offenders in grossly overcrowded prisons bears a striking contrast with Harris's decision not to prosecute Steven Mnuchin (now secretary of the Treasury) for illegal foreclosures when he was head of OneWest Bank. As David Dayen reported at The Intercept, California prosecutors wrote a memo in 2013 describing how they 'uncovered evidence suggestive of widespread misconduct,' including 1,000 alleged legal violations in just a sample of OneWest loans. They recommended Harris file charges, but she declined to do so. So on the one hand, Harris went to the mat to keep thousands of nonviolent offenders behind bars. On the other, she would not prosecute a rich, well-connected person even when her own staffers found 1,000 alleged crimes. It's not a great fit for a time when the rampant injustice in American police departments and prisons has become a first-rank political issue. Ryan Cooper</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;After he tested positive for the coronavirus this month, Jose Freire Interian received strict orders to quarantine at his home in Key West, Fla. With infections exploding across the state, the sick 24-year-old was not to leave his bungalow and risk spreading the virus any further.  But on Wednesday, police showed up to his door, demanding that he and his wife leave their house - in handcuffs.  "I asked them, 'Why?' I was in shock," he told the Associated Press. "Why am I getting arrested for? It was unfair."  Officials allege that Freire and Yohana Gonzalez, 26, repeatedly ignored the quarantine orders - going to walk their dog, shop for groceries, and get their car washed - and had been caught on tape.  On Thursday, the couple was taken to the Stock Island Detention Center on two second-degree misdemeanor charges: breaking quarantine during a public health emergency and violating emergency management.  Authorities believe Freire and Gonzalez are the first people to be arrested for such an offense in Monroe County, and perhaps all of Florida, since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. But nationwide, they are hardly the only ones whose lax adherence to the rules has landed them in jail.  As the pandemic has spread across the United States, killing more than 148,000 people to date, police have on occasion locked up possible vectors of disease - those who are sick, or irresponsible, or both - to ensure the virus does not spread even further.  Earlier this month, a Kentucky woman and her husband were placed on house arrest after she refused to sign papers agreeing to quarantine herself. A man from New York was detained in South Carolina after he was discovered walking around in a hospital gown, just days after his trip down.  Hawaii, in particular, has taken a relentless...</description>
