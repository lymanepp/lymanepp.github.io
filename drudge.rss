      <title>Same-sex love scene was cut from movie on DELTA flights. So was word 'lesbian'...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/A-same-sex-love-scene-was-cut-from-a-movie-on-14637534.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Near the end of the 2019 film "Booksmart," a tense bathroom kiss between Amy, the film's timid, justice-minded lead, and Hope, her high school's "basic hot girl," turns into more: Hidden from a house party outside, they engage in a hookup that's been hailed as an unusually frank, on-screen portrayal of sex between two women.  But watch "Booksmart" on a Delta Air Lines flight, and the R-rated high school comedy will skip right through that scene. Reportedly, the in-flight cut also passes over the words "vagina" and "genitals," an exchange about a lesbian sex act, talk of a urinary tract infection, and a bit in which Amy and her friend watch porn in the back of a ride-share.  Amid calls of censorship, those edits - made by an outside company that works with the airline - are drawing the ire and confusion of passengers and Hollywood insiders alike, in what's at least the fourth instance when same-sex romance has been stripped from an in-flight Delta movie in recent years.  "If it's not X-rated, surely it's acceptable on an airplane," director Olivia Wilde said at an awards show on Sunday night. "There's insane violence of bodies being smashed in half [in other movies], and yet a love scene between two women is censored from the film. It's such an integral part of this character's journey. I don't understand it."  In a statement to The Washington Post early on Thursday, Delta said its "content parameters do not in any way ask for the removal of homosexual content from the film."  But it's not the first time the airline has come under fire for the situation - or, for that matter, even the only time this week. On Tuesday, other Delta passengers protested that the in-flight cut of "Rocketman," the Elton John biopic released this year, was missing sex scenes and even a chaste kiss between two men.  The same was true of "Carol,"...</description>

      <title>FACEBOOK reports record revenue...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Facebook-reports-record-revenue-14577228.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook shrugged off months of criticism from regulators and privacy experts Wednesday with record quarterly revenue, revealing advertisers are still flocking to the site.  Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said its third-quarter revenue grew by 29 percent to $17.7 billion. The company's revenue is driven almost entirely by advertising. Those numbers beat estimates from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence of $17.35 billion. Net profit grew 19 percent from the same period a year earlier to $6.1 billion.  The number of users on all of Facebook's platforms combined has grown more slowly than revenue. In the third quarter, monthly active users were up 8 percent to 2.45 billion year-over-year. The company's daily active user numbers beat expectations slightly with 9 percent growth year-over-year to 1.62 billion.  "Now we have a clear path forward, not just in terms of product and business but in terms of guidance from regulators which sets clear expectations and gives us a foundation to build on," chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said during a call with analysts.  On the earnings call, Zuckerberg said the company will continue to accept political ads, which he estimated will constitute 0.5 percent of the company's revenue next year. His comments came the same day Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced that the platform would ban all political ads, beginning in November.  Zuckerberg insisted that the policy is based on its commitment to free speech, not concerns about its bottom line. Democratic presidential candidates and others criticized Facebook this month for declining to remove a Trump campaign ad that contained falsehoods.  "In a democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians or the news," he said.  "This isn't about free...</description>

      <title>Trump without the Trumpiness would win reelection in landslide... </title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/opinion/article/Trump-without-the-Trumpiness-would-win-reelection-14575603.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A thought experiment: Imagine that the president of the United States was a man named Ronald Stump, not Donald Trump. Suppose he was known, before reaching the Oval Office, for delivering thoughtful remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations, rather than for starring in a cartoonish "reality" TV show. Picture him communicating through the White House press office instead of an inflammatory Twitter feed, and cool rather than fiery, and careful as opposed to rash.  Now give this anti-Trump, this Ronald Stump, the same record on which to run for reelection as our real-life President Trump. Give him a persistently strong stock market, record-low unemployment, tame inflation, below-average gasoline prices and bragging rights in a Delta Force raid to administer justice to the founder of the Islamic State. Add to that a passionately happy base of voters savoring a tax cut, a deregulation crusade and a growing army of conservative judges, as promised.  Ronald Stump would be riding high as he enters his reelection campaign. The markers of a two-term presidency are there: a growing economy, a happy political base, a chastened enemy. And given his background and temperament, Stump offends almost no one; he's a uniter, not a divider; he says "Yes, we can" and "Si, se puede." He is affirmative, inspiring. Minus the Trumpiness, President Stump would be thinking in terms of historical landslides.  Trump without the Trumpiness is a fantasy once cherished, but long abandoned, by the conflicted individuals formerly known as Republicans. They've reluctantly come to understand that chaos is intrinsic to this perpetual one-man news cycle. The cartoon-villain vibe, the crazy Twitter feed, the geopolitical rashness and the crude bully-boy are all so baked into Trump's personality that they will matter just as much (maybe more) over the...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;To quote everyone in President Trump's Twitter replies, "there's a tweet for everything." Trump on Wednesday celebrated the news that the U.S. GDP's growth rate had fallen from 2 percent to 1.9 percent. To Trump, that slight drop quantifies "the greatest economy in American history!" The Greatest Economy in American History! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2019 Compare that with how the economy performed back in 2012, when GDP growth similarly dropped to a revised 1.9 percent in the first quarter of the year. That was under former President Barack Obama, so Trump had another opinion on the matter.
