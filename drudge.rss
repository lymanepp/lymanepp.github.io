      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — As Americans commemorate Martin Luther King Jr., Democratic presidential hopefuls are fanning out across the country to honor the civil rights leader and make themselves heard on the national stage. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., used the holiday to launch a presidential campaign that, if successful, would make her the first woman and the second black candidate to become president. And an annual rally to observe King's birthday, held in the capital of South Carolina, a critical early-voting state in the Democratic primary, brought out two senators expected to seek the White House in 2020, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LOS ANGELES (AP) — For documentary filmmakers, there's no place like the Sundance Film Festival. The mountainside festival which kicks off Thursday in Park City, Utah, has become known for launching nonfiction films to box office successes and awards, and this year is shaping up to be no different. The slate boasts a wide array of films about fallen titans, from Harvey Weinstein to Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes, music legends Miles Davis and David Crosby, two of Michael Jackson's sexual abuse accusers, the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook scandal, Apollo 11, Mike Wallace, Toni Morrison and Dr. Ruth.</description>

So much has changed. This hasn't: Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. The duo, every bit as formidable now as when they won that first title, face the Rams, now back in Los Angeles, in a Super Bowl rematch of sorts that pits the NFL's past against its future. At 32, Sean McVay is the youngest Super Bowl coach. At 66, Bill Belichick has an NFL-record 30 playoff wins.</description>

The disturbance early Monday started hours after a group of men dressed in military fatigues and carrying assault weapons published a series of videos on social media saying they won't recognize President Nicolas Maduro's government. In one of the videos, a man identifying himself as 3rd Sgt. Figueroa, addressing the "people of Venezuela," urges his compatriots to take to the streets to show support for their rebellion.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Silicon Valley's notorious nemesis, Margrethe Vestager, plans to end her term as the European Union's antitrust enforcer this year with a bang, laying out a long-term plan to intensify scrutiny of the world's big tech companies. As the EU's competition commissioner, Vestager is arguably the world's most important tech regulator. Since 2014, she has slapped Google with eye-popping multibillion-dollar antitrust penalties, ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook over its WhatsApp acquisition — flagship enforcement cases that have struck fear into Silicon Valley while drawing attention in Washington.</description>

The statement was issued hours after Israeli missile defenses intercepted an incoming missile over the Golan Heights in the wake of the airport raid. "We have started striking Iranian Quds targets in Syrian territory," the military statement said.
