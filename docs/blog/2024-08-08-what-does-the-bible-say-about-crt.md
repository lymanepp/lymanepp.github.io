## The Influence of Marxist Ideology on Christian Leadership

In recent years, a troubling trend has emerged where prominent Christian leaders such as the late Tim Keller, Russell Moore, J.D. Greear, and Andy Stanley have aligned themselves with ideologies that starkly contrast with biblical teachings. This alignment is particularly evident in their support for Critical Race Theory (CRT), which is deeply rooted in Marxist ideology and raises significant concerns for the Christian faith.

CRT fundamentally rejects the concept of objective truth, centering its analysis on racial and class struggle. Originating from Marxist thought, CRT categorizes individuals into oppressors and oppressed based on racial identity and societal power. It asserts that racism is embedded in societal structures, implicating all white individuals due to systemic advantages. According to CRT, only those in positions of power—primarily white individuals—can be considered racist, excluding other racial groups from being seen as capable of racism. The theory advocates for a radical overhaul of societal frameworks to address perceived injustices, grounded in the belief that societal institutions are designed to perpetuate racial inequality.

Marxist ideologies, including CRT, are fundamentally atheistic and reject the concept of God. They are based on "liberation theology," which distorts Christian doctrine by framing social and economic struggles as central to salvation rather than focusing on personal redemption through Christ. Marxism promotes a materialistic worldview centered on class struggle and systemic change, which is at odds with biblical teaching. Christianity teaches that sin originates in the human heart: *"The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?"* (Jeremiah 17:9). Redemption comes through personal transformation in Christ: *"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!"* (2 Corinthians 5:17). By emphasizing systemic issues and rejecting a divine framework, CRT undermines the biblical message that salvation is a personal and spiritual matter achieved through faith in Jesus Christ rather than secular means.

CRT uses rhetoric and strategies that exacerbate rather than alleviate social and racial divides. It frames social interactions and structures in terms of power and oppression, which can deepen existing tensions and create new conflicts: *"For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice"* (James 3:16). A 2021 survey by the National Association of Scholars found that 63% of respondents believed CRT had led to increased racial polarization in workplaces and educational institutions. Similarly, a report from the Manhattan Institute highlighted how CRT’s framework of systemic oppression and power dynamics has contributed to heightened mistrust and conflict among racial groups, with incidents of racial animosity rising in schools and workplaces that implemented CRT-based training programs.

Gallup polls further illustrate the impact of CRT on race relations. In 2002, 65% of Americans expressed positive views on racial relations. By 2021, this figure had dropped to just 38%, reflecting a notable deterioration in perceptions of race relations over the past two decades. This decline aligns with observations that the emphasis on systemic racism and identity politics promoted by CRT can deepen divisions rather than foster unity. These outcomes underscore a significant divergence from the Gospel’s call for reconciliation and unity, emphasizing the need for a biblically grounded approach to addressing racial issues that fosters genuine understanding and harmony rather than exacerbating divisions.

In contrast, the Christian Gospel promotes unity and reconciliation through the grace of Jesus Christ: *"Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace"* (Ephesians 4:3). The Gospel’s message is one of peace and healing, aimed at bridging divides rather than amplifying them: *"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God"* (Matthew 5:9). Endorsing ideologies that emphasize division and conflict undermines the Gospel’s call for reconciliation and impedes the Church’s mission to bring people together in Christ: *"All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation"* (2 Corinthians 5:18).

The alignment with CRT risks shifting the Church’s focus away from its core mission. The Church is tasked with proclaiming the Gospel and making disciples: *"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age"* (Matthew 28:19-20). By endorsing these ideologies, the Church’s message may become entangled with political agendas, potentially diluting its primary mission.

The Gospel’s message of salvation and transformation through Christ must remain central to Christian teaching and practice: *"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile"* (Romans 1:16). Aligning with secular ideologies can divert attention from this mission and lead to confusion about the Church’s role in addressing societal issues.

The biblical approach to addressing issues like race and justice should focus on the process of sanctification, guiding believers to live lives that reflect Christ’s love and righteousness. Sanctification emphasizes the transformation of individual hearts and minds, leading to genuine change in communities and society at large. It calls for believers to reject sinful attitudes and behaviors, including racism, while seeking to embody the virtues of Christ: *"Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry"* (Colossians 3:5). By prioritizing sanctification and the transformative power of the Gospel, the Church can address social issues from a biblical perspective, promoting true justice and reconciliation that flows from a heart transformed by Christ: *"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will"* (Romans 12:2).

Additionally, CRT is causing significant divisions within churches by introducing a framework that emphasizes racial conflict and systemic injustice over the Gospel's message of unity and reconciliation. Churches that embrace CRT often find themselves entrenched in contentious debates over race, justice, and societal structures, leading to fragmentation among congregants: *"I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought"* (1 Corinthians 1:10). CRT’s focus on categorizing individuals as oppressors or oppressed based on racial identity can exacerbate existing tensions, fostering an environment where discussions about race become polarized and divisive: *"If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other"* (Galatians 5:15). This shift from spiritual unity and collective mission to social justice and systemic critique undermines the Church's role as a unifying body in Christ: *"then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind"* (Philippians 2:2). The resultant discord can erode relationships within congregations, hinder effective ministry, and divert attention from the core mission of spreading the Gospel and fostering Christian community.

Given these concerns, Christian leaders must critically evaluate their alignment with CRT. The Church’s role should be to address issues of justice and reconciliation through the transformative power of the Gospel, not through frameworks that conflict with its foundational truths: *"He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God"* (Micah 6:8). Christian leaders need to reaffirm their commitment to biblical teaching and approach issues of race and justice from a perspective that aligns with the core message of the Gospel. As we navigate these complex issues, it is crucial for leaders to seek wisdom and guidance to ensure their actions and teachings reflect the true message of Christ: *"If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you"* (James 1:5).
