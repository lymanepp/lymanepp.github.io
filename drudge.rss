      <title>'Cover up'... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Robert-Mueller-s-report-is-more-than-300-pages-13723654.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - House Democrats are ready to accuse Attorney General William Barr of a "coverup" to protect President Donald Trump if he refuses to detail for Congress the information special counsel Robert Mueller III provided the grand jury during his investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election.  The pointed warning, delivered by senior Democratic aides during a media briefing Thursday, marked the latest sign of a potential legal standoff between lawmakers and the Justice Department over access to Mueller's complete findings. Barr has pledged to redact grand jury information from Mueller's report, which spans more than 300 pages, according to people familiar with the document, and that process is expected to take weeks.  That is far longer than Democrats say they are prepared to wait, and they have begun to express suspicion that the attorney general intends to prevent the public disclosure of information within Mueller's findings that may be unflattering or otherwise problematic for the president. It remains unclear what precisely Barr plans to deliver to Congress.  "If he does not include grand jury information in the summary or report or redacted report or whatever he gives to Congress, that amounts to a coverup," a House Democratic staffer told reporters during Thursday's briefing. "We do not want anything in the words of the attorney general. We want to see Robert Mueller's words."  House Democrats also said Thursday that they are prepared to authorize a subpoena for Mueller's full report if Barr misses the Tuesday deadline lawmakers set for him to deliver it to Congress. They stopped short, however, of promising to issue a subpoena, even though the attorney general has indicated he is unlikely to make their deadline.  Democrats are bracing, too, for a potential fight with the administration if the...</description>
