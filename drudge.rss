      <title>Carl Reiner's key to living a long, funny life? Never stop having something to say...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/entertainment/article/Carl-Reiner-s-key-to-living-a-long-funny-life-15377662.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once funny, always funny? If you were Carl Reiner, yes.  Those great, beloved nonagenarians of show business (Reiner, his pals Mel Brooks and Norman Lear, Dick Van Dyke, Betty White, et al.) are all the proof we'll ever need that a sense of humor could well have something to do with longevity. It must. And it's not just the laughter. It's having a laugh with someone who knows you better than anyone else - the friends and loved ones, but also the audience, who has also known you forever.  In a 2017 HBO documentary appropriately titled "If You're Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast," Reiner (who died Monday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif., at 98) sat with Brooks and Lear and reminisced about the long weekend retreats they used to take together, with their spouses, a tradition they fondly called "Yenemvelt" (a variation on the Yiddish yenevelt), a word that refers to a kind of hereafter, a world yet to come - a far-off place where, as Reiner's mother taught him, all the good things would happen to you that weren't happening to you here and now.  The three friends believed they had never laughed harder, and felt closer, than during those days in their own Yenemvelt. (Lear even brought up Yenemvelt when I interviewed him a few years ago; framed photos from those weekends were in easy reach on the desk in his home office.)  In the documentary, Brooks wonders: Is laughter what's keeping us alive?  "While you're alive, you can laugh," Reiner replies. "When you're dead, the laughter is so difficult. So difficult."  Reiner never stopped coming up with a good line, something to say - funny or melancholy or trenchant. His last musings on his personal Twitter account appear to have been written just hours before he died. There is a final act of resistance - "As I arose at 7:30 this...</description>

      <title>Workers getting laid off for second time...</title>
      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/business/article/Workers-getting-laid-off-for-second-time-as-15377041.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she was first furloughed in March, Randee Heitzmann knew how to make ends meet.  She deferred payments on her new Honda Civic, spent $3,000 in stimulus money and tax returns on other payments, and drained her savings.  Then she was called back to her job, as a bartender at a cigar bar near Dallas for five weeks, taking home about $100 per shift, just 20% of what she was used to.  But on Friday, Heitzmann was cut loose again, hours before her shift was to begin.  "I don't have any savings left," the 28-year-old said. "I don't know how long it's going to be before I get a paycheck again."  Millions of American workers are suffering from economic whiplash, thinking they were finally returning to work only to be sent home again because of the coronavirus's latest surge. Stores, restaurants, gyms and other businesses that reopened weeks ago are shuttering again, and this time Congress appears less inclined to provide additional aid. Other businesses that had banked on customers returning and restrictions lifting - such as hotel chains, construction firms and movie theaters - are seeing hours cut and reopening dates pushed back indefinitely as consumer demand stalls.  And many governors, including some who had drawn scrutiny for initially playing down the virus's risks, are issuing new safety restrictions, in some cases just weeks after the first round of guidelines had begun to lift. In recent weeks, three states - California, Florida and Texas - have implemented policies that partly restrict restaurant or bar service. Nine others - Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico and North Carolina - have postponed or slowed reopening plans.  Thousands of workers are caught in these rapidly shifting seas, many of them hourly and low-wage...</description>

      <title>Can't wait to compare 'cognitive capability'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/922946/biden-says-cant-wait-compare-cognitive-capability-trumps</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Vice President Joe Biden is looking forward to showing off his brain. Biden fielded questions from reporters after a speech on Tuesday, one of whom told Biden that 'some have speculated that you are subject to some degree of cognitive decline.' The reporter asked, 'Have you been tested for some degree of cognitive decline?' The presumptive Democratic nominee for president responded that he's 'constantly tested.' 'Look, all you've got to do is watch me,' Biden asserted. 'And I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I'm running against.' Presumably, Biden has the 2020 presidential debates in mind as the venue to make this comparison, and he said he's committed to participating in three of them as scheduled. 'I'm looking forward to it,' he said. President Trump's campaign has accused Biden of, as one ad says, not having the 'mental fortitude required to lead this country.' During the Democratic primary, when asked what he would do if Trump went after him for his age and 'mental state' during a debate, Biden responded that he would challenge him to a push-up contest. 'I'd say, 'C'mon Donald, c'mon man,' Biden said. 'How many push-ups do you want to do here, pal?' I mean, jokingly. C'mon, run with me, man.' Brendan Morrow Biden responds to speculation that he's facing a cognitive decline: 'I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I am running against' https://t.co/Nj065CIsxp pic.twitter.com/SN2xWZ2LUR â€” CBS News (@CBSNews) June 30, 2020</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.cnn.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In hundreds of highly classified phone calls with foreign heads of state, President Donald Trump was so consistently unprepared for discussion of serious issues, so often outplayed in his conversations with powerful leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan, and so abusive to leaders of America's principal allies, that the calls helped convince some senior US officials -- including his former secretaries of state and defense, two national security advisers and his longest-serving chief of staff -- that the President himself posed a danger to the national security of the United States, according to White House and intelligence officials intimately familiar with the contents of the conversations.</description>

      <title>Americans living in big 'anger incubator'...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Americans-are-living-in-a-big-anger-incubator-15376110.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Americans are angry. The country erupted into the worst civil unrest in decades after the death of George Floyd, and anger about police violence and the country's legacy of racism is still running high. At the same time, we're dealing with anger provoked by the coronavirus pandemic: anger at public officials because they've shut down parts of society, or anger because they aren't doing enough to curb the virus. Anger about being required to wear a mask, or anger toward people who refuse to wear a mask. Anger with anyone who doesn't see things the "right" way.  "We're living, in effect, in a big anger incubator," said Raymond Novaco, a psychology professor at the University of California at Irvine, who has expertise in anger assessment and treatment.  According to psychiatrist Joshua Morganstein, the country is now dealing with "three disasters superimposed on top of one another": the pandemic, the economic fallout and civil unrest. "Certainly, one way of responding, and a common way of responding, is anger," said Morganstein, who chairs the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on the Psychiatric Dimensions of Disaster.  Surveys over the past few years suggested that anger had risen in the country even before the 2020 crises. A Gallup poll conducted in 2018, for example, concluded that Americans' stress, worry and anger had intensified that year. Twenty-two percent of Americans had felt anger the previous day, up from 17 percent the previous year.  The emergency weekly surveys conducted since April by the Census Bureau and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don't ask specifically about anger. But they reveal that many Americans are anxious or depressed - especially black and Asian Americans in the week following George Floyd's death. Both anxiety and depression can manifest as anger.  Anger is also an...</description>
