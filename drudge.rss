      <title>DRAMA: Witness reverses testimony, implicates EU ambassador...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/879521/kurt-volker-changes-past-testimony-admits-sondland-brought-biden-investigations-meeting-ukraine</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker has one big revision to his first impeachment testimony. In his original closed-door testimony, when asked if there was any talk of investigating the Bidens in a July 10 meeting with a Ukrainian defense leader, Volker repeatedly answered "no." But when appearing publicly before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, Volker reversed that statement. In his lengthy opening statement Tuesday, Volker mentioned meeting with then-National Security Adviser John Bolton, Ukraine's then-National Security and Defense, and other leaders. "I remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a generic comment about investigations," Sondland's new statement read, referring to U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and Trump's desired political investigations. "I think all of us thought it was inappropriate; the conversation did not continue," Volker added. Flash back to last month when Volker was asked if there was any talk of Rudy Giuliani's desired Biden probe in that meeting. Volker didn't even let the questioner finish before answering "no" three times in a row. Volker also made another change to his previous testimony, saying that while he didn't tell Ukraine there were conditions to receive U.S. aid, he "did not know" if others "were conveying a different message to them around that same time."

      <title>Piglets become latest animals to file cases in court...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Germany-s-male-piglets-become-the-latest-animals-14845685.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Germany's Federal constitutional Court received a highly unusual complaint on Tuesday, with the country's entire population of male piglets named as plaintiffs.  The piglets probably have no idea, but they could be about to write legal history, animal rights lawyers hope, even as critics decry the suit as a PR stunt.  Amid a wave of efforts worldwide to allow animals to become plaintiffs, the current case is Germany's first such constitutional challenge. It was filed by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) group - whose representatives also act as plaintiffs - and alleges that the German government is infringing upon the animals' rights.  It is still unclear if the court will allow the case to proceed.  PETA argues that the castration of male piglets is violating German law, which states that animals shall not be harmed without reasonable explanation. The castration of young piglets without anesthesia was long considered exempt - but that exemption was withdrawn in 2013.  Castration without anesthesia is still in use, however, as the German government delayed the law from taking effect, following a transition period that was initially expected to last four years.  PETA alleges that in delaying the changes, the government is violating German law. It also alleges that even with anesthesia, the castrations will remain illegal, as they will not be completely pain-free, said Christian Arleth, a lawyer with PETA.  Besides seeking an end to the castration practice, PETA aims to get animals recognized as legal entities.  The legal status of animals has gradually expanded in Germany over the last decades, from their de facto perception as objects to their current status as organisms with rights protected by the Constitution. In parallel, the United States has seen a...</description>
