      <title>Melania to give biggest speech in four years. Campaign hopes secret weapon... </title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/article/Melania-Trump-is-about-to-give-her-biggest-speech-15512286.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the eve of her big speech headlining the second night of the Republican National Convention, first lady Melania Trump appeared in front of the White House to talk up her husband's record on women.  "Since taking office," she said Monday at an event celebrating women's suffrage, "my husband and this administration have taken historic measures to empower and support women in the United States - and around the world."  It was a prelude to Tuesday's prime-time speech, her biggest since the 2016 Republican convention and a far more public and political spotlight than she normally seeks. With President Donald Trump's campaign strategists privately saying that suburban women are a weak spot for him, they hope she will help attract voters from that crucial bloc.  For the first lady, it also will be a chance for redemption. The last time she spoke at the Republican National Convention, she was accused of plagiarizing Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Convention speech. (A Trump Organization employee took the fall, though others have pointed fingers at poor staffing that meant no one had vetted Melania Trump's remarks.)  This time around, Trump - the only first lady who did not grow up speaking English - has spent days crafting the speech, according to a White House aide. She's leaning heavily on departing presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway, one of her top allies in the West Wing, and Stephanie Grisham, the former press secretary and her current chief of staff, as well as her top aide, Marcia Lee Kelly. Kelly, who is also CEO of this year's convention, has been closely working with Trump in Washington to prepare her speech in recent days, a person familiar with the matter said.  White House officials and members of the first lady's staff would not answer basic questions on the record, if at all, fully aware that she...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As wildfires continue to rage throughout California, residual plumes of smoke have drifted all the way to the Midwest, reaching as far as the Northwestern region of Kansas. The haze is expected to linger in the air for most of next week before the high pressure system moves toward the Mississippi Valley and potentially into some of the southeastern states, according to Matt Gerard, lead forecaster of the NWS in Dodge City.  "That's a lot of smoke to be traveling that far east," said Gerard. "Here, we've had some pretty bright red sunrises and sunsets, and the smoke up in the atmosphere coming overhead really gives the sky a grayish look."</description>

      <title>Postmaster admits he doesn't know what postage costs...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/933313/postmaster-general-admits-doesnt-know-what-costs-mail-postcard</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does it cost to mail a postcard? Don't ask the guy in charge of the United States Postal Service. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified before Congress on Monday to face questions from lawmakers about controversial changes at USPS. But when it was Rep. Katie Porter's (D-Calif.) turn for questions, she decided to open with a bit of a pop quiz about Postal Service prices. For one, she wanted to know, what does a first class postage stamp cost? Fifty-five cents, he answered. But how much does it cost to mail a postcard? With that question, DeJoy was stumped. 'I don't know,' he said. When a surprised Porter shot back, 'you don't know the cost to mail a postcard,' DeJoy laughed and confirmed, 'I don't.' As Porter continued to ask some pricing questions, DeJoy admitted, 'I know very little about postage stamps.' He also said he doesn't know the starting rate for USPS priority mail, and he couldn't estimate how many people voted by mail in the last presidential election. 'I'm glad you know the price of a stamp,' Porter said, 'but I'm concerned about your understanding of this agency.' But to be fair to DeJoy, The Atlantic's David A. Graham quipped, 'he isn't the postmaster specific.' Brendan Morrow 'You don't know the cost to mail a postcard?' After Postmaster General DeJoy fails to name cost of several types of postage, he says, â€œI'll submit that I know very little' about postage stamps. â€œIâ€™m concerned about your understanding of this agency,' Rep. Katie Porter says. pic.twitter.com/0y4wQGZNku â€” ABC News (@ABC) August 24, 2020</description>

      <title>Rio Grande Valley riven by death and anxiety...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Coronavirus-has-left-the-Rio-Grande-Valley-riven-15510066.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MCALLEN, Texas - The grotto of St. Jude Thaddeus is covered in handwritten petitions for protection against the coronavirus, pinned funeral cards, hospital bracelets and photos of the sick and dying.  Graveyard workers lower caskets into the earth three or four times a day instead of once or twice a week. Masked mourners surround fresh mounds of dirt by the hour. Curanderas perform cleansing rituals for the grief-stricken. A parish priest cannot remember how many times he has rung the funeral bell. Helicopters swoop in, as if in a war, to spirit away the critically ill.  A friend watched her neighbor plead silently for prayer on live video days before she stopped breathing. A son waited with clasped hands every evening in the hospital parking lot with half a dozen other faithful, sending supplications heavenward.  Teachers. Janitors. Bankers. Politicians. Neighbors. Colleagues. Children.  Few here in Texas's lower Rio Grande Valley have been left untouched by the pandemic's lethal reach, as the virus has ripped through the border region, infecting tens of thousands of people and killing more than 1,500 just in the months after Texas thought it had escaped the virus's grip and started to reopen, according to Washington Post data.  The region of more than 1.2 million people in four counties accounts for approximately 15 percent of all of the state's virus-related fatalities. Though the governor has surged resources here, the pandemic has plunged the Valley into a state of perpetual grief.  "We just can't take another emotional step," said Ivan Melendez, Hidalgo County's health authority and a practicing doctor in McAllen. "There's not been one day in the last three months that someone hasn't asked me: 'Did you hear who died?' "  The Rio Grande Valley is a place that thrives...</description>

      <title>Don Jr. and future of Trumpism: He upended expectations four years ago. What now?</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/Donald-Trump-Jr-and-the-future-of-Trumpism-He-15509929.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The eldest son of the future president strode onto the stage at the 2016 Republican National Convention in a gray suit with his hair slicked back, awash in low expectations.  Donald Trump Jr.'s previous public appearances had been dutiful and less than dazzling - cameos alongside his father on "The Apprentice," speeches for business audiences, a failed math quiz on Howard Stern's radio show. Just a few months before his father entered the presidential race, Don Jr. was dabbling as a guest host of infomercials where he would interview executives marketing temporary office rentals and obscure construction techniques.  "What exactly is grip metal technology?" the real estate scion, stiff and unsmiling, asked one guest.  To prepare for his convention speech four years ago, Don Jr. practiced each day for a week. When he took the lectern, he started by praising his wonderful wife and mentioning their five children - and then identified himself as the son of "a great man."  The speech was notable for its polish. The candidate himself would fulminate in his own speech about violence in the streets, but Don Jr. eloquently heralded his father's common touch. His father "didn't hide out behind some desk in an executive suite. . . . We didn't learn from MBAs. We learned from people who had doctorates in common sense," Don Jr. told a rapt crowd. He didn't call Mexicans rapists. He didn't hurl insults. As he went on, the speech developed its own cadence; soon, the packed convention hall was calling out "Trump!" after each of his rhythmic sentences.  The political world was dazzled. "Poised and focused," wrote the New York Post's John Podhoretz, calling it a speech Trump Sr. would never have been able to pull off. "I think I watched the speech of a future politician there," said David Chalian, CNN's political director. "In fact, a much...</description>

      <title>Orwell's nightmare? Facial recognition for animals promises farmyard revolution...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Orwell-s-nightmare-Facial-recognition-for-15509879.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;YECHANG, China - There are many challenges to applying facial recognition technology to animals: Pigs don't have distinguishing features and cows often want to lick the cameras. But there is an advantage: Farmyard inhabitants tend not to complain about impingements on their civil liberties.  Having mastered facial recognition for humans to an alarmingly precise degree, even picking out wanted criminals from huge crowds, Chinese tech whizzes are turning their attention to furrier faces.  "We've been using it for sheep, pigs and cows," said Zhao Jinshi, who studied at Cornell University and founded Beijing Unitrace Tech, a company developing software for the agriculture industry.  "For pigs, it's more difficult because pigs all look the same, but dairy cows are a bit special because they are black and white and have different shapes," Zhao said as he checked on the technology installed in a pilot project here at a farm in Hebei province, outside Beijing.  China has led the world in developing facial recognition capabilities. There are almost 630 million facial recognition cameras in use in the country, for security purposes as well as for everyday conveniences like entering train stations and paying for goods in stores.  But authorities also use the technology for sinister means, such as monitoring political dissidents and ethnic minorities.  One Chinese AI company, Megvii, which has been blacklisted by the Department of Commerce for alleged involvement in the Chinese government's repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang, is applying its technology to a program to recognize dogs by their nose prints. Other tech companies around the world have had a go at identifying chimpanzees, dolphins, horses and lions, with varying degrees of success.  Chinese entrepreneurs see an opportunity to...</description>
