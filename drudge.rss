      <title>How exercise keeps CBS anchor Norah O'Donnell sane... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/entertainment/article/Exercise-keeps-CBS-Evening-News-anchor-Norah-14498119.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Television correspondents and news anchors have stressful, demanding jobs, especially in today's never-ending news cycle. We asked Norah O'Donnell, anchor and managing editor of "CBS Evening News," how she takes care of herself. After many years as a TV correspondent and a recent stint as co-anchor of "CBS This Morning," O'Donnell, 45, became the third solo female anchor of a network evening newscast when she took over this summer. She will also anchor the network's election specials and continue to contribute to "60 Minutes." She lives in New York, but she and the evening show will relocate to Washington later in the fall. The interview has been edited and condensed.  - - -  Q: What do wellness and self-care mean to you?  A: I really appreciate that you used the word self-care because I do think that health, exercise and wellness should be put in the category of self-care. Several years ago, I was sitting next to a friend of my husband's at an event, and he said: "How are you doing?" And I said, "Well, I'm doing fine. I'm doing this at work, and work is really busy, and you know the kids are really busy." And he said, "OK, but I'm asking about you and how you are doing." It really became this lightbulb moment that probably a lot of people can relate to: Our lives are defined by our work, and they're defined by our families, but we also need to be selfish when it comes to self-care.  I try to approach a lot of this stuff, whether it's what I eat or when I exercise, by asking: What am I doing to my body so that I can do the job that I do every day? I'm putting fuel in my body so that I can do all of the things that I really want to do and not worry about it. I approach nutrition that way, too. For breakfast I try to eat eggs, or blueberries with yogurt. Lunch can be hard when I'm running around, but I like to eat a...</description>

      <title>Average commute time hits record...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Average-commute-time-reached-a-new-record-last-14497488.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The average American commute grew to just over 27 minutes one way in 2018, a record high, according to data released in September by the U.S. Census Bureau.  The average American has added about two minutes to their one-way commute since 2009, the data shows. That may not sound like a lot, but those numbers add up: The typical commuter now spends 20 more minutes a week commuting than they did a decade ago. Over the course of a year, it works out to about 17 additional hours commuting.  Relative to 1980, the picture is even more grim: Since then, American workers have lost nearly an hour a week to their commutes, the equivalent of one full-time workweek over the course of a year. All told, the average American worker spent 225 hours, or well over nine full calendar days, commuting in 2018.  The shift is being driven in large part by an increase in the share of workers with long commutes. In 2010, about 8 percent of workers had a one-way commute of 60 minutes or more. By 2018, that share had edged up to nearly 10 percent. As of 2018, there were 4.3 million workers with commutes of 90 minutes or more, up from 3.3 million in 2010.  Rising commute times reflect the challenges of life in many metropolitan areas where new housing isn't being built fast enough. As a result, many workers are forced out to far-flung suburbs and exurban areas in search of affordable homes.  Transit and infrastructure woes are another factor. Many metropolitan areas put off necessary spending on roads, bridges and public transit as their populations soared, creating congestion as people try to get to and from work. In Washington, D.C., daily Metro ridership has fallen by 17 percent since 2008 while the population of the greater metro region has grown by several hundred thousand, resulting in one of the worst commutes in the nation.  Research has...</description>
