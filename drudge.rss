      <title>American deaths top 1,000, amid incomplete reporting... </title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/U-S-deaths-from-coronavirus-top-1-000-amid-15158939.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It began as a mysterious disease with frightening potential. Now, just two months after America's first confirmed case, the country is grappling with a lethal reality: The coronavirus has killed more than 1,000 people in the United States, a toll that is increasing at an alarming rate.  As the highly contagious virus has created clusters of illness, from Seattle to New York City, death has followed in turn. On Wednesday night, the country's largest city reported 88 new deaths from covid-19. Americans have died in 42 states and territories and the District, with punishing increases in Louisiana and Michigan. Experts fear the worst is still to come, pointing to a rapid acceleration of cases in communities across the country.  The Washington Post is tracking every known U.S. death, analyzing data from health agencies and gathering details from family and friends of the victims. In the first 1,000 fatalities, some patterns have begun to emerge in the outbreak's epidemiology and its painful human impact. About 65% of people whose ages are known were older than 70 and nearly 40% were over 80, a risk that rises along with age. About 5% whose ages are known were in their 40s or younger, but many more in that age group have been sick enough to be hospitalized. Nearly 60% of the dead were men.  What remains murky is exactly who is dying in America during the pandemic, even as scientists and public health experts race to uncover information that can help save lives.  Overwhelmed state and local authorities have been issuing widely varying reports on those who died, citing medical privacy laws to shield even basic details about age, gender and underlying conditions, the three signal categories that epidemiologists say are key indicators of risk.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which offers a well-regarded and...</description>

But growing segments of the U.S. population say state and federal governments are trampling on freedoms central to American life in the name of protecting public health.</description>

      <title>Escaping coronavirus anxiety in the Texas desert...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Escaping-coronavirus-anxiety-in-the-Texas-desert-15158219.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MARATHON, Texas - There were no lines, but the shelves were just as empty as any store across the country, unless you were in the market for a snake or two.  Along Highway 90 near Big Bend National Park, in one of the most desolate parts of West Texas, Target Marathon, as it is known locally, was open for business, though not the kind one might expect.  About four years ago, an unidentified artist transformed an old cinder block railroad building into a tiny fake Target store, complete with the retail chain's familiar red bull's eye logo. Some interpreted it as the equalizing cousin to Prada Marfa, an art installation located in an equally remote roadside spot about an hour down the road.  But unlike Prada Marfa, a faux retail store that showcases a display of Prada purses and shoes behind a reinforced glass storefront, Target Marathon has no stock - just a red shopping cart parked out front, a prop for those who venture deep into the Chihuahuan Desert to find it.  In recent days, the tiny Target has taken on a new kind of visitor - people who have come to what some around here describe as the end of the earth to practice a kind of extreme social distancing to avoid catching the novel coronavirus and find some respite from the unsettling headlines, even if it is only between pockets of working cellular coverage.  On a recent afternoon, Sarah McGraw, a 41-year-old photographer from Greenville, South Carolina, pulled up in a large white van that she had purchased about a year ago to travel across the country, hiking and backpacking in national parks. But the purchase has taken on a new usefulness in recent weeks.  McGraw, who specializes in pet portraiture for personal and commercial clients, had been in Phoenix for an assignment when the coronavirus pandemic began shutting down much of the country. She retreated into her...</description>

      <title>Brazil's Bolsonaro:  It's just 'a little cold'...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Brazil-s-Bolsonaro-channeling-Trump-dismisses-15157384.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO - He said self-isolation was "mass confinement." He called the novel coronavirus a "little cold." He asked, if only people older than 60 are at risk, "why close the schools?"  This was Jair Bolsonaro, leader of Latin America's largest country, calling on Brazilians to return to jobs, public spaces and commerce amid the coronavirus pandemic, contradicting not only his own health officials, but also the global consensus on how to see countries through the pandemic without a crippling loss of life.  It was a portrait of Bolsonaro isolated and unbound: Alone before the camera, attacking the media, undermining political opponents, indulging talking points he's used since the crisis began even as the disturbing reality overtook his sanguine predictions.  "Most of the media has been countervailing," he declared in a national address Tuesday. "They spread the sensation of dread, with their flagship the high number of victims in Italy. The perfect scenario to be used by the media to spread hysteria."  "In my particular case," the 65-year-old former army officer added, "with my history as an athlete, if I were infected by the virus, I wouldn't need to worry. I wouldn't feel anything or, if very affected, it would be like a little flu or little cold."  Rather than calming panic and confusion, Bolsonaro's pronouncements appear to be only fueling them. As confirmed cases and deaths mount - Brazil leads Latin America in both - fear is growing over whether the country's institutions and leaders will rise to the challenge of a historic moment, with far less room for error than wealthier countries already in the full grip of coronavirus.  The minister of health has warned the health system will collapse by the end of April. Millions of already impoverished people face weeks without income. Hunger could sweep the country....</description>

      <title>Politicians jockeying for covid-19 tests find proximity to Trump is fastest route...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Politicians-jockeying-for-covid-19-tests-find-15157424.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Late last month, Mick Mulvaney, who was still the acting White House chief of staff at the time, told a crowd of conservative activists that the media was exaggerating the threat posed by covid-19 because "they think this will bring down the president, that's what this is all about. . . . It's not a death sentence, it's not the same as the Ebola crisis."  But unbeknown to attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mulvaney had already received a coronavirus test, at the recommendation of the White House physician. The test, which has not been reported until now, was followed by a second this month after a niece with whom Mulvaney shares an apartment was around members of a Brazilian delegation who later tested positive for the virus.  Mulvaney is one of three President Donald Trump confidants to get a coronavirustest while exhibiting no symptoms of the disease. And on Sunday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., announced he tested positive despite being asymptomatic, refusing to disclose how he was able to get tested in Washington on March 16.  The easy access Paul and other high-ranking politicians have gotten to coronavirus tests highlights the extent to which members of America's elite continue to have greater access to medical care during the pandemic, even as federal officials emphasize that testing should be reserved for health care providers and people who are seriously ill. Even in the nation's capital, hospitals are reporting a shortage of tests and the protective gear needed to administer them.  "It's a horrible flouting of our public health recommendations," Robyn Gershon, a clinical professor of epidemiology at the New York University School of Global Public Health, said in a phone interview.  In the cases of Mulvaney, Trump's incoming chief of staff Mark Meadows and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., White House...</description>
