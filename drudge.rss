      <title>The political theater of McEnany's scripted walk-offs...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/The-political-theater-of-Kayleigh-McEnany-s-15384519.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kayleigh McEnany's press briefings don't just draw to a close. They tend to end with a flourish - a true walk-off moment.  It happened again at the White House on Monday. President Donald Trump's press secretary was speaking to reporters when one asked about his denial of reports that Russian operatives offered bounties to Taliban members who kill American troops in Afghanistan. But, a reporter noted, Trump had also claimed that he had never been briefed on the subject - so how could he be certain there were never any bounties?  McEnany was ready for this one.  Quickly flipping pages in her briefing binder, McEnany launched into an extended critique of the New York Times, which broke the Russia story last week. Reading from her notes, she rattled off a series of alleged errors published by the Times in its reporting about Russia over the past four years, including a claim that 17 intelligence agencies had agreed about Russian interference in the 2016 election. (Only four agencies had done so.)  Then she unleashed the uppercut punch: "It is inexcusable, the failed Russia reporting of the New York Times. And I think it's time that the New York Times, and also The Washington Post, hand back their Pulitzers."  Bam!  And with that, McEnany snapped her binder shut and strode out of the briefing room, trailed by the unanswered shouts and murmurs of the White House press corps.  Such dramatic exits have become a signature of McEnany's brief tenure as press secretary. Since taking the job in April, the former Trump-friendly CNN pundit and spokeswoman for Trump's reelection campaign has often waited until the briefing's conclusion - that is, the moment when she determines the briefing is concluded - to unload on the assembled reporters.

'The heightened risk of agents getting sick' while preparing for rallies in states like Arizona and Oklahoma 'has begun to frazzle agents and their families,' the Post reports, citing people close to agents. Their worries aren't unfounded: The Post says Pence was forced to duck out of a 'Faith in America' campaign rally scheduled for Tuesday in Arizona after some of his Secret Service agents displayed coronavirus symptoms and at least one tested positive.

This is the second time recently that Secret Service agents have contracted the virus while prepping for an event for the administration. Two agents tested positive before Trump's controversial rally in Tulsa on June 20, and at least eight campaign staff members who helped plan the event have also tested positive. Catherine Milhoan, the director of communications for the Secret Service, told The New York Times that 'the health and safety of our work force, their families, and that of our protectees remains the agency's highest priority.'
