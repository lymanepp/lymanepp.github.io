      <title>Roy Cohn, architect of Trump strategy on impeachment...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Roy-Cohn-the-architect-of-Trump-s-strategy-on-14534364.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's road to fame has been propelled by willfully distorting reality to cloak the truth. "The Apprentice," for example, was perhaps TV's greatest "extreme makeover" of all time, portraying Trump as a fabulously wealthy businessman even as he was declaring fifth and sixth bankruptcies.  Given this history, Trump's repeated lies in the White House and his approach to combating the impeachment investigation undertaken by the House shouldn't surprise us. Trump is executive producing his own defense, including a letter produced by the White House counsel declaring the impeachment inquiry illegitimate - even though that is quite evidently not true - and refusing to cooperate.  While deception is a longtime Trump tactic, so too is it a longtime Republican tactic, one that dates to the beginning of the Cold War. And there is a tie between Trump's usage of the practice, and Republicans' usage: Trump's mentor, Roy Cohn.  In 1945, Republicans were desperate to stop the dynastic Democratic dominance of President Franklin Roosevelt. This led the GOP to inflame and exploit the nascent U.S. conflict with the Soviets to damage liberalism, and by extension, the Democratic Party.
