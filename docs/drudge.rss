      <description>realclearpolitics.com ⮞ Vice President Kamala Harris said Republicans are "trying to weaponize the use of the law" against women in remarks Tuesday night at a gala for EMILY's List, a pro-choice political action committee.  "Never be in doubt why EMILY's List is important," Harris said. "Last night makes the point. Women's rights in America are under attack. Roe v. Wade, in its power, has protected a woman's right, her right to make decisions about her own body for nearly half a century. If the court overturns Roe v. Wade, it will be a direct assault on freedom, on the fundamental right to self-determination to which all Americans are entitled." "Roe protects the right to access abortion," the vice president said. "It also protects a woman's right to make decisions about what she does with her own body. So to the friends, I say, we've always been clear, but today we know our purpose. We know, also, what we are up against. We have been on the frontlines of this fight for many years, all of us in this together. And now, we enter a new phase. There is nothing hypothetical about this moment. Let me be clear, this fight requires the work of this very organization, EMILY's List, to elect pro-choice Democrats to Congress." "Women in almost half the country could see their access to abortion severely limited," Harris said. "In 13 of those states, women could lose access to abortion immediately and outright. Those Republican leaders who are trying to weaponize the use of the law against women... how dare they! How dare they tell a woman what she can do and what she can't do with her own body! How dare they! How dare they try to stop her from determining her own future! How dare they try to deny women their rights and their freedoms!"</description>
