      <title>Fast, low, hard to stop: NKorea missile tests crank up threat level...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/North-Korea-s-missile-tests-crank-up-the-threat-14305847.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TOKYO - President Donald Trump has brushed off North Korea's resumption of missile launches, but the volley of tests in the past four months has significantly raised the country's military capabilities and the threat they pose to South Korea and U.S. forces on the peninsula, experts say.  The launches have included at least two new types of short-range ballistic missiles and a mobile multiple-rocket launcher. Pyongyang has also seen fit to show off a submarine that may be intended to carry nuclear warheads.  Trump says he's been told that Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader, "only smiles when he sees me." But photos released by North Korean state media show the dictator beaming from cheek to cheek at the successful tests.  "There's no question that the 2019 testing campaign that began in April has showcased some quite serious qualitative advancement in North Korean missile capabilities," said Ankit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow in the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists. "The core theme across all of the new weapons seems to be survivability, responsiveness, and missile-defense defeat."  The weapons that North Korea has showcased, including a road-mobile short-range ballistic missile known as the KN-23, with a range of at least 280 miles, appear specifically designed to confound South Korea's missile-defense system.  "The three missiles have several things in common: they are solid fuel, they are mobile, they are fast, they fly low, and at least the KN-23 can maneuver in-flight, which is very impressive," said Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at MIT.  "Any one of the missiles would pose a challenge to regional and [South Korean] missile defenses given these characteristics. Together, they pose a nightmare."  On...</description>

      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Netanyahu-appears-poised-to-block-Omar-Tlaib-14305839.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;JERUSALEM - A forthcoming trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories by Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., will possibly be blocked by Israel in its current proposed format, a senior Israeli government official told The Washington Post on Thursday.  Speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, the official said that if Tlaib, an American of Palestinian heritage, made a special humanitarian request to visit her family in the occupied West Bank, then "it would be considered favorably."  Omar and Tlaib, who have both been outspoken critics of Israel and support a boycott movement against the country, are slated to arrive Sunday. Their trip is being planned by Miftah, a nonprofit organization headed by Palestinian lawmaker and longtime peace negotiator Hanan Ashrawi.  Denying entry for Omar and Tlaib would likely deepen the divide between the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Democrats, who have privately said such moves are not emblematic of a country that prides itself as a democracy tolerant of political expression.  Informed Wednesday that Israel would formally deny entry for Omar and Tlaib, Democrats in Congress quietly braced for a new public fight with the long-serving Israeli leader, said several congressional aides familiar with the discussions.  It is still unclear whether Netanyahu will follow through on that decision, however, after a private backlash from the Democratic leadership and some U.S.-based pro-Israel groups, who warned against barring sitting members of Congress from entering Israel because of their political beliefs, said the aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.  With three weeks to go before a repeat election on Sept.17,Netanyahu is...</description>

      <title>Autopsy finds broken bones in Epstein's neck...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Autopsy-finds-broken-bones-in-Epstein-s-neck-14305473.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;An autopsy found that financier Jeffrey Epstein sustained multiple breaks in his neck bones, according to two people familiar with the findings, deepening the mystery about the circumstances around his death.  Among the bones broken in Epstein's neck was the hyoid bone, which in men is near the Adam's apple. Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, particularly if they are older, according to forensics experts and studies on the subject. But they are more common in victims of homicide by strangulation, the experts said.  The details are the first findings to emerge from the autopsy of Epstein, a convicted sex offender and multimillionaire in federal custody on charges of sex trafficking. He died early Saturday morning after guards found him hanging in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and he could not be revived.  Attorney General William Barr, whose department oversees the Bureau of Prisons facility where Epstein died, has described his death as an "apparent suicide." Justice officials declined to comment on the new information from Epstein's autopsy.  The office of New York City's chief medical examiner, Barbara Sampson, completed an autopsy of Epstein's body Sunday. But Sampson listed the cause of his death as pending.  Sampson's office did not comment on the injuries found in the autopsy.  The details add to the bizarre circumstances surrounding Epstein's death, which have launched a wave of questions and conspiracy theories about how he could have died in federal custody. Even President Donald Trump has egged on speculation, without evidence, that Epstein - whose alleged victims say they were pushed to have sex with his powerful and celebrity friends - might have been killed to keep him from spilling the secrets of others.

      <title>Maine families facing elder boom and worker shortage in preview of nation's future...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/A-catastrophic-trend-in-Maine-A-shortage-of-14305176.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DOVER-FOXCROFT, Maine - Janet Flaherty got an alarming call last October from the agency tasked with coordinating in-home care for her 82-year-old mother. It could no longer send her mom's home caretaker. It knew of no other aides who could care for her mother, either.  Flaherty's mother, Caroline, has for two years qualified for in-home care paid for by the state's Medicaid program. But the agency could not find someone to hire amid a severe shortage of workers that has crippled facilities for seniors across the state.  With private help now bid up to $50 an hour, Janet and her two sisters have been forced to do what millions of families in a rapidly aging America have done: take up second, unpaid jobs caring full time for their mother.  "We do not know what to do. We do not know where to go. We are in such dire need of help," said Flaherty, an insurance saleswoman.  Across Maine, families like the Flahertys are being hammered by two slow-moving demographic forces - the growth of the retirement population and a simultaneous decline in young workers - that have been exacerbated by a national worker shortage pushing up the cost of labor. The unemployment rate in Maine is 3.2 percent, below the national average of 3.7 percent.  The disconnect between Maine's aging population and its need for young workers to care for that population is expected to be mirrored in states throughout the country over the coming decade, demographic experts say. And that's especially true in states with populations with fewer immigrants, who are disproportionately represented in many occupations serving the elderly, statistics show.  "We have added an entire generation since we first put the safety net in place but with no plan whatsoever for how to support them," said Ai-jen Poo, co-director of Caring Across Generations, which advocates for...</description>

      <title>President lashes out at fed for 'CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE!'</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/859058/exacerbating-recession-fears-trump-diverts-blame-fed-crazy-inverted-yield-curve</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The president has weighed in on the possibly, but maybe not actually ominous inverted yield curve. President Trump isn't a fan of the "crazy" inversion, but unlike many of his critics who have placed America's trade war with China front and center when it comes to reasons why a global recession might be looming, he's pointing to a different problem â€” and it's not one of the items on Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman's smorgasbord of economic issues, either. No, Trump's mad at the Federal Reserve, like he has been for a while. The president frequently clamored for the Fed to slash interest rates, and even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell did eventually cut rates in July, Trump has deemed the action far too little, too late. ..Spread is way too much as other countries say THANK YOU to clueless Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. Germany, and many others, are playing the game! CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE! We should easily be reaping big Rewards &amp; Gains, but the Fed is holding us back. We will Win! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2019 Many economists don't agree with Trump. Krugman, for instance, doesn't place sole responsibility for the global economy's teetering on the trade war, but he does consider it a factor. Meanwhile, The Washington Post also reports that the trade war, often through indirect effects like a decline in business confidence and investment, has played a major role in the slowdown. Considering markets closed with their biggest point declines of the year soon after his tweet, it's clear Trump didn't do much to mollify spooked investors. Tim O'Donnell</description>
