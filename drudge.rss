      <title>GEORGE CONWAY: Trump is cancer on presidency. Congress should remove...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/George-Conway-Trump-is-a-cancer-on-the-13779435.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it turns out that, indeed, President Donald Trump was not exonerated at all, and certainly not "totally" or "completely," as he claimed. Special counsel Robert Mueller didn't reach a conclusion about whether Trump committed crimes of obstruction of justice - in part because, while a sitting president, Trump can't be prosecuted under long-standing Justice Department directives, and in part because of "difficult issues" raised by "the President's actions and intent." Those difficult issues involve, among other things, the potentially tricky interplay between the criminal obstruction laws and the president's constitutional authority, and the difficulty in proving criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt.  Still, the special counsel's report is damning. Mueller couldn't say, with any "confidence," that the president of the United States is not a criminal. He said, stunningly, that "if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state." Mueller did not so state.  That's especially damning because the ultimate issue shouldn't be - and isn't - whether the president committed a criminal act. As I wrote not long ago, Americans should expect far more than merely that their president not be provably a criminal. In fact, the Constitution demands it.  The Constitution commands the president to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." It requires him to affirm that he will "faithfully execute the Office of President" and to promise to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution." And as a result, by taking the presidential oath of office, a president assumes the duty not simply to obey the laws, civil and criminal, that all citizens must obey, but alsoto be subjected to higher duties - what some excellent recent legal...</description>

      <title>Billionaires pledged money to rebuild. Then came backlash...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Billionaires-raced-to-pledge-money-to-rebuild-13777806.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARIS - The eventual reconstruction of Notre Dame is now a foregone conclusion. Within hours of the fire that destroyed much of the cathedral on Monday, donors pledged more than $1 billionto restore the Parisian icon to its former glory.  Even before the smoke had cleared, Luxury goods magnate Francois-Henri Pinault announced his family would donate 100 million euros ($112 million) to the effort. Not to remain on the sideline, his rival Bernard Arnault - the chief executive of LVMH and the richest man in Europe - pledged twice that amount on Tuesday morning. The Bettencourt Meyers family, which controls L'Oreal, quickly matched that pledge. And Patrick Pouyanne, chief of excutive of French oil giant Total, offered another $112 million.  Officials are still assessing the extent of the damage, so the cost of Notre Dame's reconstruction remains unknown, but these and the many other donations coming in should pretty well cover it.  In the meantime, the cascade of cash that materialized overnight to save the cathedral has raised eyebrows in France, still in the throes of a crippling protest over rising social inequality and whose leader is regularly decried as the "president of the rich."  "Of course, I find it nice, this solidarity," said Ingrid Levavasseur, a leader of the yellow vest movement that has protested inequality in a series of often violent Saturday demonstrations since mid-November. The stream of donations essentially confirmed the movement's broader social critique, Levavasseur said.  "If they can give tens of millions to rebuild Notre-Dame, then they should stop telling us there is no money to help with the social emergency," Philippe Martinez, head of the CGT trade union, said on Wednesday.  The cash flow has also furrowed brows abroad, with critics emphasizing...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conservative columnist Ann Coulter said she could support Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for president if he returned to this old stance on immigration. In an interview with PBS 'Firing Line' host Margaret Hoover, Coulter said she doesn't care about "the rest of the socialist stuff" if Sanders went back to his original "pro-blue-collar position." MARGARET HOOVER, 'FIRING LINE' HOST: What do you think about Bernie Sanders? If Bernie Sanders is for getting rid of low-skilled workers to ensure higher wages for [Americans]. ANN COULTER: And protecting the border. If he went back to his original position, which is the pro-blue-collar position, I mean, it totally makes sense with him. If he went back to that position, I'd vote for him. I might work for him. I don't care about the rest of the socialist stuff, just can we do something for ordinary Americans?</description>
