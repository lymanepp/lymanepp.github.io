      <title>CDC creating wastewater surveillance system...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/937817/cdc-working-create-covid19-wastewater-surveillance-system-sewage-samples-prove-effective</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Testing wastewater for a deadly virus isn't new — it has been used to identify polio outbreaks — but the idea has gained traction as cities and universities look for ways to plod toward normalcy as the world awaits a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Universities have had great success monitoring for COVID-19 flare-ups by testing wastewater, or 'all the dirty stuff from the toilets, showers, sinks, washing machines, dishwashers, you name it,' Politico reports. And now 'the CDC and HHS are working on a national wastewater surveillance system and data portal' for willing states and local governments. People shed the coronavirus in their waste days before they show signs of illness, so finding COVID-19 in wastewater can give authorities 'seven precious days for intervention,' said Ian Pepper at the University of Arizona. His team tested the wastewater outside dorms every morning, but monitoring samples of sewage in Baton Rouge predicted an outbreak two weeks after Louisiana's governor lifted restrictions — then tracked the sharp decline in infections after the governor started requiring people to wear masks. Setting up a nationwide wastewater surveillance system early in the pandemic would have helped alert officials before an outbreak took hold, says David Larsen, an epidemiologist and public health expert at Syracuse University, one of the schools that tests wastewater. 'My kids would be in school right now. Our economy would not have tanked the way that it has.' And testing every U.S. ZIP code twice a week would cost about $3 billion a year, Larsen estimates. 'It's really not much. The cost per person monitored is like $10, if that, a year.' The payoff, he said, is it 'would be huge to get us back to work' for the year before a vaccine becomes widely available. Peter Weber</description>

With the epidemic expected to hit the city with far greater force in coming weeks, Professor Kevin Fenton, London director of Public Health England, made clear that more restrictions may be imposed, including some possibly across the capital, to avoid a more stringent lockdown.</description>

      <title>In Denmark, forest the new classroom...</title>
      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/In-Denmark-the-forest-is-the-new-classroom-15570973.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAMSO, Denmark - On a balmy Monday afternoon earlier this month, Sebastian Lukas, 27, watched from across a clearing as his third- and fourth-grade students whittled branches into spearheads with sharp knives.  His gaze turned to another group, who were supposed to be working on math problems. Two students, perched on a log, scrambled to produce their textbooks, just in time to look busy.  Lukas began the year teaching in a classroom like any other, in Samso Frie Skole, a school on the Danish island of Samso. But when the novel coronavirus pandemic struck, the school, like many across the country, embraced a new way to hold certain classes: almost entirely outdoors.  Instead of sitting at desks, Lukas's students wander through a rambling woodland, lush with trees and crisscrossed by dirt tracks.  As countries grapple with how and when to restore students to classrooms, a growing number of schools have embraced outdoor learning - especially in the highly regarded Nordic education systems, where the model had already begun to gain momentum.  When many Danish schools reopened in April, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged teachers to allow for as much time outdoors as possible, as a precaution against the spread of the virus. In Norway, education and health officials also recommended that classes meet outside.  Out of nearly 200 Norwegian schools willing to respond to a recent survey by researchers Ulrich Dettweiler and Gabriele Lauterbach, the results of which have not yet been published, more than half said they had begun to provide more outdoor classes. Researchers in Denmark said they had observed a similar trend.  Some countries, including Germany, have a tradition of outdoor preschools and kindergartens, which have begun to catch on in the United States as well. The...</description>

      <title>The Senate seats most likely to flip...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/The-Senate-seats-most-likely-to-flip-in-November-15570881.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Republicans have a slim, three-seat majority in the Senate that they're trying to hold on to in November. And they are in for a battle to do it: There are 13 chances on this list for Democrats to flip Senate seats and just two for Republicans.  But Republican strategists say they're seeing evidence that Republican-leaning voters turned off by President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus are starting to come home to the party in the final stretch, and they think it might be enough for some of these vulnerable Republican senators to hang on and deny Democrats the majority.  Democrats' path to the majority is to net at least four Senate seats or net three and win the White House to get the majority, but that requires going through some Republican-leaning states.  For now, the most competitive races remain largely unchanged from our last rankings in August. We'll update these rankings again between now and November.  Because so many of the races could go either way - while others are more of a stretch - we divided them in three categories: More likely to flip than not, toss-ups, and could flip under the right conditions.  - More likely to flip than not: Alabama, Colorado and Arizona.  1. Alabama (Democrat-held): Democratic Sen. Doug Jones remains the most vulnerable senator in 2020. He's facing former Auburn University coach Tommy Tuberville, a first-time candidate that Democrats are modestly optimistic could stumble in the spotlight. But no one with a stake is arguing that a Senate race in one of the most pro-Trump states in the country is a toss-up.  2. Colorado (Republican-held): Republican Sen. Cory Gardner is trying to pull away from Trump in this purple-blue state by talking about an outdoors conservation bill he wrote, rather than how he voted to...</description>

      <title>China's third aircraft carrier takes shape, with ambitions to challenge U.S. dominance...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/China-s-third-aircraft-carrier-takes-shape-with-15570885.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TAIPEI, Taiwan - Shipbuilders in Shanghai have laid out the hull of China's first modern aircraft carrier, which could be launched into the water in the coming months as it enters the latter phases of construction, according to new satellite images and state media reports.  High-resolution photos recently obtained by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a non-partisan think tank in Washington, show for the first time sections of the carrier being assembled in the open at a dry dock at the sprawling Jiangnan shipyard. The vessel, which will be China's third carrier but the first to be equipped with modern technology, is likely to be larger than the previous two that were based on outdated Soviet designs. At the waterline, the new ship will be about 1,000 feet long and 130 feet wide, the photos show.  Matthew Funaiole, a researcher at the CSIS ChinaPower project, said it is not yet clear from the images whether the new carrier will have an electromagnetic catapult to efficiently sling fighter jets off its deck - the biggest question mark over current Chinese carrier technology. The USS Gerald R. Ford, commissioned in 2017, was the first carrier to include the cutting-edge feature.  Still, "the Chinese are showing tremendous capability of designing and fitting out vessels," Funaiole said. "It's moving along on pace. It's impressive the process they're going through to position themselves at the forefront of carrier technology."  The progress of China's third carrier has been of intense interest in rival capitals as well as inside China, where it is seen as a tangible symbol of the country's development into a global power boasting a modern, world-class military. China has commissioned two carriers in the past decade: the Liaoning was a retrofit of an old Soviet model and the second, the Shandong, was...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - One tweet claimed coronavirus numbers were intentionally inflated, adding, "It's hard to know what to believe." Another warned, "Don't trust Dr. Fauci."  A Facebook comment argued that mail-in ballots "will lead to fraud for this election," while an Instagram comment amplified the erroneous claim that 28 million ballots went missing in the past four elections.  The messages have been emanating in recent months from the accounts of young people in Arizona seemingly expressing their own views - standing up for President Donald Trump in a battleground state and echoing talking points from his reelection campaign.  Far from representing a genuine social media groundswell, however, the posts are the product of a sprawling yet secretive campaign that experts say evades the guardrails put in place by social media companies to limit online disinformation of the sort used by Russia during the 2016 campaign.  Teenagers, some of them minors, are being paid to pump out the messages at the direction of Turning Point Action, an affiliate of Turning Point USA, a prominent conservative youth organization based in Phoenix, according to four people with independent knowledge of the effort. Their descriptions were confirmed by detailed notes from relatives of one of the teenagers who recorded conversations with him about the efforts.  The campaign draws on the spam-like behavior of bots and trolls, with the same or similar language posted repeatedly across social media. But it is carried out, at least in part, by humans paid to use their own accounts, though nowhere disclosing their relationship with Turning Point Action or the digital firm brought in to oversee the day-to-day activity. One user included a link to Turning Point USA's website in his Twitter profile until The Washington Post began asking questions about the...</description>

      <title>MAGA rallies getting less coverage on TV news...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/entertainment/article/Trump-s-rallies-getting-less-coverage-on-TV-news-15566635.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's campaign rallies are getting less attention on television this election cycle. Particularly when they're held indoors, during a global pandemic, like his campaign stop in Henderson, Nev., on Sunday night.  Compared with coverage of his rallies during the 2016 election cycle, the major broadcast and cable news networks have been less likely to go live with the president on the stump.  The one holdout typically has been Fox News though the president's favorite channel lately has been prone to cut in and out through parts of the speech that meander or conflict with its high-rated prime-time pundits.  But when the president spoke at the Xtreme Manufacturing facility Sunday, Fox did not broadcast the rally. None of the major networks did. Not even C-SPAN, which historically broadcasts his rallies as something of a public service for viewers.  For health reasons, correspondents and camera crews for the leading broadcast and cable news networks mostly reported from outside the facility. The indoor rally was held in violation of state's coronavirus regulations, drawing the ire of Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, who called it "shameful, dangerous and irresponsible."  It was the campaign's first indoor rally since it held an event in Tulsa, Okla., in June. Former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain appeared at that rally without wearing a mask, was hospitalized several days later and eventually died of covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus; a local reporter who covered the rally, Paul Monies of Oklahoma Watch, said he later tested positive for the coronavirus and was asymptomatic.  Representatives for NBC News and CBS News, which kept their correspondents outside, told The Washington Post on Monday that their networks follow public health...</description>

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/937587/trump-says-hell-fox--friends-every-week--but-host-steve-doocy-doesnt-agree-have</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump is apparently under the impression he has a standing weekly date with the hosts of Fox &amp; Friends — but they might not be on board. Trump on Tuesday appeared on Fox &amp; Friends for another lengthy phone interview, and at the top of the conversation, he informed viewers that this would be a weekly occurrence going forward. 'We've agreed to do it once a week in the morning, and I look forward to it,' Trump said. But it's unclear who the 'we' in that sentence was considering host Steve Doocy expressed surprise at this news, responding, 'I haven't heard that.' Later, after a conversation that lasted nearly 50 minutes, Trump reiterated that viewers should tune in next Monday for more. But this time, Doocy made clear that this arrangement has not been agreed upon by Fox News at all. 'You may want to do it every week, but Fox is not committed to that,' Doocy told Trump. 'We're going to take it on a case by case basis.' Doocy's co-host Brian Kilmeade looked completely bewildered as he made this declaration on the air, possibly as he processed the fact that the network might soon have to start ghosting the president of the United States. Brendan Morrow Donald Trump: 'We're gonna [call into Fox &amp; Friends] every week. Every Monday I think they said.' Brian Kilmeade: 'Sounds good.' Steve Doocy, after Trump hangs up: 'You may want to do it every week, but Fox is not committed to that, and we'll take it on a case-by-case basis.' pic.twitter.com/VnIHyofm36 — Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) September 15, 2020</description>
