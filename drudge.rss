      <title>Uses Rose Garden event for extended attack on Biden...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-uses-Rose-Garden-event-for-extended-attack-15408585.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Tuesday held a Rose Garden event under the guise of punishing China over its crackdown on Hong Kong, delivering a lengthy diatribe against Democratic rival Joe Biden in a display that resembled a campaign speech at the White House.  The president began his rambling 54-minute opening statement by announcing that he had signed congressional legislation that authorizes his administration to enact sanctions on banks that do business with Chinese officials and an executive order to revoke Hong Kong's special economic trading status. But he glossed over the specifics and said nothing about the pro-democracy protests on the island as he pivoted swiftly to his attacks on Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.  Trump lambasted Biden's record on Beijing, casting the former vice president and longtime senator from Delaware as soft on China during its rise to become the second-largest economy in the world. He faulted Biden for initially opposing his administration's decision to shut down some flights from China over the coronavirus, and he inaccurately stated that Biden "sided with China" on its handling of the pandemic - even though Biden had sounded alarms months ago as Trump was still praising Chinese President Xi Jinping.  And he suggested that Biden has been critical of the United States while rooting for China's economic success, citing a July 4 video message during which Biden had stated that U.S. history was "no fairy tale."  "Joe Biden's entire career has been a gift to the Chinese Communist Party," Trump said.  "He said the idea that China is our competitor is really bizarre. He's really bizarre," the president said. "Nobody's ripped us off more than China the last 25-30 years - nobody close - and he says China's not a problem? He wants to take it all back now. He...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A pair of prominent writers announced they're leaving their prominent publications Tuesday. The resignations appear to be related to recent debates within the wider media landscape about the alleged stifling of public discourse. Bari Weiss, a former op-ed staff editor and writer for The New York Times, resigned from the newspaper today, while prominent New York writer Andrew Sullivan announced this would be his last week at the magazine. In a lengthy resignation letter addressed to Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger, Weiss said she made her decision because she became the 'subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree' with her 'centrist' views and that 'intellectual curiosity' has become a 'liability' at the Times. NEW: Bari Weiss has published her resignation letter to publisher A.G. Sulzberger https://t.co/FZLfuqzRMQ pic.twitter.com/OKgSYKGBCG â€” Jeremy Barr (@jeremymbarr) July 14, 2020 Sullivan, meanwhile, tweeted his news, noting that he has 'no beef' with his colleagues, but hinted he's leaving over ideological differences and will explain more fully in his final New York column slated for Friday. Tim O'Donnell I've been preparing for this eventuality, and the column will continue elsewhere. See you on Friday, when I'll detail some exciting news. â€” Andrew Sullivan (@sullydish) July 14, 2020</description>

      <title>Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Diego to keep classrooms shut...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Atlanta-L-A-San-Diego-to-keep-schools-closed-15405751.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resisting pressure from President Donald Trump, three of the nation's largest school districts said Monday that they will begin the new school year with all students learning from home.  Schools in Los Angeles, San Diego and Atlanta will begin entirely online, officials said Monday. Schools in Nashville plan to do the same, at least through Labor Day.  Several other big cities were considering similar plans, while others have adopted hybrid plans through which students would be in school on certain days and at home on others. Some have announced plans to open five days a week, as the White House has demanded, but they appear to be in the minority.  The decisions are another sign that the coronavirus pandemic will continue to wreak havoc on fundamental aspects of American life, and the economy, well into fall. Many parents who need to work will be left scrambling for child care. And while some schools found success with virtual school in the spring, it was a disaster for many, with little indication it will be drastically better in the new school year. In some ways, it may be more challenging because students will be starting with new teachers who do not know them.  Still, some school leaders are concluding that the risk to students and staff members is too great to allow in-person education of any kind.  "The skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control," said a joint statement from the Los Angeles and San Diego districts. They said they would return to in-person learning later in the academic year, "as soon as public health conditions allow."  Monday's developments from California and Georgia, two states with surging rates of coronavirus infection, reflect the deep divide that has opened over the risks and benefits of in-person school. Trump and his senior aides...</description>

      <title>Anti-maskers put shops, businesses on edge...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/business/article/Anti-maskers-put-shops-businesses-on-edge-15406410.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily Damtew had resolved to permanently shutter her Ethiopian coffee shop after a maskless man spat at her feet and hurled chicken and rice at her window when she asked him to cover his face. How could she brew coffee and cut quiche, she thought, in fear that he would return with a vengeance?  But on Saturday, just before 7:30 a.m., six days after the incident at Abyssinia Market and Coffee House, she flipped her wooden door sign to "Open" and stood armed with a mask, a face shield and three neighborhood friends.  "I see you're open. That takes a lot of courage," said Mark Lewis, the first customer of the day, who ordered an almond croissant that filled the room with an aroma of butter and sugar.  "It was this neighborhood that changed my mind," Damtew replied. She gestured to the rows of Post-it notes with well-wishes that covered her storefront in Old Town Alexandria, Va. "But I was scared."  Damtew's experience, part of the coronavirus culture war over face coverings, reflects a growing problem for retail and service workers across the country who are yelled at and sometimes assaulted after asking patrons to wear masks. They have become the primary enforcers for social distancing guidelines inside restaurants and shops, often drawing the ire of people who think mask requirements infringe on their rights.  In Florida, a maskless man was recorded on video shoving a Walmart employee who tried to block him from entering the store. At a Family Dollar store in Michigan, a security guard was killed after trying to enforce mask requirements. A Starbucks customer in California launched an expletive-laden tirade and social media blast against a barista who asked that she wear a mask.  In the Washington region, retail workers are similarly confronting aggressive anti-maskers.  Days...</description>
