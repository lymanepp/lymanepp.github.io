      <title>Dozens Storm Gates At Lollapalooza...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stereogum.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The kids love storming things these days ‚Äî watch out, Area 51! ‚Äî and yesterday, it was Lollapalooza's turn. Dozens of aspiring festivalgoers stormed the gates at Lollapalooza, hopping over the fence en masse. According to footage posted online, the cops guarding the festival only managed to stop one guy with a prosthetic leg, which doesn't even seem fair. Over 100 people just stormed the fence at Lollapalooza‚Ä¶ one guy got caught. üòÇ pic.twitter.com/4igQeBA4Kb‚Äî Armand*s Milk (@nucklehead103) August 2, 2019 Nonetheless, officials claim that no one actually managed to storm their way into the festival: "Statement re: the attempted breach of an exterior perimeter fence at Lolla today. Our robust security plan, which includes multiple layers of fences worked. No one gained entry. Note to anyone who's thinking about trying it: offenders will be charged with criminal trespass." Multiple fences? What is this sorcery? Statement re: the attempted breach of an exterior perimeter</description>

      <title>Paramount and paranoid: China's Xi faces crisis of confidence...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Paramount-and-paranoid-China-s-Xi-faces-a-crisis-14278079.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHANGHAI - Chinese scholars and Communist Party cadres have a succinct way of describing the tectonic shifts taking place here: Deng Xiaoping made us rich, now Xi Jinping is making us strong.  The phrase sums up China's economic rise that began under Deng four decades ago, and the hopes for a similarly significant geopolitical realignment under the current president.  Xi has devoted his seven years in power to strengthening the ruling Communist Party, and by extension the country. He has relentlessly quashed dissent, sidelined rivals and demanded absolute loyalty.  After pledging to make the party "north, south, east and west," he has ensured that it is paramount not just in policymaking but in the military, business, education and the law.  Now, Xi is facing challenges on multiple fronts and the Communist Party, riven with paranoia at the best of times, is seeing threats at every turn.  He has to contend not just with a slowing economy but also a protracted trade war with the United States, that has entered a new confrontational phase with President Donald Trump's decision to impose more tariffs next month.  He is facing escalating Western criticism of Chinese policies toward ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang, where as many as 3 million people have been put into reeducation camps. He is dealing with an increasingly assertive Taiwan at the same time as a pro-democracy movement swells in Hong Kong.  All of these loom as dangers to Xi's authority as the party's general secretary and are heightening a sense of alarm within a party long fearful of external threats.  "A strong party is the key to a successful China, in Xi's eyes. It is also the only way to fend off enemies abroad, most notably the U.S.," said Richard McGregor, an expert on the party and the author of a new book about...</description>

      <title>Republican anxiety spikes after retirements, Dem gains in Texas...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/GOP-anxiety-spikes-after-retirements-Democratic-14277128.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Republicans have long idealized Texas as a deep-red frontier state, home to rural conservatives who love President Donald Trump. But political turbulence in the sprawling suburbs and fast-growing cities are turning the Lone Star State into a possible 2020 battleground.  "The president's reelection campaign needs to take Texas seriously," Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in an interview. He added that while he remains optimistic about the GOP's chances, it is "by no means a given" that Trump will carry Texas - and win its 38 electoral votes - next year or that Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, will be reelected.  For a state that once elevated the Bush family and was forged into a Republican stronghold by Karl Rove, it is an increasingly uncertain time. Changing demographics and a wave of liberal activism have given new hope to Democrats, who have not won a statewide elected office since 1994 or Texas' presidential vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976.  Recent Republican congressional retirements have stoked party concerns, particularly the surprising Thursday announcement by a rising star, Rep. Will Hurd, that he would not seek reelection in his highly competitive district, which stretches east from El Paso along the Mexican border.  Days earlier, Rep. K. Michael Conaway, a powerful former committee chairman from West Texas, announced that he would not run again, as did Rep. Pete Olson, who narrowly won his seat in 2018. Two years earlier, Olson carried his suburban, Houston-area district by 19 percentage points.  Hurd, the lone black Republican in the House, said Trump's incendiary rhetoric on immigration amid a humanitarian crisis at the border has left him and other Texas Republicans unsettled about the GOP's future with minority voters.  "When you look at trends, the two largest...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple Inc. said on Friday that the company would stop using contractors to listen in on users through Siri to grade the voice assistant's accuracy.  An Apple whistleblower told The Guardian that contractors who were responsible for "grading" the accuracy of Siri regularly heard recordings of doctors' appointments, drug deals and couples having sex. Their job was to determine the trigger to activate Siri - if the user had actually said "Hey, Siri" or if it was something else, such as the sound of a zipper.  Apple announced that it is suspending global analysis of those voice recordings until it can thoroughly review the program. For future software updates and review, users will be able to opt-out.  "We are committed to delivering a great Siri experience while protecting user privacy," Apple said in a statement to The Guardian on Friday.  The data was used "to help Siri and dictation . . . understand you better and recognize what you say," Apple told The Guardian. But this wasn't made clear to users in Apple's terms and conditions.  "There have been countless instances of recordings featuring private discussions between doctors and patients, business deals, seemingly criminal dealings, sexual encounters and so on," the Apple whistleblower told The Guardian, highlighting the Apple Watch and HomePod smart speaker as especially prone to mistakes. "These recordings are accompanied by user data showing location, contact details, and app data."  In response, Apple said the recordings from users weren't matched up with their Apple IDs, and that the recordings only account for 1 percent of Siri activations and last for just a few seconds.</description>
