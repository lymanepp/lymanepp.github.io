      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Pop-culture-needs-to-go-nuclear-again-13650635.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever happens as President Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to talk about Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, the risk of a devastating nuclear conflict appears higher now than at any time since the Cold War. And yet, pop culture has more or less stopped warning us of the dangers of atomic devastation - and that's too bad. We need fresh stories to help us understand the renewed and complex risks we face, and to nudge us out of our complacency. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set the infamous Doomsday Clock at two minutes to midnight in January 2018, making this our closest call since the 1950s.</description>
