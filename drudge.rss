      <title>Shots fired on India-China border first time in decades as tensions flare...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Shots-fired-on-the-India-China-border-for-the-15549227.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW DELHI - India and China accused each other on Tuesday of firing warning shots during a confrontation the day before at their disputed border in a marked escalation of tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.  It was the first time in decades that shots were fired at the shared frontier, where longstanding protocols observed by both countries forbid the use of firearms.  Such protocols did not prevent the two countries from engaging in their deadliest violence in nearly 50 years in June, when soldiers armed with clubs studded with nails and metal rods clashed in a remote area of the western Himalayas.  Twenty Indian soldiers were killed. The number of Chinese casualties remains unknown.  Both countries moved thousands of troops as well as tanks, artillery and fighter jets to areas close to the disputed and unmarked border, which is known as the Line of Actual Control. Despite numerous rounds of talks, tension remain high.  Col. Zhang Shuli, the spokesman for the People's Liberation Army western theater command, said in a statement early Tuesday that Indian troops "blatantly fired upon Chinese border patrols with threatening shots" near the southern bank of Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh. Chinese troops took unspecified "countermeasures" to stabilize the situation, he said.  "These are serious military provocations of a terrible nature," Zhang said. China demanded that India restrain its troops and punish the soldiers who fired their weapons.  India denied that its troops had used firearms. The Ministry of Defense released a statement saying that PLA soldiers were trying to "close-in" on a forward position on the border and "fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate" Indian troops.  An Indian official with knowledge of the incident who spoke on...</description>

      <title>House panel will investigate reports DeJoy pressured employees to make campaign donations...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/House-panel-will-investigate-reports-that-DeJoy-15548940.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - House Democrats are launching an investigation of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and called for his immediate suspension after reports that he reimbursed former employees for campaign contributions they made to his preferred GOP politicians, an arrangement that would be unlawful.  Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said in a statement late Monday that the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which she chairs, would begin an investigation, saying that DeJoy may have lied to her committee under oath.  Maloney also urged the U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors to immediately suspend DeJoy, who, she said, "they never should have hired in the first place."  A spokesman for the Postal Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Maloney's announcement came a day after The Washington Post reported allegations that DeJoy and his aides urged employees at his former North Carolina-based logistics company to write checks and attend fundraisers on behalf of Republican candidates.  DeJoy then defrayed the cost of those political contributions by boosting employee bonuses, two employees told The Post.  Although it can be permissible to encourage employees to make donations, reimbursing them for those contributions is a violation of North Carolina and federal election laws.  Such federal violations carry a five-year statute of limitations. There is no statute of limitations in North Carolina for felonies, including campaign finance violations.  Maloney said DeJoy faces "criminal exposure" not only if the allegations are true "but also for lying to our committee under oath."  Maloney was referring to DeJoy's testimony to the House Oversight and Reform Committee last month, when he forcefully denied that he had repaid executives for contributions they had made...</description>
