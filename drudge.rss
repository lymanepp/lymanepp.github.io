      <title>American deaths top 1,000, amid incomplete reporting... </title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/U-S-deaths-from-coronavirus-top-1-000-amid-15158939.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It began as a mysterious disease with frightening potential. Now, just two months after America's first confirmed case, the country is grappling with a lethal reality: The coronavirus has killed more than 1,000 people in the United States, a toll that is increasing at an alarming rate.  As the highly contagious virus has created clusters of illness, from Seattle to New York City, death has followed in turn. On Wednesday night, the country's largest city reported 88 new deaths from covid-19. Americans have died in 42 states and territories and the District, with punishing increases in Louisiana and Michigan. Experts fear the worst is still to come, pointing to a rapid acceleration of cases in communities across the country.  The Washington Post is tracking every known U.S. death, analyzing data from health agencies and gathering details from family and friends of the victims. In the first 1,000 fatalities, some patterns have begun to emerge in the outbreak's epidemiology and its painful human impact. About 65% of people whose ages are known were older than 70 and nearly 40% were over 80, a risk that rises along with age. About 5% whose ages are known were in their 40s or younger, but many more in that age group have been sick enough to be hospitalized. Nearly 60% of the dead were men.  What remains murky is exactly who is dying in America during the pandemic, even as scientists and public health experts race to uncover information that can help save lives.  Overwhelmed state and local authorities have been issuing widely varying reports on those who died, citing medical privacy laws to shield even basic details about age, gender and underlying conditions, the three signal categories that epidemiologists say are key indicators of risk.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which offers a well-regarded and...</description>

      <title>Escaping coronavirus anxiety in the Texas desert...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Escaping-coronavirus-anxiety-in-the-Texas-desert-15158219.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MARATHON, Texas - There were no lines, but the shelves were just as empty as any store across the country, unless you were in the market for a snake or two.  Along Highway 90 near Big Bend National Park, in one of the most desolate parts of West Texas, Target Marathon, as it is known locally, was open for business, though not the kind one might expect.  About four years ago, an unidentified artist transformed an old cinder block railroad building into a tiny fake Target store, complete with the retail chain's familiar red bull's eye logo. Some interpreted it as the equalizing cousin to Prada Marfa, an art installation located in an equally remote roadside spot about an hour down the road.  But unlike Prada Marfa, a faux retail store that showcases a display of Prada purses and shoes behind a reinforced glass storefront, Target Marathon has no stock - just a red shopping cart parked out front, a prop for those who venture deep into the Chihuahuan Desert to find it.  In recent days, the tiny Target has taken on a new kind of visitor - people who have come to what some around here describe as the end of the earth to practice a kind of extreme social distancing to avoid catching the novel coronavirus and find some respite from the unsettling headlines, even if it is only between pockets of working cellular coverage.  On a recent afternoon, Sarah McGraw, a 41-year-old photographer from Greenville, South Carolina, pulled up in a large white van that she had purchased about a year ago to travel across the country, hiking and backpacking in national parks. But the purchase has taken on a new usefulness in recent weeks.  McGraw, who specializes in pet portraiture for personal and commercial clients, had been in Phoenix for an assignment when the coronavirus pandemic began shutting down much of the country. She retreated into her...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.zdnet.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's unlikely one single, long stretch of "social distancing" is going to solve COVID-19 for the US before a vaccine arrives, say Harvard researchers. Instead, it may be necessary to keep having periodic intervals of quarantine until the US healthcare system is fortified.</description>
