      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/lifestyle/article/David-Muir-reflects-on-letting-people-tell-their-14116070.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Muir, 45, is the anchor of ABC's "World News With David Muir" and co-anchor of its newsmagazine, "20/20." Muir has won the Edward R. Murrow Award for his reporting at home and abroad.  - - -  A: I was a total nerd. [Laughs.] I was the kid in the backyard who would be playing with everybody else, but then would excuse myself to go inside to watch the news every night - the local news, and then Peter Jennings.  A: Everybody knew. Which played into that whole nerd status. I even remember trying to guess on Fridays who the Person of the Week was, because oftentimes Peter would provide a clue throughout the newscast.  I started writing to local news reporters in town when I was 13; I remember racing out to the mailbox at the end of the driveway to see if someone had written me back. One of the anchors, who was considered, you know, the Walter Cronkite of my hometown, wrote back. I still have the typewritten letter with that giant newsroom font. The last line said something along the lines of, "Competition in television news is keen. There's always room for the right person. It could be you." After that, I set up a visit at that TV station, and then began interning at 14, carrying the tripods and equipment. I was so happy to be doing that. And to this day I am grateful to those photographers and reporters who let me bum around in the back seat of that cruiser.  A; I think about it every day, to be honest with you. I'm fully aware that when I go upstairs - that same stairwell that Peter [Jennings] took and Charlie [Gibson] took and Diane [Sawyer] took - and walk up to that desk, that I'm having a conversation with America in a very polarized time. And it has evolved quickly into a two-way conversation - through social media and all the tools we have to reach out to the audience and for them to let us know in an instant...</description>

      <title>Never-Googlers: Web users take ultimate step to guard data...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Never-Googlers-Web-users-take-the-ultimate-step-14116157.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN FRANCISCO - In the small South Carolina town of Newberry, Bob's Red Mill muesli cereal is hard to come by.  That presents a challenge for resident Gregory Kelly, who can't get enough of the stuff. He'd rather not truck the 40 miles or so to Columbia to stock up on it, but he's also loath to buy it from the company's website, which he says is riddled with tracking software from Google.  His privacy being paramount, Kelly grudgingly chooses to head into Columbia every so often, rather than cede his data to Google or turn over his purchase history to another online retailer. "I'm just not sure why Google needs to know what breakfast cereal I eat," the 51-year-old said.  Kelly is one of a hearty few who are taking the ultimate step to keep their files and online life safe from prying eyes: turning off Google entirely. That means eschewing some of the most popular services on the Web, including Gmail, Google search, Google Maps, the Chrome browser, Android mobile operating software and even YouTube.  Such never-Googlers are pushing friends and family to give up the search and advertising titan, while others are taking to social media to get word out. Online guides have sprouted up to help consumers untangle themselves from Google.  These intrepid Web users say they'd rather deal with daily inconveniences than give up more of their data. That means setting up permanent vacation responders on Gmail and telling friends to resend files or video links that don't require Google software. More than that, it takes a lot of discipline.  People like Kelly are trying to build barriers to Google and other tech giants largely due to increasing concerns about the massive data collection. A series of privacy scandals showing how these companies collect and use consumer data has raised alarm bells for many people about how much they've...</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/As-Hong-Kong-police-face-protester-anger-some-14115723.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HONG KONG - The 29-year-old police officer was nearing the 24th hour of his shift last month, standing with his unit between a throng of protesters and Hong Kong's most important government building, when the order came down: It was time to escalate.  Edward suited up. He donned his gas mask as officers readied tear-gas canisters.  The stinging clouds came thick and fast, along with rounds of rubber bullets. The crowd scattered. Officers rushed masked young protesters, thumping them with batons.  He did not want to follow those orders on June 12. This was not the side he wanted to be on.  Five years ago, Edward was camped out with other protesters on Hong Kong streets, calling for free elections. Those demonstrations failed to achieve their aims but invigorated a generation of young activists frustrated by China's refusal to grant the semiautonomous city full democracy.  This time, Edward - who joined the force in 2015 because of the relatively high salaries - has been an officer stationed on the front lines of almost every major protest during weeks of anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong.  "I didn't expect I would ever be standing opposite to the action," said Edward, who wanted to be identified by only his first name because he was not authorized to speak to the media. "I understand the protesters. Really, I feel like I am one of them."  Once known as "Asia's Finest," the Hong Kong Police Force has been caught between a furious public - angered by officials' plans to allow extraditions to mainland China - and Hong Kong's pro-Beijing government.  The police have faced intense criticism of their tactics, from the use of tear gas and rubber bullets to tardiness in responding to emergency calls when an armed gang attacked people returning from a demonstration late...</description>

      <title>POLL: Even most DEMS don't want border crossings decriminalized...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/854249/even-most-democrats-dont-support-decriminalizing-border-crossings-poll-finds</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing is not a particularly popular idea among Americans, a new NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll suggests. In total, 66 percent of those surveyed think it's a bad idea, compared to just 27 percent who support it. The debate is more split among party lines, with 87 percent of Republicans opposed compared to 47 percent of Democrats. The Democrats are split internally, as well, as 54 percent of self-identified "progressive" Democrats believe decriminalization is a "good idea," while only 34 percent of "moderate" Democrats feel the same. Is decriminalizing border crossings a good idea/bad idea:Registered Voters: 27/67Democrats: 45/47 (!!!!)Republicans: 10/87 (libertarians lol)Independents: 24/68Moderate Dems: 34/58Progressive Dems: 54/37Whites: 26/68Non-Whites: 28/63Millennials/Gen-Z: 31/59 â€” Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) July 22, 2019 There is little variation regionally (all regions hover between 66 and 67 percent in the "bad idea" category), racially (68 percent of white voters and 63 percent of non-white voters think it's a bad idea), or economically (those who make more than $50,000 per year oppose decriminalization at a 70 percent clip, while those making less oppose it at 63 percent.) There are larger gaps between men (75 percent for bad idea) and women (57 percent), as well as among age groups, with 76 percent those between the ages of 39 and 54 opposing decriminalization, compared to 59 percent between the ages of 18 and 38. Similarly, among adults over the age of 73, 60 percent think it's a bad idea. Essentially, the poll indicates that political persuasion is the most important indicator when it comes to stances on the issue. That's not great news for Democratic presidential candidates like former Housing Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro who have pushed for decriminalizing crossings, as only the progressive left appears staunchly in favor. The poll surveyed 1,346 adults in the United States over the phone between July 15 and July 17. The margin of error ranged from 3.5 to 5.4 percentage points across the survey's subsets. See the results on page 13 and page 26 at Marist Poll. Tim O'Donnell</description>
