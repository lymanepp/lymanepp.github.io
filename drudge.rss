      <title>PAPER: Senate likelier to remove than think...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/The-Senate-is-likelier-to-remove-Trump-after-14514050.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the House of Representatives builds momentum to impeach President Donald Trump, conventional wisdom holds that the constitutionally required two-thirds vote in the Senate to remove him would be impossible.  This conventional wisdom is wrong.  While getting rid of the president this way remains far from certain, it's more likely than most observers will admit. And it's becoming a stronger possibility day by day as Trump's foreign policy stumbles remind GOP senators that speaking out against the president doesn't have to be political suicide.  Historically inclined naysayers cite the acquittals of our only two impeached presidents as support for the argument that Trump won't be removed. Those examples, both of which ended with the commander in chief beating the charges against him and serving out his full term, on first blush do appear to bolster that case.  Andrew Johnson's experience in particular astounds to this day. After that president's egregious behavior and manifest unfitness for office got him impeached by the Republican-dominated House in 1868, the Senate failed to remove him from office - by one vote. That result came despite the GOP holding a greater-than-two-thirds majority in the Senate.  The wrong lesson, however, can be taken from Johnson's nonconviction. Senators allowed the president to remain in place partly because they suspected the law that the president had violated to prompt his impeachment, the Tenure of Office Act, itself stood on particularly shaky ground. (It was, in fact, later ruled unconstitutional.) Other articles of impeachment against Johnson included "crimes" like speaking ill of Congress in public - which may very well have contravened a lingering norm from the early days of the republic but fell very well short of warranting immediate ejection from the presidency.  It's hard to...</description>

      <title>Farmers kept refusing to let him have sex with their animals. So he sought revenge...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Farmers-kept-refusing-to-let-him-have-sex-with-14514093.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For well over a year, two mysteries consumed a peaceful New Jersey community. There were the strange letters that showed up in the mailboxes of local barns, asking about the possibility of forming a "sexual relationship" with horses, cows or other large animals. And then, there were the homemade tire-slashing devices that farmers kept finding in their driveways, or near the entrances to rural farm roads.  Now, authorities in Sussex County, New Jersey, are saying that both were the work of the same man, Richard Decker, who lashed out by harassing people who refused to let him have sex with their farm animals.  The 31-year-old was arrested Oct. 3, according to the New Jersey Herald. Prosecutors said at a Wednesday detention hearing that since August 2018, he had been sending letters and emails detailing his request to farms, stables and horse boarding facilities throughout Sussex County, located in the northernmost point of the state. Unsurprisingly, many of the recipients were not thrilled to learn than an adult man was interested in having a sexual relationship with their livestock.  Decker didn't take the rejection well, authorities said on Wednesday. He left messages harassing the property owners who had turned him down - in one instance threatening to beat a man's wife with a wooden stick - and wrote negative online reviews of their businesses. The 31-year-old also allegedly kept a stash of homemade metal tire deflation spikes in his bedroom, and would plant them in the driveways of farmers who angered him.  In January, police in Decker's hometown of Vernon Township, New Jersey, issued a warning to "anyone who has farm-like property" after several residents found that their tires had been destroyed by homemade spikes, which are also known as caltrops. The department's Facebook post was deluged with comments from...</description>

      <title>WHO IS PAYING RUDY?</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/We-have-no-idea-who-is-paying-Rudy-Giuliani-14506916.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rudy Giuliani is not the secretary of state. In fact, he has no official position in President Donald Trump's Cabinet or administration. Yet he is traveling the world holding himself out as a U.S. government operative, engaging in some unknown amount of "unofficial" diplomacy and insisting his work is not only officially sanctioned by the president but also assisted by the State Department. The president's "private lawyer" is not charging Trump for his services, but he and his law firm are known to have dozens of clients - including foreign entities - who are paying for whatever services they think Giuliani can provide for them.  That is a very convenient setup for Giuliani - but it leaves the public in the dark about the wealthy special interests who might be subsidizing his gratis work for Trump - or for whom he might actually be working while invoking Trump's name and that of the State Department. Because Giuliani is not officially a federal employee, he can sidestep ethics obligations that would require transparency behind the foreign or domestic interests who are paying him.  Giuliani appears to have spearheaded Trump's efforts to convince the Ukrainian president to open an investigation into Trump's political rivals. Text messages released by Congress also show he was steering U.S. policy in Ukraine in a direction that alarmed career State Department officials, who thought it harmed U.S. interests there. Giuliani himself has boasted that he effectively had official imprimatur for what might appear to have been freelance diplomacy with Kiev: Appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation" on Sept. 29, Giuliani said about his outreach to Ukraine: "I did not do this on my own. I did it at the request of the State Department, and I have all of the text messages to prove it."  Despite playing such an important role in U.S....</description>

      <title>National security officials raised alarms about Ukraine policy before and after Trump call... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Several-national-security-officials-raised-alarms-14510135.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - At least four national security officials were so alarmed by the Trump administration's attempts to pressure Ukraine for political purposes that they raised concerns with a White House lawyer both before and immediately after President Donald Trump's July 25 call with that country's president, according to U.S. officials and other people familiar with the matter.  The nature and timing of the previously undisclosed discussions with National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg indicate that officials were delivering warnings through official White House channels earlier than previously understood - including before the call that precipitated a whistleblower complaint and the impeachment inquiry of the president.  At the time, the officials were unnerved by the removal in May of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine; subsequent efforts by Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani to promote Ukraine-related conspiracies; as well as signals in meetings at the White House that Trump wanted the new government in Kiev to deliver material that might be politically damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.  Those concerns soared in the call's aftermath, officials said. Within minutes, senior officials including national security adviser John Bolton were being pinged by subordinates about problems with what the president had said to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. Bolton and others scrambled to obtain a rough transcript that was already being "locked down" on a highly classified computer network.  "When people were listening to this in real time there were significant concerns about what was going on - alarm bells were kind of ringing," said one person familiar with the sequence of events inside the White House, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter....</description>

      <title>Kellyanne and George Conway's tawdry love triangle with all of us...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Kellyanne-and-George-Conway-s-tawdry-love-14504402.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm beginning to wonder whether George and Kellyanne Conway have enlisted us all into a private fetish - a relationship-spicing exercise defined by mutual debasement and public shame. We now know too much about the marriage between two prominent Republicans. Not the nitty-gritty of who snores and who loads the dishwasher wrong, but the vast cosmic business, like who has apparently lost all semblance of respect for who's lifelong wedded partner.  George Conway, according to the succinct bio accompanying the essays he publishes in national media sharply criticizing the Trump administration, is "a lawyer in New York." Which is true, but this description is like calling George W. Bush "a painter with an exhibit at the Kennedy Center." Also true, weirdly, but that's not why anybody's buying tickets.  George Conway is known for is being a vehement Never Trumper, but what he's really known for is being the husband of Kellyanne Conway. Who is herself a senior counselor to President Donald Trump.  George has become the toast of the resistance. Not because of what he says; scores of learned experts have spent the past three years furiously penning similar arguments. He has become the toast of the resistance mostly because we know who his wife is. He's riding her coattails while on an apparent mission that would, ultimately, put her out of a job. Which makes the whole thing more ... diabolical? More squalid? More delicious?  "There is a cancer in the presidency," George wrote in April; in June he described one of Trump's briefs as "spectacularly anti-constitutional." He seemed to peak in July, calling his wife's boss "racist," as well as "boorish, dim-witted, inarticulate, incoherent, narcissistic and insensitive." Then, last week he hit a new apex with a massive 12,000 word piece in the Atlantic, whose scathing contents, while...</description>
