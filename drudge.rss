      <title>Bernie gets tough reception at minority women's event, signaling challenges ahead... </title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Sanders-gets-tough-reception-at-minority-women-s-13793574.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOUSTON - The groans erupted halfway through Bernie Sanders' appearance Wednesday at a presidential candidates' forum sponsored by She the People, a group that aims to drive up voter participation among women of color.  Before an audience of about 1,700, many of them African-American and Hispanic women, the moderator asked Sanders, I-Vt., how he would handle the rise in white supremacy. Sanders spoke of fighting discrimination and running a campaign "to bring our people together around an agenda that speaks to all people" - then returned to a familiar message on universal health care.  For many in the audience, that was insufficient. "Come on!" a woman shouted from the back, as others began to jeer and boo.  The reception reflected Sanders' struggle to win support from minority voters, a problem that dogged his 2016 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. Sanders has taken steps since to improve his outreach, including meeting with black leaders and talking more frequently about the difficulties facing minorities, but Wednesday's event suggested the senator still faces challenges.  Sanders at one point mentioned his long record on civil rights, but it did little to mollify the crowd.  "I was actually at the March on Washington with Dr. King back in 1963, and - as somebody who actively supported Jesse Jackson's campaign, as one of the few white elected officials to do so in '88 - I have dedicated my life to the fight against racism and sexism and discrimination of all forms," Sanders said. That prompted audible groans.  Sanders may have come into the event at a disadvantage, since many black women supported Clinton in 2016. Some Clinton backers believe Sanders did too little to help her after she won the nomination.  Sanders did eventually coax a warmer reception when he...</description>

      <title>High school's new dress code bans leggings, pajamas -- for parents...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-high-school-s-new-dress-code-bans-leggings-13791086.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not exactly unusual for school dress codes to become a source of controversy. But the latest flare-up has a new twist: This time, it's parents being told what they can and can't wear on campus.  As the Houston Chronicle first reported, one high school principal warned parents earlier this month that they will be turned away if they show up at their child's school wearing hair rollers, leggings, silk bonnets or any other items on a list of banned clothing. The announcement followed a widely publicized incident in which a prospective parent was turned away from the school for showing up in a T-shirt dress and headscarf.  "We are preparing your child for a prosperous future," Carlotta Outley Brown, the principal of James Madison High School in Houston, wrote in a letter to parents on April 9. "We want them to know what is appropriate and what is not appropriate for any setting they might be in."  To many parents, KTRK reported, the dress code appeared to be laden with racial undertones. For one thing, it didn't apply to the whole school district, just to one high school with a majority of minority and low-income students. According to the Houston Independent School District, 58 percent of the students at Madison High School are Hispanic, and 40 percent are African American. Nearly three-quarters of the students are eligible for free and reduced-price lunch.  "I'm almost insulted," said Tomiko Miller, the mother of a current student, told the Chronicle. "I really think it was discriminatory, the language that was used. It was demeaning. And I'm African American - and if it's misty outside and I have a hair bonnet on, I don't see how that's anyone's business."  In her letter to parents, Brown wrote that sagging pants or shorts were off limits, and men couldn't arrive in undershirts. Low-cut tops were banned, as were...</description>

      <link>https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/texas/article/White-presidential-candidates-face-woke-litmus-13790431.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.houstonchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOUSTON (AP) — After touring the National Lynching Memorial recently, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper spoke of the "shame" he felt that some white people "kind of looked the other way during these lynching incidents." Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas has acknowledged he "clearly had advantages" as a white man. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has said that any struggle she faced as a single mom was much more challenging for black women. U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio has talked about not knowing many black people when he was growing up. And Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, recently said , "Any white candidate needs to show a level of consciousness around issues like white privilege." Such rhetoric surrounding race is becoming what Democratic strategist Joel Payne called a "woke litmus test" for any white person who wants to win the Democratic presidential nomination. In a field celebrated for its historic racial and gender diversity, white candidates are talking about systemic racism and white privilege to connect with voters of color and prove that America's racial divisions aren't lost on them. "All candidates, especially nonethnic minority candidates, need to be fluent in the issues that matter most to black America — police brutality, criminal justice reform, reparations, social justice," said Payne, an alumnus of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. White presidential candidates are among the contenders who will have another chance to connect with voters of color on Wednesday at the She the People forum in Houston. The event, which is focused on women of color, includes O'Rourke, Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont as speakers. There are clear risks to Democrats who embrace talk of white privilege. Candidates could lose the moderate white men who live in suburbs...</description>

      <title>America's new pastime? Milking goats...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/America-s-new-pastime-Milking-goats-13788459.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most popular milk worldwide comes out of goats. The U.S., where cow is queen, is an outlier. But new data shows that even in America, dairy goats are having a moment.  Dairy goats herds expanded faster than any other major livestock group in the U.S. over the past decade. They've grown 61 percent between 2007 and 2017, according to the USDA's latest Census of Agriculture, a once-every-five-years inventory of the nation's farms. For context, broiler hens and beef cattle were relatively flat and numbers for specialty animals such as llamas, ostriches and emus fell off a cliff.  The surge comes as goats have permeated pop culture. We've seen them frolicking and doing parkour while sporting adorable onesies on YouTube. We've maybe hoisted a 20-pound Nubian aloft in everybody's favorite novelty yoga practice. And rent-a-goats are running amok in Boise and helping clear brush and prevent wildfires in California.  Dairy-goat herds grew in all 48 states for which we have data. But the greatest increases came in the nation's three biggest goat-dairy states: Wisconsin (up 47,000), Iowa (up 18,000) and Texas (up 20,000).  Wisconsin's growth came even as the number of goat dairies in the state shrank and the number of goats per dairy soared, a sign of increasing consolidation in the industry.  According to Janet Fletcher, publisher of the Planet Cheese blog and author of three books on cheese, small-time goat-milkers are being bought out by those with enough cash to compete on a global scale. She points to the 2017 sale of Meyenberg Goat Milk Products of Turlock, California, and the 2015 sale of Redwood Hill Farm in Sebastopol, California. Both were scooped up by Swiss dairy giant Emmi, which also bought Cypress Grove Chèvre, makers of the cult cheese Humboldt Fog.  And at the end of 2017, Canadian dairy giant Saputo bought...</description>
