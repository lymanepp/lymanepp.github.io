      <title>Senators caught on hot mics...</title>
      <link>http://theweek.com/speedreads/793961/senators-cant-stop-themselves-from-revealingly-muttering-into-mic-during-kavanaugh-hearing</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It took mere minutes for the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to devolve into chaos Tuesday. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee joined with protesters to interrupt Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the committee chairman, during his opening statement, and the first hour of the hearing was quickly swallowed up by crosstalk. The "mob rule" vibe, as Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) called it at one point, led to some noteworthy whispered quips, as lawmakers kept reacting off-camera to the proceedings with their microphones still turned on. In the midst of some lively protests, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) can be overheard encouraging Grassley to "demand order," while at one point Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) noted reporting from NBC News' Kasie Hunt that the Democrats' disruption had been coordinated via a phone call Monday. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was not impressed with Tillis' point, muttering, "This is outrageous." .@SenThomTillis on report that @SenateDems plotted coordinated protest strategy: "None of the members on this committee participated in that phone call or that strategy before the documents were released yesterday? Are you suggesting that this allegation is false?" #SCOTUS pic.twitter.com/3soLcvMupj — CSPAN (@cspan) September 4, 2018 After Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said the hearing should be held according to the law, Cornyn contended that Democrats would be "held in contempt of court" for their behavior. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) was quick to react: "If this were a court of law that virtually every side, every members on the dais on that side would be held in contempt of court." https://t.co/1dlfnDZ07n pic.twitter.com/V2VbXlk0T3 — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) September 4, 2018 Protesters continued to disrupt the proceedings, prompting a fed-up Hatch to utter, "Get her thrown out of here, my God."

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh promised Tuesday to be a "team player" if confirmed to the closely divided court, declaring that he will be a "pro-law judge" who won't decide cases based on his personal views. With Republicans hoping to move the Supreme Court to the right for years to come, President Donald Trump's nominee, who has a solidly conservative record, declared he would be even-handed in his approach to the law. "A good judge must be an umpire_a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy," Kavanaugh said in prepared opening remarks. "I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge.</description>

Bush turned over 42,000 pages of documents from the nominee's service in the Bush White House, angering Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer who issued what is certain to be a futile call to delay the proceedings. "Not a single senator will be able to review these records before tomorrow," Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted Monday evening. Taylor Foy, a spokesman for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, responded that "our review team will be able to complete its examination of this latest batch in short order, before tomorrow's hearing begins."
