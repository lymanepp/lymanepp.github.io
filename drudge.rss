      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/John-Bolton-s-bombshell-gives-the-GOP-a-glimpse-15007131.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We finally got a taste Sunday night of what former national security adviser John Bolton might tell President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial -- if he's called to testify, that is.  What we learned reinforced the potential peril for Republicans if they refuse to let him do so.  The New York Times reported Sunday that Bolton makes a series of very big Ukraine-related claims in an unpublished manuscript of his upcoming book, which is now slated to be released in March.  Chief among them:  - Bolton writes that he heard Trump say explicitly that the withholding of military aid would continue until Ukraine announced an investigation involving the Bidens - implicating Trump directly in a quid pro quo for the first time and contradicting the Trump team's defense.  - He writes that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said privately that there was nothing to the Trump team's claims that then-ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was corrupt - suggesting this was indeed a smear campaign and that Pompeo recognized it as such, even as he didn't defend Yovanovitch publicly.  - He writes that he raised concerns about Rudy Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine with Attorney General William Barr after Trump's July call with Ukraine's president - despite the Justice Department saying Barr learned about the call in mid-August.  - He writes that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was present for one of Trump's calls with Giuliani about Yovanovitch, even though Mulvaney has told associates that he stayed out of those conversations to protect Trump's and Giuliani's attorney-client privilege.  In other words: Bolton is naming names - lots of names - and directly contradicting what top administration officials are saying.  And Trump has made no secret that he's not particularly happy...</description>

      <title>After Trump's spiritual adviser calls for 'all satanic pregnancies to miscarry,' she says it was metaphor...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/After-Trump-s-spiritual-adviser-calls-for-all-15005707.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Florida pastor and longtime spiritual adviser to President Donald Trump says she was speaking in metaphor when she recently prayed in a sermon for all "satanic pregnancies" to end in miscarriage.  In video of the Jan. 5 sermon, posted by the liberal advocacy group Right Wing Watch, televangelist pastor Paula White breathlessly calls on Jesus Christ to "command all satanic pregnancies to miscarry right now."  "We declare that anything that's been conceived in satanic wombs, that it will miscarry, it will not be able to carry forth any plan of destruction, any plan of harm," White said before an auditorium of congregants.  As of Sunday morning, the clip, which was just under two minutes long, had been viewed more than 2.5 million times.  White's words are largely being interpreted literally - that she wishes for evil women to have miscarriages - but she shared a rare response to the criticism in which she explained that she was speaking in metaphor, praying for evil plans to be foiled in her congregants' lives.  "I don't normally respond but clearly this has been taken out of context," White tweeted Sunday. "I was praying (Ephesians) 6:12 that we wrestle not against flesh and blood. Anything that has been conceived by demonic plans, for it to be cancelled and not prevail in your life ..."  Ephesians 6:12, according to the King James Bible translation, reads: "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."  After watching the clip, André Gagné, a theological studies professor at Concordia University and expert on the Christian right, said White was probably speaking in metaphor when she called for the miscarriages. He pointed to a book by...</description>
