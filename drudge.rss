      <title>VIDEO: Meteorite hits Cuba; 'Large explosion'...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giant Meteor 2020 has launched an exploratory committee for president. Well, not quite. But a meteorite did apparently hit western Cuba on Friday afternoon, according to eyewitness reports. The event sounds like it was pretty dramatic: "We're receiving reports that a meteor was seen in the sky across the Florida Keys," NWS Key West tweeted, adding that the space rock "likely exploded over the province of Pinar del RÃ­o." CNN's Havana correspondent, Patrick Oppmann, described the sound of a "large explosion" in the town of ViÃ±ales and posted pictures of the fragments: Only in Cuba does an apparent meteorite crash and you happen to know the person whoâ€™s house was hit. pic.twitter.com/jYhAnBLUy0 â€” Patrick Oppmann CNN (@CNN_Oppmann) February 1, 2019 #BREAKING: Just got this video from a friend in #PinardelRio who says they think the trail in the sky was left by a #meteorite, which shattered windows and made extremely loud sounds. Sounded like two #explosions. #cuba @WPLGLocal10 pic.twitter.com/AMmb9ZE6vB â€” Hatzel Vela (@HatzelVelaWPLG) February 1, 2019 The good news: No injuries were reported.

The U.S. announced it would stop observing the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty as of Saturday and would withdraw within six months from the pact, a cornerstone of international security since 1987.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;JOHANNESBURG (AP) — The Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo, the second deadliest in history, marks six months on Friday and is moving toward the major border city of Goma, a development that would greatly complicate any hope of stopping the virus' spread in the unstable region. This may be the most challenging Ebola outbreak ever. Health workers face the threat of attack from rebel groups and resistance from frightened communities. A highly mobile population produced two scares in the past week alone: The discovery of an infected, wide-ranging young trader led to vaccinations in a new, third province near the South Sudan border. And two contacts of Ebola victims slipped away and were found in the capital of neighboring Uganda — free of the virus.</description>

Climbing over some of the world’s toughest terrain, Pakistan’s border fence will stretch more 1,800-miles and ascend more than 12,000-feet above sea level. It will march over mountains, span gorges, and descend into desert plains—halting, at last, on the Chinese border</description>

      <title>RAMS go for Hollywood sequel...</title>
      <link>https://www.apnews.com/f8fda4d4d2cd4c668feeb2197b0dfa86</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ATLANTA (AP) — Before there was Jared Goff, there was Warren Beatty. Years before Goff or any of today's Rams were born, Beatty had been carried off on his teammates' shoulders to celebrate a Rams title that only Hollywood could dream up. He played quarterback Joe Pendleton in the 1978 Academy Award nominated movie "Heaven Can Wait." At the end, he leads LA to an otherworldly Super Bowl victory over the Steelers. It all happened during a time when the real-life Rams, with Joe Namath, Rosey Grier and the rest of the Fearsome Foursome, embodied everything about Hollywood cool, even if the notion of them winning the Super Bowl felt like something that could only happen in the movies.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LAS VEGAS - This is the city where Americans go to have big fun doing things that seem absolutely terrible, and on a recent Saturday night, hundreds of them went to see Tiesto. These bacchanalians were no dopes. The best reason to go see Tiesto at one of his three current Las Vegas nightclub residencies is not because you want to hear the planet's second-highest paid DJ spin swollen, vanilla-sweet dance music, but because you seek the classic Las Vegas experience of low-stakes funtimes staged in an environment of expensive theatricality and unblinking grandeur. In this sense, Tiesto is the Wayne Newton of the 21st century. Everyone else is here to have a great night.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHICAGO (AP) — In Illinois, temperatures could rise by 80 degrees within days. In Michigan, melting snow and rain and a 17-mile ice jam could lead to flooding. Across the Midwest, the sudden warmth was sure to bring more broken roads and busted water mains. The polar vortex that brought many cities to a standstill was expected to end with a rapid thaw that experts say could be unprecedented. But the sudden swing from long johns to light jackets and short sleeves could create problems of its own.</description>
