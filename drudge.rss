      <title>Fate of Trump's economy hinging on Fed he distrusts...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Fate-of-Trump-s-economy-is-hinging-on-a-Fed-he-13953011.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHICAGO - President Donald Trump has pummeled the Federal Reserve with insults in recent months, calling it "crazy" and blaming it for any stock market dives or ugly economic data. But now the president has thrust the fate of the economy into the hands of the organization - and the man - he has suggested he doesn't trust.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have signaled this week that they may have to cut interest rates in coming months to keep the economic expansion going - and counter any economic harm from Trump's escalating trade war.  Such a move would be highly unusual. It would come at a time when the economy has been growing quickly, and inflation and unemployment are low. And it could serve almost as an insurance policy on the impact of actions taken by the president, potentially facilitating his use of tariffs in unpredictable ways.  "The Fed never had to rescue the economy from past presidents' trade wars, or from policies that presidents embarked upon against the wishes of advisers," said Gary Richardson, an economics professor at the University of California at Irvine who used to be the official Fed historian.  The Fed is likely to signal its next step at its policy meeting this month, and markets are forecasting at least three interest-rate cuts by the end of the year. Powell said this week at a Fed conference in Chicago that the Fed is prepared to take "appropriate" action to keep the economy from a downturn, and stocks surged as a result.  The Fed could cut rates as soon as this month, or at policy meetings in July, September, October and December. Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at the investment bank Natixis, pointed out in a research note Thursday that "the Fed has never disappointed the markets' call for action."  The new trajectory is a sharp U-turn from where the Fed had been heading and...</description>
