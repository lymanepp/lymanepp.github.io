      <title>'SHAKY', 'WEAK': LINCOLN PROJECT questions Trump's health in new ad...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/920460/new-lincoln-project-ad-controversially-questions-trumps-health</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lincoln Project released its latest ad against President Trump on Tuesday, a 45 second spot focusing on his health that begins with a woman intoning, 'Something's wrong with Donald Trump.' The Lincoln Project is a political action committee formed by current and ex-Republicans who don't want to see Trump re-elected. Their previous ads have broached topics Trump is sensitive about, including the crowd size at his inauguration and how he 'dodged the draft' during the Vietnam War. This new ad delivers the deepest gut punch yet. Titled '#TrumpIsNotWell,' it features a montage of Trump seemingly struggling with drinking a glass of water and walking down a ramp, as well as footage of him going up the stairs to Air Force One with what appears to be toilet paper under his shoe. The narrator calls Trump 'shaky' and 'weak,' and says White House reporters should be covering Trump's 'secretive midnight run to Walter Reed Medical Center.' It's clear to everyone, the ad concludes, that now is the time 'we talk about this: Trump is not well.' Some people have argued that because Trump has mocked a disabled reporter and calls former Vice President Joe Biden 'Sleepy Joe,' frequently intimating he is cognitively impaired, Trump's own health is fair game and people should speculate away. Rebecca Cokley, director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the liberal Center for American Progress, disagrees. In an op-ed for The Washington Post published Tuesday, Cokley wrote that when people who do not have medical degrees diagnose Trump with various health issues, it hurts those who are actually disabled. 'Every single professional with a disability I know has been questioned privately and publicly about whether their 'condition' hinders their ability to do their job,' Cokley said. 'This is a universal truth and fear for any individual across physical, mental, intellectual, sensory, and chronic illness communities.' A person's ability to 'use a ramp or drink from a glass of water has no bearing on whether someone can fulfill the essential functions of a job,' she added, and instead, the focus should be on Trump's policies and actions while in office. 'The ableism that pervades society makes it easy to argue that someone is a failure because they're disabled, not because they're evil, unethical, and unqualified,' Cokley said.

      <title>Cambodia requiring all visitors to pay $3,000 deposit to cover possible costs...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/920508/cambodia-requiring-all-visitors-pay-3000-deposit-cover-possible-coronavirus-costs</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're thinking about traveling to Cambodia anytime soon, you should probably be aware of the country's recent announcement that all visitors â€” in light of the coronavirus pandemic â€” are required to pay a $3,000 deposit upon arrival at the airport. Cambodian officials have said the mandatory deposit is refundable after fees are deducted for COVID-19 tests or quarantine and medical costs. Every visitor will have to at least pay for transportation to a testing center, the test itself, a one-night stay in a hotel while waiting for a result, and three meals during the mini-quarantine, which comes out to a more manageable $165. But if one passenger on a plane tests positive, every other person on the aircraft must quarantine for 14 days and take a second test, bringing the total up to $1,276, and the number nearly triples, vaulting past the original deposit, for anyone who tests positive. Finally, should a visitor die from the coronavirus while in the country, $1,500 will reportedly be taken out of the deposit for cremation purposes. Cambodia has staved off the coronavirus quite successfully thanks to a quick response (although some measures have drawn criticism from human rights groups) â€” as of early June, there have officially been 126 cases since the pandemic began, and 124 recoveries. The perception of safety might tempt some people with the itch to travel to set their sights on the Southeast Asian nation, but the deposit seems likely to be an effective deterrent.

      <title>The ultimate covid-19 mystery: Why does it spare some and kill others? </title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/The-ultimate-covid-19-mystery-Why-does-it-spare-15345984.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The novel coronavirus can be a killer - or no big deal. It can put a person in the intensive care unit on a ventilator, isolated from family, facing a lonely death - or it can come and go without leaving a mark, a ghost pathogen, more rumor than reality.  Six months into a pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 people globally, scientists are still trying to understand the wildly variable nature of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.  Among their lines of inquiry: Are distinct strains of the coronavirus more dangerous? Does a patient's blood type affect the severity of the illness? Do other genetic factors play a role? Are some people partially protected from covid-19 because they've had recent exposure to other coronaviruses?  Much of the research remains provisional or ambiguous, and for now scientists can't do much better than say that covid-19 is more likely to be worse for older people - often described as over the age of 60 - and for those with chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, lung disease and heart disease.  That describes tens of millions of people in the United States alone. It also isn't much of an explanation: The link between chronic disease and the severity of covid-19 is more in the category of correlation than causation. The "why" of the matter remains unclear.  The issue of disease variability "is the most critical question about covid," said Edward Behrens, chief of the rheumatology division at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  "Why do some people get sick? Why do some people have no problem at all?" he said.  Social and demographic factors, including sex, race, ethnicity, income and access to quality health care, play major roles in how this pandemic affects people and who suffers the most. The ultimate goal of many...</description>
