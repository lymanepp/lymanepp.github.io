      <title>NO FILTER: Can Armie Hammer still get away with saying whatever wants?</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/As-Armie-Hammer-becomes-more-famous-can-he-still-13493376.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Armie Hammer is sitting in a hotel room, in the middle of telling a story, when his publicist coughs. Loudly. Hammer stops talking and turns to look at her. "What?" he asks, grinning innocently. "What?" He's not sharing a particularly controversial anecdote - it's one he told before on "Conan," about how he got so worn down during the 14-month press tour for "Call Me By Your Name" that he refused to wear anything but tracksuits. But the cough may be a signal for "Armie, please stop talking." Or "Armie, please don't say anything that will make my job harder." The need for a signal wouldn't be a surprise.</description>
