      <title>Trump faces growing crisis...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/898838/new-yorker-wordlessly-sums-trumps-coronavirus-problem</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years, experts have warned that President Trump 'has been squandering the credibility he could need in a moment of national emergency, like a terrorist attack or a public health crisis,' Annie Karni, Michael Crowley, and Maggie Haberman write at The New York Times. And if the COVID-19 outbreak proves to be that moment, 'his history of issuing false claims could make it harder to sell the public on any plans to address coronavirus.' Trump has already 'made inaccurate or questionable claims' about the new virus, the Times notes. 'Current Trump allies said the fact that the president chose to address the growing public health crisis quickly after returning from a trip to India showed how seriously he was taking the outbreak. But privately, they say he has been reluctant to give in to what he has called an 'alarmist' view of the virus's potential to cause damage as he warily watches the effect of the outbreak on the stock market.' The new cover of The New Yorker makes a similar point more succinctly, suggesting his self-restricted vision is hampering America's response: An early look at next weekâ€™s cover, â€œUnder Control,â€� by Brian Stauffer: https://t.co/jbWDbmDyRl pic.twitter.com/mBpv1VYMsX â€” The New Yorker (@NewYorker) February 27, 2020 For what it's worth, epidemiology experts say the best thing for Americans to do right now is stay calm and not panic about the coronavirus, The Washington Post reports, as well as wash your hands regularly, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and stay home if you're feeling sick. But 'those surgical masks? If you're not sick, you don't need to wear them,' the Post adds. 'The main point of the mask is to keep someone who is infected with the virus from spreading it to others,' says Timothy Brewer, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health. You can relate that to the New Yorker cover at your leisure. Peter Weber</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RICHMOND, Va. - The thousands of people who showed up to a rally for Sen. Bernie Sanders five days before the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries did not come to size up the presidential candidate.  They were all in for Sanders, I-Vt., who was trounced in Virginia by Hillary Clinton four years ago, but who was tied for the lead with former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg in the most recent poll for this year's contest.  "I think that this candidate represents the best chance for substantive change that I've seen in my lifetime," said Kristin Reed, 41, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor. "This is really not just an election. This is a movement."  Also in the crowd was Zhue Azuaje, 27, who works for the American Civil Liberties Union in Richmond. "As a queer, Hispanic, immigrant woman, his campaign has really spoken to me," she said. "He has such a strong, diverse base."  Sanders began his remarks by apologizing to those who had to be turned aside from the huge gymnasium in the Arthur Ashe Junior Athletic Center. Campaign officials said the fire marshal estimated that 4,700 people attended the event.  "We will defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country," he said, calling President Donald Trump a "pathological liar" who is running a "corrupt administration," and is "moving this country into an autocratic-type society."  "Trump, you're not going to get away with it," Sanders said to enormous cheers. "We're going to defeat you."  As he has throughout his two presidential campaigns, Sanders promised sweeping changes on many fronts, including education, immigration and criminal justice. On the last of those alone, he said he would end mass incarceration, private prisons and the "destructive war on drugs." He said on his first day in office, he would sign an executive order to legalize...</description>
