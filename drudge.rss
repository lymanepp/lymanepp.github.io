      <title>Could worsen next downturn...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/As-it-faces-pressure-from-Trump-and-investors-14192385.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Federal Reserve this week is all but certain to cut interest rates despite unemployment being at historic lows, a highly unusual action that is shaping up to be the biggest gamble of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's brief tenure as leader of the world's most powerful economic institution.  Many economists say the Fed is acting prudently to prolong the economic expansion, which this month became the longest in U.S. history. Yet the support is far from unanimous.  Some economists, Fed officials and people on Main Street say the Fed's action will benefit the stock market more than the real economy. And they argue cutting rates would introduce risks that could worsen the next downturn.  Typically, when the Fed slashes interest rates, borrowing costs drop for mortgages, business loans, auto loans, and credit cards, leading to more homes being sold, more businesses investing, and more economic activity overall.  But loans are already cheap and few industries are asking for lower rates, suggesting that other factors outside the Fed's control - a labor shortage, trade wars, a lack of housing supply - are capping the economy's potential.  "A Fed rate cut will have zero impact on the housing market," said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at Lending Tree. "Mortgage rates are already at three-year lows."  Washington-real estate agent Kara Sheehan agrees. She hears a long list of concerns from prospective home buyers these days - urban homes with a parking spot or garage, a good price, and homes that don't need to be renovated. But she hears little about mortgage rates.  "Buyers are a little more hesitant lately and very price conscious. They are all about property condition," said Sheehan, of Washington Fine Properties.  The Fed's actions this week, and the stage they set for...</description>
