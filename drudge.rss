      <title>SHOWDOWN:  U.S. Marshals to help protect monuments nationwide... Developing...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/U-S-Marshals-told-to-prepare-to-help-protect-15364721.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - U.S. Marshals have been told they should prepare to help protect national monuments across the country, according to an email directive viewed by The Washington Post, as President Donald Trump has vowed stern punishment for those who vandalize or destroy such structures as part of police violence protests.  In an email, Marshals Assistant Director Andrew Smith wrote that the service "has been asked to immediately prepare to provide federal law enforcement support to protect national monuments (throughout the country)."  "This is a challenging assignment due to the breadth of possible targets for criminal activity," Smith wrote. He said the Marshals Incident Management Team would start a Joint Operations Center in Springfield, Va., to coordinate, and every deputy in the Special Operations Group would be made available to help as soon as Thursday. He also asked other districts and divisions to identify people they might be able to lend to the effort until July 8.  On Monday, protesters attempted to topple a statue of President Andrew Jackson in a park next to the White House, though police in riot gear intervened and stopped them. That night, Trump tweeted his dismay, and the next morning he wrote that he had "authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison, per the Veteran's Memorial Preservation Act, or such other laws that may be pertinent....."  Earlier Wednesday, defense officials said that the Army activated about 400 unarmed members of the District of Columbia National Guard to "prevent any defacing or destruction" of monuments.  Jackson, a former general in the U.S. Army, was known for his harsh treatment of Native Americans as president. He signed the Indian Removal Act, which...</description>

      <title>TRUMP:  KUNG FLU FIGHTING</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-elicits-backlash-over-racist-language-15364474.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's first public use of the phrase "kung flu" - during a campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., last weekend - drew broad political backlash as a racist slur against Asian Americans.  Within three days, however, it was also something else: a rallying cry for his supporters.  Trump's appearance before a crowd of several thousand enthusiastic young people at the Dream City Church in Phoenix on Tuesday showed how his casual use of a demeaning phrase - one that even some White House aides rejected three months ago - has swiftly morphed into a staple of his reelection message amid tumbling poll numbers.  The president hadn't even used the words in Phoenix before audience members, presumably primed from having heard his riff on the "many names" of the coronavirus at the Tulsa rally, beat him to the punchline and began shouting out "kung flu" - prompting Trump, with a grin, to repeat it.  "Kung flu - yeah," Trump said, eliciting cheers. "Kung flu."  The episode laid bare how, despite attempts from White House aides to justify Trump's rhetoric as a way to pin the blame for the coronavirus pandemic on China, where it originated, the president appears more interested in juicing his conservative base.  "The fact that he got the crowd so riled up was just chilling," said Chris Lu, a Chinese American who served as cabinet secretary in the Obama administration. "In that really primal desire to get a rise out of the crowd and get that affirmation he wants, he went to this place that has such bad consequences for Asian Americans broadly and for Asian American kids in particular. It's a joke to him but not to us."  Lu was among a number of prominent Asian Americans, including actor George Takei, former U.S. attorney Preet Bharara and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang,...</description>

      <title>SECRET SERVICE QUARANTINE AFTER RALLY</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Dozens-of-Secret-Service-officers-and-agents-told-15364507.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Dozens of Secret Service officers and agents who were on site for President Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Okla., last week were ordered to self-quarantine after two of their colleagues tested positive for the novel coronavirus, part of the fallout from Trump's insistence on holding the mass gathering over the objections of public health officials.  The Secret Service instructed employees who worked the Tulsa event to stay at home for 14 days when they returned from the weekend trip, according to two people familiar with the agency's decision.  The order came in the wake of the discovery - hours before the president's Saturday evening rally - that at least six advance staffers who helped organize the trip had tested positive for the virus, including two Secret Service employees. Another two advance staffers tested positive after Trump returned to Washington on Sunday.  On Tuesday, the Secret Service field office in Tulsa arranged for a special testing session at a hospital to determine if local agents had contracted the virus while assisting with the rally, according to two other people with knowledge of the testing. As part of the arrangement, doctors administered the test to both agents and some local officials in parked cars outside the hospital.  Among those who got tested was U.S. Attorney Trent Shores of the Northern District of Oklahoma, who had attended both pre-planning meetings with advance staff and the rally in case any legal issues arose, according to spokeswoman Lennea Montandon. Shores tested negative, she said.  It is still unknown how the rally may have impacted Tulsa's count of coronavirus cases, which are rising swiftly. Tulsa County hit a record Wednesday, with 259 new confirmed cases, part of "steep upward trends" seen across Oklahoma, said Bruce Dart, the director of Tulsa's health...</description>

      <title>Department of Justice broadens case against Julian Assange...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Department-of-Justice-broadens-case-against-15364689.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice outlined new evidence Wednesday to bolster its case against Julian Assange, in an updated indictment that accuses the WikiLeaks founder of soliciting hackers to break into the Icelandic government's computers to steal information that could be leaked to embarrass the government.  FBI agents and prosecutors in Manhattan were close to making a criminal hacking case against WikiLeaks based on these allegations in 2011, but were blocked by senior officials, who wanted to focus on an espionage case against Assange in Virginia, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about an investigation.  The Obama administration ultimately decided not to pursue the espionage case because of First Amendment concerns; it was revived under President Donald Trump, over the objections of some prosecutors involved.  The superseding indictment does not add to the 18 charges accusing Assange of working with former Army private Chelsea Manning in 2010 to steal classified documents from the U.S. government. The statute of limitations for the new allegations has expired. But the document adds evidence to the government's assertions that Assange is not a publisher or journalist but a hacker.  Assange is currently fighting extradition from the United Kingdom.  The new indictment in federal court in Alexandria, Va., alleges that Assange asked a teenager to illegally obtain recordings of phone conversations between politicians in a foreign country. The description matches that of Sigurdur Thordarson, an Icelandic hacker who was interviewed by prosecutors last year. Assange and Thordarson made a "joint attempt" to decrypt a file stolen from an Icelandic bank, according to the indictment.  Assange was evidently angry at...</description>

      <title>RECORD INFECTIONS</title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Coronavirus-deaths-lag-behind-surging-infections-15364490.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With novel coronavirus infections setting a single-day national record Wednesday, health experts are taking little solace from one of the few bright spots in the current resurgence: deaths are not rising in lockstep with caseloads.  But that may be just a matter of time.  "Deaths always lag considerably behind cases," Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease specialist, told Congress at a hearing Tuesday. In the weeks to come, he and others said, the death toll is likely to rise commensurately.  Which means Arizona, Texas and Florida, states that reopened early and now are experiencing runaway infection rates, are likely to be burying more dead in July.  "As long as there is a fair amount of testing going on, if there is an uptick in covid-19 infections, then we are likely to see that in the confirmed case data before we see it in the death data," said Nicholas Reich, associate professor of biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, in an email.  He predicted "rises in covid-19 deaths over the next month in many of the states that are seeing upticks in cases, like Texas, California, Florida and others, even though the deaths have been either steady or declining in recent weeks."  The virus has come surging back in recent days, with 38,115 U.S. infections Wednesday, more than any previous day in the pandemic, including the catastrophic days of April. This time, the increases are mainly in the South and West, while New York and New Jersey, which were nearly overwhelmed in the spring and have been slow to reopen, are seeing declining cases.  California, which shut down early and has taken a slow approach toward reopening, nevertheless reported more than 7,000 new cases Wednesday, easily surpassing its record of 5,019 set Tuesday. Oklahoma - where...</description>

      <title>IMF says economic collapse will be even worse than feared...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/IMF-says-global-economic-collapse-caused-by-15362593.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday painted a bleak portrait of the global economy, saying the coronavirus pandemic has caused more widespread damage than expected and will be followed by a sluggish recovery.  The global economy will shrink this year by 4.9%, worse than the 3% decline predicted in April, the IMF said.  No major economy is escaping the pandemic. The U.S. economy, the world's largest, is expected to shrink this year by 8%. Countries that use the single European currency are headed for a decline of more than 10% while Japanese output will fall by 5.8%, the IMF said.  The Chinese economy, suffering the twin ravages of the pandemic and the trade war with the U.S, is projected to eke out just a 1% gain -- its worst performance in several decades.  Current conditions are considerably more dire than the "unprecedented decline in global activity" that the fund projected two months ago. Since mid-April, economic data suggest "even deeper downturns than previously projected," the fund said.  Fund officials blamed the darker forecast on the effects of social distancing; scarring to global production capacity from the lockdown of activity; and the productivity cost of new safety and hygiene rules. Some economies also are still struggling to control the coronavirus, the fund added without naming specific governments.  The forecast assumes countries will not reimpose comprehensive lockdowns even if the pandemic flares up again.  Government crisis-fighting efforts -- including $11 trillion in spending and tax cuts -- have kept the economic collapse from worsening, the fund said.  The fund's forecast is more downbeat than some major investment firms. Goldman Sachs, for example, earlier this month raised its U.S. forecast to -4.2% from -5.2%.  The fund's forecast also...</description>
