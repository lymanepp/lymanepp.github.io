      <description>&lt;b&gt;news.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LONDON (Reuters) -The Kremlin on Tuesday dismissed as "hooliganism" an act of dissent by a woman who interrupted a live news bulletin on Russia's state television to denounce the war in Ukraine. The protester held up a sign behind a studio presenter reading the news on Channel One on Monday night and shouted slogans condemning Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. "As far as this woman is concerned, this is hooliganism," said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who went on to laud the state channel as a pillar of objective and timely news.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;New economic projections from the Federal Reserve this week will show how far and how fast policymakers see interest rates rising this year, in a first test of the impact of the Ukraine war and surging inflation on the coming shift in U.S. monetary policy. The Fed's policy-setting committee is expected to raise borrowing costs by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, a session that will set the tone for the central bank's reaction to a war-driven energy shock that is colliding with an end-of-pandemic economic reopening and strong consumer demand. The latest quarterly economic projections, due to be issued along with a policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, will show what officials anticipate in terms of key indicators, including GDP growth, inflation and unemployment.</description>
