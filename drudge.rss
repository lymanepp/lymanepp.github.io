      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conservative columnist Ann Coulter said she could support Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for president if he returned to this old stance on immigration. In an interview with PBS 'Firing Line' host Margaret Hoover, Coulter said she doesn't care about "the rest of the socialist stuff" if Sanders went back to his original "pro-blue-collar position." MARGARET HOOVER, 'FIRING LINE' HOST: What do you think about Bernie Sanders? If Bernie Sanders is for getting rid of low-skilled workers to ensure higher wages for [Americans]. ANN COULTER: And protecting the border. If he went back to his original position, which is the pro-blue-collar position, I mean, it totally makes sense with him. If he went back to that position, I'd vote for him. I might work for him. I don't care about the rest of the socialist stuff, just can we do something for ordinary Americans?</description>

      <title>Allies, foes united in skepticism on redactions...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/US-allies-foes-may-have-different-takes-on-13777089.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BERLIN - Like much of the United States, governments abroad will watch closely Thursday as special counsel Robert Mueller's report is released in a redacted version. U.S. allies and foes may have very different hopes for that report, which is also expected to shed more light on the extent to which Russia was able to disrupt the 2016 U.S. elections.  But even though their interests in the Mueller report may be different, they will be united on at least one aspect: skepticism of the redactions by Attorney General William Barr.  The attorney general has said he plans to restrict only lightly access to information that would violate privacy rights, affect ongoing inquiries, provide insights into sensitive intelligence details or include grand jury material. Key members of Congress are expected to have access to a more complete version of the report.  And yet, the one thing that is almost certain is that there will be a battle over the things that won't be included. Democrats are likely to argue that Barr may have deliberately left out crucial details that would cast President Donald Trump in a negative light. Republicans will side with Barr, arguing that redactions are standard practice and necessary to protect other investigations and the integrity of the process.  But watching from afar, many Europeans are likely to share the Democrats' concerns: Often, in the past, their own concerns over redactions have proved to be justified.  That is especially true for countries where memories of the abuse of such techniques are still vivid. In what was once East Germany, authorities regularly opened letters sent to or from democratic West Germany and redacted passages deemed a threat to socialism, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. What became known as the "postal war" has deeply ingrained an inherent skepticism of redactions...</description>
