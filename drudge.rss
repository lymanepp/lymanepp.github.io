      <title>Bolsonaro wants Brazil to be tourism Eden, but he can't stop insulting everyone...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Bolsonaro-wants-Brazil-to-be-a-tourism-Eden-but-14944864.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SALVADOR, Brazil - Clovis Dias de Oliveira sat behind the counter of his empty store filled with touristy knickknacks, looking at his phone, scrolling through Facebook, shaking his head. More bad news. A pair of gangs had recently battled it out. A man had been shot. Arrests had been made. This latest violence had erupted not in some faraway slum, but right here, in the heart of this historic town's famed colonial district. Officials have been saying Salvador, with its gorgeous beaches, colonial architecture and a unique Africa-influenced culture, could help solve one of Brazil's most enduring riddles: how to attract tourists. But Oliveira, 36, wasn't so sure. "Even I don't feel safe here," he said, exasperated. "I've seen tourists, lots of them, robbed here. And they come, and then they never come back." Latin America's largest country has come to a critical point in its long-troubled relationship with tourism. While many of the world's most attractive destinations are experiencing a boom, and other Latin American countries such as Mexico and the Dominican Republic are cashing in, Brazil brought in only 6.6 million foreign visitors in 2018 - fewer than theocratic Iran, fewer than conflict-torn Ukraine, fewer, even, than just the Louvre Museum in Paris. But the tally was higher - ever so slightly - than the year before. Now the government is looking to build on it and fulfill the tourism potential of a country that boasts thousands of miles of coastline, the Amazon rainforest, mountain ranges, and a famously warm and welcoming people. By 2022, officials pledged this year, they'll double the number of foreign visitors. Doing so would also double the number of foreign dollars coming into a country badly in need of them. Hobbled by high unemployment and economic stagnation, Brazil took in only around $6 billion from...</description>
