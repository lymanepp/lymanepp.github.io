      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A trio of Australian police officers visited a man claiming they are doing "welfare checks" to ask residents if they plan on participating in the ongoing protests against COVID-19 mitigation efforts. The man in this video was asked if he has plans or if he knows anyone who has plans to protest and if he has participated in protests in the past. "I'd like to know how you got this address, actually," the man told the police. "Anything else you might want to tell us to help ensure the public safety?" an officer asked after a barrage of questions about his "plans." "No, as long as you aren't going around shooting people with rubber bullets like in Victoria," the man said.

Say you open the app Subway Surfers, listed as one of the App Store's "must-play" games. It asks if you're OK with the app "tracking" you, a question iPhones started displaying in April as part of a privacy crackdown by Apple. Saying no is supposed to stop apps such as Subway Surfers and Facebook from learning about what you do in other apps and websites.Subscribe to</description>
