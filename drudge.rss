      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mediaite.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;First Lady Melania Trump just announced via Twitter that Stephanie Grisham, who has served as the First Lady's press secretary, will be replacing outgoing Sarah Huckabee Sanders as White House press secretary. Grisham has long been rumored as the presumptive favorite to take the Press Room podium and will become the third press secretary to serve President Donald Trump, following Sean Spicer then Sanders. For the second time, the Trump administration is combining the Press Secretary role and Communications Director role as Grisham will be filling both Sanders' and Bill Shine's former position all at once. Melania Trump tweeted: I am pleased to announce @StephGrisham45 will be the next @PressSec &amp; Comms Director! She has been with us since 2015 - @potus &amp; I can think of no better person to serve the Administration &amp; our country. Excited to have Stephanie working for both sides of the @WhiteHouse. #BeBest — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) June 25, 2019 The announcement of such a</description>

      <title>Demanded caprese salad, topped off with raspberry sorbet with biscotti...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/849066/joe-biden-contractually-obligated-receive-angel-hair-pomodoro-every-paid-speech</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden is a candidate of habit. When Biden was in the Senate, he was often its poorest member â€” a designation he's proudly touted even on the 2020 campaign trail. Yet Biden turned his finances around after his time as vice president, and seemingly hasn't figured out a creative way to use his fortune. Since leaving office, the 2020 frontrunner has pulled in "millions of dollars largely from book deals and speaking fees that ranged to as much as $200,000 per speech," The Washington Post reports via public documents. And at every one of those events, Biden has maintained one very major demand: Pasta. Contracts required that his speech hosts serve him "angel hair pomodoro, a caprese salad, topped off with raspberry sorbet with biscotti," the Post reports. He'd wash it down with "Coke Zero, Regular Coke, Orange Gatorade and black coffee," all of which had to be in his dressing room, the Post continues. It's in Biden's paid speaking contracts that his hosts must serve him Italian meals and stock his dressing room precisely. https://t.co/C2pDFQUdn2 pic.twitter.com/UjeoMdDZFd â€” Sarah Westwood (@sarahcwestwood) June 25, 2019 Those requests only applied to Biden's paid speaking gigs, but his 2020 campaign stops have so far come with similar perks. Sponsors have so far picked up the tab for "VIP hotel suites, town cars and professional drivers, chartered flights and travel expense reimbursements," the Post reports. Biden's campaign declined to comment to the Post on this story, or on why he's replaced his signature ice cream with a much more lavish dessert. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>Colorado's snowpack 40 times normal after rare summer solstice dump...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Colorado-s-snowpack-is-40-times-normal-after-rare-14036967.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On summer's opening day, up to 20 inches of snow buried the high terrain of the Colorado Rockies, boosting the state's snowpack to extraordinary levels for the time of year.  The solstice flakes marked a continuation of a snowy stretch that began in January and February and lingered through spring. Even before the solstice snow, The Denver Post wrote, the state's snowpack was "in virtually every numerical sense . . . off the charts." At the time, the snowpack was 751 percent above normal.  Due to the new snow Friday into the weekend, the Natural Resources Conservation Service reported that the state's snowpack ballooned to 4,121 percent above normal as of Monday. This number is so high because ordinarily very little snow is left by late June, and cold temperatures late into the spring helped preserve what fell earlier.  After the weekend blanket of white, the scenes in the high country west of Denver resembled midwinter. Enough snow fell to close roads, while many ski areas reported accumulation, including Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek, Arapahoe Basin and Steamboat Springs.  At Steamboat, snow stakes showed up to around 20 inches Saturday. CNN wrote that the last time this area witnessed snow this late in the season was June 17, 1928. It averages just 0.1 inches in June and normally sees its last day of snow around May 6.  At Arapahoe Basin, so much snow has fallen since the winter that it has stayed opened for skiing on weekends through the month. It declared Saturday a powder day after a fresh coating of two inches. The resort plans to open again next weekend and possibly over the July 4 weekend, its blog says.  The snow was triggered by an unusually cold pool of air at high altitudes over the western United States combined with a vigorous weather disturbance that...</description>

      <title>Bernie faces new kind of threat in Elizabeth Warren... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Bernie-Sanders-faces-a-new-kind-of-threat-in-14039192.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Bernie Sanders campaign, facing a new challenge in the rise of Elizabeth Warren, has settled for now on a careful if sometimes awkward strategy: emphasizing Sanders's unique position in the liberal movement, while avoiding direct attacks on Warren and rolling out plans that overlap with her attention-grabbing ideas.  That approach was on display Monday as Sanders introduced a proposal to cancel all student debt across the country. His plan came less than two weeks after Warren announced her own idea for scrapping student debt, one that would cover fewer people than Sanders's would. "Under the proposal we introduced today, all student debt would be canceled in six months," Sanders said.  But doubling down on his ideological purity and socialist credentials carries risks for the senator from Vermont, other Democrats say. It's enabled Warren to position herself as impassioned but reasonable, while Sanders holds down the leftward flank of the Democratic Party and serves as the ideological outlier in the race.  "They both have a crusader mentality around correcting what is wrong," said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who knows both and has not yet endorsed in the contest. "They understand they are speaking to a similar vision of the country, and obviously they are trying to distinguish themselves from each other."  For Sanders, the threat from Warren, D-Mass., is different from any he's faced during his long political career, including in his 2016 presidential run, since Warren in many ways embraces the same brand of fiery liberalism.  Among some Sanders allies, there is private frustration that Warren is getting credit for ideas that they believe originated with him. And that frustration is starting to show.  Last Friday, Warren released a plan to end private prisons. That same day, Sanders adviser Josh Orton...</description>
