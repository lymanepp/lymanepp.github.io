      <title>WHITE HOUSE:  WHATEVER...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/White-House-Trump-s-campaign-dismiss-recording-15508761.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The White House and the Trump campaign on Sunday dismissed secretly recorded audio in which Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry said the president has "no principles" and "you can't trust him."  Mary Trump, the president's niece, surreptitiously taped the 15 hours of face-to-face conversations with Barry in 2018 and 2019. She provided The Washington Post with previously unreleased transcripts and audio excerpts.  In an interview Sunday on ABC News's "This Week," White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Trump "has been public with his response - you know, just another day and another attack that we continue to see."  "I can tell you that I've never met the judge," Meadows said of Maryanne Trump, who retired last year from her job as a federal judge. "I was at the funeral the other day. I was hoping to meet her there. She didn't show up for her brother's funeral."  The president's brother Robert died Aug. 15 at age 71. A private memorial service was held at the White House on Friday.  In one of the secretly recorded conversations, Barry, 83, appeared aghast at how her 74-year-old brother operated as president. "His goddamned tweet and lying, oh my God," she said. "I'm talking too freely, but you know. The change of stories. The lack of preparation. The lying. Holy s---."  Meadows pushed back against that criticism Sunday while criticizing Mary Trump, who he said was "written out of a will" and "has an ax to grind because she wants Joe Biden to be president."  "The president that I have the privilege of serving is not the one that's being described on a 15-hour . . . secret tape," Meadows said. "I mean, what family member tapes another family member for 15 hours secretly?"  In 1999, when family patriarch Fred Trump Sr. died, Barry joined with Donald and Robert...</description>

      <title>TRUMP: 'DEEP STATE' DELAYING VAX</title>
      <link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/trump-pushes-covid-19-treatments-175709089.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pushing for breakthroughs in treatments for the coronavirus, White House officials suggested Sunday there were politically motivated delays by the Food and Drug Administration in approving a vaccine and therapeutics for the disease. The accusations, the latest assault from President Donald Trump’s team on the so-called “deep state” bureaucracy, were presented without evidence and just hours before Trump was set to hold a news conference to announce an apparent advancement in therapeutics. “This president is about cutting red tape,” said White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;maa.theedgemarkets.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (Aug 23): As Donald Trump gears up for this week’s Republican convention, one thing is clear: recorded speeches, empty halls and parking-lot fireworks won’t cut it.“I think it’s pretty boring when you do tapes,” Trump said of his convention speech during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. “I’m going to go live.”Trump is looking to outdo the Democrats’ mostly virtual convention with live speeches and at least a small group of supporters to energize speakers.

      <title>Senator to supporters: How about skipping a meal to donate?</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/McSally-to-supporters-How-about-skipping-a-meal-15507664.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHOENIX (AP) - Sen. Martha McSally has suggested that supporters could "fast a meal" to donate to the Arizona Republican's campaign as she fights to fend off a tough challenge from Democrat Mark Kelly.  McSally made the request at a recent event in northern Arizona where she said her campaign needs financial help to counter advertising by Kelly and groups supporting the former astronaut's campaign, azfamily.com reported.  "We're doing our part to catch up, you know, to get our message out," McSally said. "But it takes resources. So, anybody can give, I'm not ashamed to ask, to invest. If you can give a dollar, five dollars, if you can fast a meal and give what that would be."  The remark drew critical attention on social media, while McSally's campaign said the candidate was just joking about skipping a meal.  "This is a dumb, non-story about a candidate," Caroline Anderegg, a McSally campaign spokeswoman, told the Arizona Republic. "It is frankly sad and disgusting that the Dems and the Kelly campaign are launching a misleading character assassination on Martha McSally, who would literally give the shirt off her back for anyone."  Republican businesswoman Christine Jones, who ran for Arizona governor in 2014 and Congress in 2016, called McSally's fundraising pitch "unconventional."  "I haven't talked to (McSally) about it, so I can't really opine on the specifics. But it does feel like its a little bit of an act of desperation," Jones said.  McSally trails Kelly in recent polls by anywhere from 5 to 11 percentage points, according to realclearpolitics.com.</description>
