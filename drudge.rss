      <title>THE CONWAY SHOW HOLIDAY SPECIAL: George savages 'IMPOTUS'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/885524/george-conway-savage-new-nickname-postimpeachment-trump</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump spent a good deal of Thursday angrily tweeting about being impeached by the House and â€” in a move that appears to have him especially enraged â€” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to sit on the articles of impeachment for a bit before sending them to the Senate. Trump is 'mad as hell' and 'demanding his day in court,' Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) reported Thursday evening. Trump has no control over Pelosi's decision. So what do you call a person who holds the most powerful office in the world, stewing over his inability to influence a coequal branch of government that just accused him of high crimes and misdemeanors? George Conway has an idea. IMPOTUS (IMpeached President Of The United States) @realDonaldTrump is accusing @SpeakerPelosi of political malpractice. I donâ€™t think so. #IMPOTUS https://t.co/a4WoLJgaqr â€” George Conway (@gtconway3d) December 20, 2019 Trump is a nickname aficionado, but he probably won't appreciate IMPOTUS, especially coming from a conservative critic who happens to be married to one of his senior advisers. Impotent has two interlinked meanings: The inability to take effective action, or powerlessness; and a quasi-medical condition that requires drugs like Cialis and Viagra. Let's assume Conway is referring to the former. Peter Weber</description>
