      <title>Biden and Trump battle for women who sided with president last time -- and now regret it... </title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Biden-and-Trump-battle-for-women-who-sided-with-15562688.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;From her home in the Philadelphia suburbs, Nin Bell works for an answering service, taking calls from people trying to reach more than 10,000 funeral homes and end-of-life companies. As the coronavirus began to sweep the country earlier this year, the number of calls related to new deaths tripled.  Caller after caller told her about losing a loved one to covid-19, as well as to suicides and drug overdoses. They provided an overwhelmingly painful window into just how badly the country was suffering.  And then Bell would hear President Donald Trump - whom she voted for in 2016, helping him win Pennsylvania - downplay the severity of the pandemic.  "He was telling everybody it wasn't a big deal - but I knew it was a big deal because of my job. I'm like: 'Why am I taking 60 coronavirus deaths in one day, on one shift, when I used to only take 20 death calls a day?'" said Bell, 47, the mother of two teenage boys who lives in Parkside, about 20 miles southwest of Philadelphia."He made a lot of mistakes. He just runs his mouth. . . . He's the president, he can't get away with that, especially when people's lives are in danger."  Bell "definitely, 100 percent" plans to vote for Joe Biden for president - and she has been urging others to do the same.  She's part of a group of White women, especially those who are middle- or working-class, who didn't vote for Hillary Clinton in the last election but are determined to vote for Biden this year.  Those women, who have been targeted by both campaigns, loom large in a presidential race that could, like 2016's, be decided by shifts among a few sets of voters in the highly polarized nation.  Although Clinton won the majority of votes from women in 2016, she lost to Trump among White women. Since then, however, polls have shown Trump...</description>
