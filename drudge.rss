      <title>One continent remains untouched by the coronavirus: Antarctica...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/One-continent-remains-untouched-by-the-15152948.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One continent has not yet confirmed a case of the novel coronavirus. It's a place of barren ice, where the all-consuming cold and darkness of winter is fast approaching.  Over the past few months, some 4,000 people from around the world have watched from Antarctica as the coronavirus pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China, swept around the globe, reaching all but its southernmost reaches.  "You'd better stay there, you're safer there," Alberto Della Rovere, leader of the 35th Italian expedition to Antarctica, said his colleagues at home told him via WhatsApp.  For now, they appear to be right. Even in normal times, only a limited number of people are allowed in and out of Antarctica, with medical workers screening for signs of influenza and other illnesses before arrival.  "Right now, this, Antarctica, is the safest place in the world," Della Rovere said. "There are no outside contacts and we're far away from any settlement."  On social media, residents of various Antarctic stations have acknowledged their strange status. "I think it is safe to say that McMurdo Station, Antarctica, had the largest St. Patrick's Party in the world in 2020," wrote one person stationed there.  A U.S. contractor at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station posted a photograph of boxes and boxes of toilet paper. "Don't worry about us," he wrote.  People stationed in Antarctica might be unlikely to catch the virus, but they would be at great risk if they did. While most bases would be able to handle a single case of a serious respiratory infection, they would struggle to contain one that spreads as rapidly as the coronavirus. And there's no way to guarantee that it won't eventually spread to ends of the Earth.  "No continent is immune, including Antarctica," said Jeff Ayton, chief medical officer at the...</description>

      <title>FAUCI AND TRUMP CLASH</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/opinion/article/I-know-but-what-do-you-want-me-to-do-Fauci-s-15150393.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Anthony Fauci's interview with Science magazine began on an inauspicious note. Asked how he's doing right now, Fauci said he was "exhausted" but "good."  "I mean, I'm not, to my knowledge, coronavirus-infected," he said, before adding with a laugh: "To my knowledge, I haven't been fired."  The half-joke was a sign of things to come. What followed were several exchanges that should help people take stock of President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus. Repeatedly, Fauci tacitly and even openly admitted that comments made by the commander in chief are not true and are not in line with what the nation's leading infectious disease expert is advising.  In short, it's precisely what the critical coverage of Trump has been saying for weeks, but that Trump's many and ardent defenders have applied blinders on themselves to ignore.  The interviewer, Jon Cohen, asked whether Fauci would acknowledge that Trump says things he disagrees with, and Fauci seemed to grant the premise - albeit diplomatically. Fauci maintained that, "I don't disagree on the substance" - with "on the substance" being the key phrase - but then added: "It is expressed in a way that I would not express it, because it could lead to some misunderstanding about what the facts are about a given subject."  If we're going to distill that down, he's essentially saying the president is confusing people - at the bare minimum. The exchange highlights the mixed messages the country has been getting in recent days, in particular, about the promise of certain drugs to treat coronavirus. While Fauci has warned that evidence of the drugs' effectiveness is "anecdotal" and that there is no "magic drug" to treat coronavirus, Trump said Friday that he "disagreed" with Fauci, at least in part, and has repeatedly hailed a malaria drug in particular as a possible...</description>
