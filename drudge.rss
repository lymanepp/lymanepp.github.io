      <title>Frustrated by unpopularity with Jews, thrusts Israel into culture war...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Frustrated-by-unpopularity-with-Jews-Trump-14369952.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump decided long ago that it would be smart politics for him to yoke his administration to Israel and to try to brand the Democratic Party as anti-Semitic.  He set about executing a pro-Israel checklist: Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing the Golan Heights as part of sovereign Israel and taking a hard line against Iran. And he promoted himself as the greatest president ever - a deity even - for Jewish people.  Yet Trump has become flummoxed that Jewish Americans are not in turn lining up to support his reelection, according to people familiar with his thinking, and he has lashed out in predictable fashion.  "If you vote for a Democrat, you're very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people," Trump said Wednesday on the South Lawn of the White House. He was amplifying a statement he made in the Oval Office a day earlier: "I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty."  Trump's use of the word "disloyalty" drew immediate criticism from Jewish groups, whose leaders said it echoed anti-Semitic tropes about where American Jews' loyalty lies. The president insisted his comments were not anti-Semitic.  Regardless, this turn in the president's rhetoric about Jews magnifies his transactional approach to politics and his miscalculation that his support for Israel should automatically translate into electoral support from Jewish Americans.  It also reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the motivations of many Jews, who are not a monolithic voting bloc and but rather prioritize a wide range of issues - not only Israel, but also education, the economy and the environment, as well as civility and morality.  "He is reflecting a concept of Jewish Americans...</description>

      <title>Soccer star drilled 55-yard field goal. Hall of Famer says she should get NFL tryout...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Carli-Lloyd-drilled-a-55-yard-field-goal-A-Hall-14368449.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as Carli Lloyd was concerned, she was on just another field, doing what she does best.  The difference Tuesday was that she was on an NFL field when she pulled back her right leg and sent a ball straight and true for 55 yards, stirring up all sorts of buzz with a viral video. Lloyd, a two-time World Cup winner, twice an Olympic gold medalist and twice FIFA Player of the Year, made football look as easy as futbol as Sam Koch of the Baltimore Ravens held for her field goal attempt after a joint practice with the Philadelphia Eagles at the NovaCare Complex in Philadelphia.  Her kick was money. So much so that it got one veteran NFL observer musing about whether the time was approaching when a woman might kick for an NFL team. "Honestly, I don't think it will be long before we see a woman break through this NFL barrier," Gil Brandt, the Dallas Cowboys' vice president of player personnel from 1960 to 1988, tweeted.  Note that Lloyd, the 37-year-old who plays for the NWSL's Sky Blue franchise in New Jersey, wasn't facing pressure and she was taking too many approach steps. All of which was pointed out to Brandt, who countered, "I heard the same kind of things when I was bringing in track athletes and soccer players back in the '60s."  Brandt wasn't kidding and he offered a reminder of just how problematic kicking was in the NFL last season. Mason Crosby of the Green Bay Packers missed five field goal attempts in one game; Week 11 was a record-setting day for missed extra-point attempts. And perhaps no team had a more ignominious experience than the Chicago Bears, whose "double-doink" disaster occurred when Cody Parkey's potential game-winner from 43 yards out was tipped at the line, then hit the left upright and the crossbar. The Bears lost that wild-card game 16-15 to the Eagles.  The team released Parkey in the...</description>
