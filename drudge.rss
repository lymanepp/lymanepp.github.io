      <title>Rival politicians accused each other of using drugs. Result was showdown at urinalysis lab...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Rival-politicians-accused-each-other-of-using-13787781.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been described as a "political pissing contest" - literally.  Two feuding politicians in Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city, spent much of the past week accusing each other of being on mind-altering substances after getting into an ugly fight in the comments section of a local political blog.  Naturally, they could settle their dispute only one way: by challenging each other to a public drug test.  Calling it a "modern twist on the classic political duel," the Connecticut Post reported on Monday that Bridgeport City Councilman Ernest Newton and Board of Education member Maria Pereira had both handed over plastic cups of urine and passed their respective tests.  As it turns out, they're not the first ones to go through the humiliating ritual. Both front-runners in Ukraine's presidential election submitted to live-streamed drug tests earlier this month, and the state of Georgia once made screenings mandatory for candidates running for state office. Some elected officials apparently think the practice should be even more widespread: In September, one Republican lawmaker introduced a proposal to randomly drug test all members of Congress.  In Bridgeport, the showdown took place voluntarily after Newton and Pereira, both Democrats, began sniping at each other over a news item about budget figures that had been posted to Only In Bridgeport, a widely read site dedicated to discussing the city's often-colorful politics.  "Please remember to take your meds," Newton, the city councilman, wrote to Pereira on April 13.  Pereira, the school board member, hit back. "Ernie, I promise I will continue to take any and all prescribed medicine," she replied. "In turn, please ensure you take anything you need that may have to be swallowed, snorted, inhaled, or injected."  The remark had...</description>

      <title>New USA 'project sovereignty' Arctic strategy as China, Russia look north...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/New-Coast-Guard-strategy-for-Arctic-highlights-13785357.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Coast Guard's new strategy for the Arctic calls for upgrading ships, aircraft and unmanned systems there, an effort to make sure the United States is "projecting sovereignty" into an increasingly contested region, the service's top officer said.  Adm. Karl Schultz, the commandant of the Coast Guard, said in an interview that the shift is a "little bit different," although existing Arctic efforts will continue.  "Before, it was a peaceful, safe, secure Arctic collaboration," he said. "None of that goes away. We want the Arctic to be a peaceful place where we work to cross international lines here with partner nations that share interests in a transparent fashion. But I think if you're looking around at what's going on in the Arctic, I would say it's maybe trending in a slightly different direction. This will pivot with a little more focus on projecting."  The 48-page document is being released amid concerns in Washington about actions by both China and Russia in the Arctic. It comes as the Defense Department, at the direction of Congress, prepares its own new Arctic strategy that is due to be provided to lawmakers in June.  China, despite its geography, has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," has begun building icebreaker ships and has said it wants to build a "Polar Silk Road" in which goods can be delivered from China to Europe through the Arctic Ocean as ice in waterways diminish.  Russia also has increasingly focused on the Arctic, expanding its fleet of icebreakers to more than 40, reopening Cold War-era military bases above the Arctic Circle and making plans to deploy antiaircraft missiles on some of them.  The Coast Guard, as part of the Department of Homeland Security, is unlikely to have the primary role if open conflict ever broke out in the Arctic. But the service highlights in its new strategy a...</description>
