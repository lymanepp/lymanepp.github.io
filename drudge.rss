      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-US-put-nuclear-waste-under-a-dome-on-a-13858749.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 6:45 a.m. on March 1, 1954, the blue sky stretching over the south Pacific Ocean was split open by an enormous red flash.  Within seconds, a mushroom cloud towered 4 1/2 miles high over Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The explosion, the U.S. government's first weaponized hydrogen bomb, was 1,000 times more powerful than the "Little Boy" atomic bomb blast that flattened Hiroshima - and a complete miscalculation.  Scientists had underestimated the size of what became known as the "Castle Bravo" test, resulting in an explosion that was two-and-a-half times larger than expected. Radioactive ash dropped more than 7,000 square miles from the bomb site, caking the nearby inhabited islands.  "Within hours, the atoll was covered with a fine, white, powder-like substance," the Marshall Islands health minister would later testify, according to the Atomic Heritage Foundation. "No one knew it was radioactive fallout. The children played in the 'snow.' They ate it."  The 1954 explosion was part of a series of nuclear tests conducted as the American military lurched into the nuclear age. From 1946 to 1958, 67 U.S. nuclear tests pulverized the tranquil reefs and islands of South Pacific. International pressure finally halted the bombing, but the damage was done - and continues to this day.  That was the message reiterated by U.N. Secretary General António Guterres on a recent tour of the South Pacific to discuss climate change. In Fiji on Thursday, he told the crowd about "a kind of coffin" built by the U.S. in the Marshall Islands to house the deadly radioactive debris from 1980s. The structure, however, was never meant to last. Today, due to disrepair and rising sea tides, it is dangerously vulnerable. A strong storm could breach the dome, releasing the deadly legacy of America's nuclear might.  "I've just been with the...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mediaite.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pete Buttigieg received a standing ovation from the crowd at the end of his Fox News town hall in Claremont, New Hampshire Sunday night. The South Bend, Indiana Mayor and 2020 presidential candidate drew raucous applause throughout his town hall with Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, particularly when he dismissed President Donald Trump's tweets: "I don't care," Buttigieg remarked when asked how he felt about the missives. At the end of the town hall, Wallace gave him time for a closing statement: Look, what we're trying to do here is different. Because the moment that we're in is different. I get that a millennial, midwestern mayor is not what leaps to mind when you think about a prototypical candidate for president. But I also think we're living -- if it's hard to figure out what's going on right now, it's because we are living on one of those blank pages in between chapters of American history. And what comes next could be ugly or it could be amazing. And I believe running for office</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Is-revenge-porn-protected-by-the-constitution-13857363.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bethany Austin learned her fiance had been unfaithful in late-May 2016.  After sharing a home with him for seven years, Matthew Rychlik was having an affair with a neighbor. The relationship was unsalvageable according to court documents; they even argued over how to call off the wedding - Rychlik wanted to tell family and friends it was mutual, Austin wanted to tell them the truth, that Rychlik was cheating on her.  But the situation escalated, and Rychlik told the world in his own way, from his own point of view. According to court documents, he spread rumors about his "crazy" fiancee and announced he was "sleeping at another girl's house" because Austin "never cooks or does house chores," NPR reported.  Then, Bethany Austin admits she sent friends and family a four-page letter that contained text messages between Rychlik and the neighbor, Elizabeth Dreher, including nude photos of Dreher. Austin had access to all of their conversations and photos because she shared an iCloud account with Rychlik, court documents show. Because of that, she received all of his conversations with the neighbor on her own phone. Rychlik and Dreher acknowledged they knew this.  Austin was arrested and charged with a felony: "nonconsensual dissemination of private sexual images," otherwise known as revenge porn.  In a motion filed in March at the Supreme Court of Illinois, Austin challenged the revenge-porn law itself, calling it unconstitutional. Yes, she was a scorned woman. But according to court documents, Austin argued she was exercising "her freedom of speech."  Appeals courts are beginning to take up cases involving the constitutionality of "revenge porn" statutes. Legislation criminalizing these actions has gained traction in most of America. Forty five states, including Illinois, have revenge-porn laws in place. The U.S. Supreme...</description>
