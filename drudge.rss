      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Bitcoin-bloodbath-nears-dot-com-levels-as-many-13037337.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bitcoin's meteoric rise last year had many observers calling it one of the biggest speculative manias in history. The cryptocurrency's 2018 crash may help cement its place in the bubble record books. Down 70 percent from its December high after sliding for a fourth straight day on Friday, bitcoin is getting ever-closer to matching the Nasdaq Composite Index's 78 percent peak-to-trough plunge after the U.S. dot-com bubble burst. Hundreds of other virtual coins have all but gone to zero -- following the same path as Pets.com and other red-hot initial public offerings that flamed out in the early 2000s.</description>

      <title>WEEKEND: Mexico's presidential frontrunner promising revolution. Can he deliver?</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/opinion/article/Mexico-s-presidential-frontrunner-is-promising-a-13036538.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;After two failed attempts, Andrés Manuel López Obrador is on the verge of becoming Mexico's next president.

Sitting in the United States, there's a temptation to view the Mexican vote through the prism of President Trump, a deeply unpopular figure south of the border. But the support for López Obrador - or Amlo, as he's commonly called - is far more about revulsion with the domestic status quo than the current occupant of the White House, no matter what he says about a border wall and who will pay for it.</description>
