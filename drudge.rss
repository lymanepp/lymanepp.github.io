      <title>For AIRBNB employees, dream turns into disillusionment...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/For-Airbnb-Employees-Dream-Turns-Into-14457034.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN FRANCISCO - Last summer, several Airbnb employees wrote a letter to the online room-rental startup's founders.  On behalf of more than a dozen employees, they pleaded to be able to sell their Airbnb stock options. Because Airbnb is privately held, its shares cannot be easily traded or cashed in. So the employees also asked that the company go public, a move that would let them freely sell their shares, said five people who saw or were briefed on the document and were not authorized to speak publicly.  The letter was a sign of the tension that has built up among Airbnb's workers.  According to interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees and investors, most of whom declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, Airbnb's 6,000-person workforce has become increasingly frustrated by not being able to cash in the company stock that was received in compensation packages. Waiting for the startup to go public has become a growing source of stress, many said, preventing some from making career changes, starting a family or moving on with their lives.  Questions about going public have risen to the top of an internal message board where employees vote for topics for executives to address every few months, the people said. The discontent has been exacerbated because Airbnb, which has been valued at $31 billion, doled out two tranches of employee equity that are set to start expiring in November 2020 and in mid-2021; those shares will become worthless if the company is not trading publicly by then, they said.  To try to keep employees happy, Brian Chesky, Airbnb's chief executive, and other top executives have made some adjustments, the people said. They began offering sabbaticals to longtime employees, extended Airbnb's parental leave policy and increased the retirement matching program. They...</description>

      <title>How Antonio Brown's deal with PATRIOTS dissolved in days... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/How-Antonio-Brown-s-deal-with-the-Patriots-14458241.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Oakland Raiders' Antonio Brown-related pain would become the New England Patriots' gain, it seemed at first.  It took the Patriots, six-time Super Bowl champions, only hours to agree to a contract with Brown after he was released by the Raiders following the craziness over his frostbitten feet, helmet grievances against the NFL, practice-field clash with General Manager Mike Mayock and social-media antics. Surely Brown would become a solid locker-room citizen in Coach Bill Belichick's no-nonsense environment, restore his football reputation and assist quarterback Tom Brady to make the Patriots next to unbeatable, right?  But the relationship between Brown and the Patriots unraveled quickly when Brown's off-field behavior took a more disturbing turn with allegations by two women of rape, sexual assault and intimidation. With the NFL investigating and considering whether to place Brown on paid administrative leave, the Patriots decided Friday to release the seven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver, 11 days and one game after announcing his signing Sept. 9.  That decision came amid two sets of deliberations, one by the team and one by the league, that made it appear inevitable that Brown would be taken off the field soon either by the NFL or the Patriots, in the view of some of those close to the case.  Those people described a league investigation that was progressing, with consideration of the allegations by both women, toward the potential placement of Brown on the commissioner's exempt list. The Patriots, meanwhile, dealt with the controversy and media questioning about the accusations and tried to figure out what was the right thing to do, in general terms, and best for their team.  The outcome is that the Patriots move on without Brown while he faces an uncertain NFL future, with the league signaling to any interested...</description>

      <title>BIDEN TAUNTS TRUMP: I'LL BEAT HIM LIKE A DRUM</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Biden-accuses-Trump-of-abusing-power-to-smear-him-14458075.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden hit back Saturday after being swept up in President Donald Trump's latest national controversy, providing an early look at how he'll respond to Trump's attacks.  Last week, The Washington Post reported that Trump pressured Ukraine's president to investigate a company with ties to Biden's son Hunter. Trump's request seemed designed to elicit damaging information about a political rival ahead of the 2020 election.  Biden, the top-polling 2020 Democratic presidential candidate who beats Trump in head-to-head matchups in battleground states and nationwide, said Saturday that if the president did that, it's only because "he knows I'll beat him like a drum."  Biden also challenged Trump to release a transcript of his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.  Biden found himself at the center of a massive political scandal that includes unfounded accusations spread by Trump and his allies that Biden used his influence as vice president to help his son with a business deal.  Trump and his allies reportedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Biden's efforts in 2016 to convince Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, who at the time was also investigating a natural gas company that employed Hunter.  Biden said he knew nothing of his son's business deal and was acting on behalf of the United States, which saw the prosecutor as ineffective at stamping out corruption.  The Biden campaign sent a lengthy memo to reporters Saturday listing quotes from various news outlets, including the Kyiv Post in Ukraine, discrediting Trump's attack.  The memo seems part of a larger Biden campaign effort to get ahead of the story and keep history from repeating itself - if Trump keeps peddling the story, it could dog his campaign just as Hillary Clinton's emails dogged hers. . ..</description>
