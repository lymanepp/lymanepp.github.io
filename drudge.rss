      <title>Tip from 'concerned citizen'...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-tip-from-a-concerned-citizen-helps-a-reporter-13585192.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reporter who exposed Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's racist yearbook photo said a "concerned citizen" led him to the story that has prompted widespread outrage and calls for the Democrat's resignation. Patrick Howley, editor in chief of the website Big League Politics, first reported Friday the existence of a photo on Northam's page of his medical-school yearbook depicting a figure in blackface standing next to another person in a Ku Klux Klan hood. "It's very easy to explain," Howley, 29, said in an interview Saturday. "A concerned citizen, not a political opponent, came to us and pointed this out. I was very offended (by the photo) because I don't like racism.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;pix11.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK — A congresswoman who visited a federal detention center in New York City where inmates have been stuck in cold, dark cells for days said Saturday it was "surreal" to hear the inmates banging on the walls. "I am frustrated. This is America. In America, everyone has rights," said Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat whose district includes the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. "It's a violation of their human rights to be kept in the cold and not to be able to talk to anyone."</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;San Francisco has more drug addicts than it has students enrolled in its public high schools, the city Health Department’s latest estimates conclude. There are about 24,500 injection drug users in San Francisco — that’s about 8,500 more people than the nearly 16,000 students enrolled in San Francisco Unified School District’s 15 high schools and illustrates the scope of the problem on the city’s streets. It’s also an increase of about 2,000 serious drug users since 2012, the last time a study was done. “There is an opioid epidemic in this country, and San Francisco is no exception,” Deputy Director of Health Dr. Naveena Bobba said.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Jussie Smollett was blunt, emotional and defiantly determined Saturday night at a Southern California concert some urged him not to play, telling the crowd before singing a note that he had to go on with the show because he couldn't let his attackers win. "The most important thing I can say is 'thank you so much, and I'm OK," said the "Empire" actor and R&amp;amp;B singer from the stage at the Troubadour in West Hollywood in his first public appearance since he reported to police in Chicago on Tuesday that two masked men had assaulted him and put a rope around his neck while using homophobic and racial slurs.</description>
