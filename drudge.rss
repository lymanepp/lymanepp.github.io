      <title>Anchors from China state TV and FOX facing off...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Anchors-from-China-s-state-TV-and-Fox-are-facing-13900441.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIJING - One is a star of one of President Donald Trump's favorite television networks, Fox Business. The other is a polished debater on Chinese state media known for her confidence in China's rise and scorn for "biased" Western media.  After weeks of back-and-forth sniping on television and Twitter, Trish Regan from the Fox Business Network and Liu Xin from China Global Television Network are facing off Wednesday night on Regan's show to argue on behalf of their respective governments about tariffs and technology.  The debate might be just another weeknight segment for Fox Business, but it's eagerly anticipated in China, where nationalism and distaste for the United States are running high as the White House tightens the screws on Beijing in their ongoing trade dispute.  "With anchorwomen like her, and companies like Huawei, why would China need to worry about its rise?" read a typical patriotic comment on Chinese social media praising Liu, who is one of China's best known faces despite her regular show appearing on an English-language channel.  Hashtags about the upcoming debate have been viewed upward of 150 million times, with some Weibo posts retweeted tens of thousands of times.  Nearly all of China's tightly controlled state media outlets have covered the Liu vs Regan showdown, often framing the anchor as a symbol of Chinese toughness and rationality. Liu's employer CGTN - the international division of China's all-powerful China Central Television network, or CCTV - has hailed the clash between the two anchors as nothing less than a "historic first."  From the Chinese government perspective, the debate may be a small victory before Liu even utters a word on Fox Business. Over the past decade, the ruling Communist Party has invested heavily to push its state media into the global conversation and shape...</description>

      <title>GREENWALD: Indictment of Assange blueprint for making journalists into felons...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/The-indictment-of-Assange-is-a-blueprint-for-13900193.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The U.S. government on Thursday unveiled an 18-count indictment against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, charging him under the 1917 Espionage Act for his role in the 2010 publication of a trove of secret documents relating to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and diplomatic communications regarding dozens of nations. So extreme and unprecedented are the indictment's legal theories and likely consequences that it shocked and alarmed even many of Assange's most virulent critics.  The new indictment against Assange bears no relationship to WikiLeaks' publication of Democratic Party and Clinton campaign documents or any of its other activities during the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, it covers only publication of a massive archive of classified U.S. government documents that revealed a multitude of previously unknown, highly significant information about wars, government and corporate corruption, and official deceit. WikiLeaks, in 2010, published those materials in partnership with some of the largest media outlets in the world, including the New York Times, the Guardian, Der Spiegel, Le Monde and El Pais, outlets that published many of the same secret documents that form the basis of the criminal case against Assange.  With these new charges, the Trump administration is aggressively and explicitly seeking to obliterate the last reliable buffer protecting journalism in the United States from being criminalized, a step that no previous administration, no matter how hostile to journalistic freedom, was willing to take. The U.S. government has been eager to prosecute Assange since the 2010 leaks. Until now, though, officials had refrained because they concluded it was impossible to distinguish WikiLeaks' actions from the typical business of mainstream media outlets. Indicting Assange for the act of publishing would thus...</description>

      <title>True crime with gory footage hottest TV trend in Brazil...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/In-Brazil-true-crime-is-the-hottest-TV-trend-13898873.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAO PAULO - A gunman bursts into a family's home as they gather for dinner. The father throws a chair at him and is shot. The father falls to the floor. He lifts his head weakly and is shot a final time.  Car chases, lifeless bodies, pools of blood. It's not an action movie - it's just another Brazilian morning show.  As the country battles a historic crime wave that has claimed tens of thousands of lives, the staples that once dominated morning television here - celebrity news, cooking advice, feel-good stories - have been replaced with increasingly gory footage of real violence. And Brazilians cannot get enough of it.  In January, "Primeiro Impacto," a show that focuses exclusively on true-crime footage, became the second-most-popular morning program on network television.  The gunshots that are fired around the country at night are replayed on television screens the next morning, accompanied by an action-movie soundtrack. The camera zooms in on body bags. Suspects are circled in red.  In a nation suffering a record spike in killing, the fear is palpable - but so is the anger.  "There's no talking to these thugs," says the show's host, known as Marcão do Povo, or Mark of the People. "They deserve a bullet to the back. That's what thugs deserve."  The surge in violence - a record 64,000 people were killed in 2017, many of them in the gang war over the drug trade - has made Brazil one of the most dangerous countries in the world and left Brazilians clamoring for the tough-on-crime approach they see on television.  Politicians are responding. Promises of harsher sentences for criminals and protections for police officers who kill on the job helped catapult the previously obscure right-wing congressman Jair Bolsonaro into Brazil's presidency last November.  "I'm going to stuff...</description>
