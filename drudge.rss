      <title>After Falwell departure, LIBERTY U faces questions about faith, power, accountability...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/After-Jerry-Falwell-Jr-s-departure-Liberty-15524296.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liberty University students watched their first all-school convocation of the semester one day after their high-profile president, Jerry Falwell Jr., resigned amid personal scandals.  Falwell has been "an inspiration," said Jerry Prevo, a powerful, fundamentalist pastor from Alaska serving as acting president. He told students that Liberty's leaders are committed to the spiritual mission of the university. He also said Falwell had been the "builder of this great campus, which all of us can be proud of."  Then Jonathan Falwell, pastor of the Liberty-affiliated Thomas Road Baptist Church, spoke. He did not mention his brother by name. But he told his audience, in Lynchburg, Va., and around the globe: "So many times we see Christians that are more focused on building their own brand than they are about building the kingdom of God."  There are a lot of universities out there, Jonathan Falwell said, but Liberty is different: It was built to change the world with the gospel. He urged students to be faithful, trust God and avoid temptation.  Some students who heard the two men said the convocation highlighted a key tension at their school. They felt that Prevo was elevating the former president because of his transformation of the university and that Jonathan Falwell was elevating the Christian values they shared.  "I thought Jonathan Falwell, without being too explicit about it . . . he definitely kind of took Jerry to task," said Eli Best, a junior from Alexandria, Va. "But he did it in a way that took us all to task. It was very relevant."  Fallwell Jr.'s departure leaves Liberty at a turning point: Will the school continue its huge success as measured by the school's size, assets and political clout? Or will it return to the more rigorously religious priority of its revered...</description>

      <title>Cost-cutting uncertainty mires Postal Service in more delays...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Cost-cutting-uncertainty-mires-Postal-Service-in-15524127.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Confusion over Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's planned cost-cutting changes has gripped the nation's mail service and threatened to bring even more delivery delays, say postal workers and union officials.  Days after DeJoy testified before Senate and House committees, vowing to prioritize election mail, postal workers disputed his assertions that pandemic-related challenges were to blame for widespread mail slowdowns. They say the holdups are tied to the postal leader's crackdown - since partially suspended - on overtime and other operational changes, as well as the lack of clarity about which of his proposals will ultimately stick.  In Philadelphia, some letter carriers have gone two weeks without a day off, said one postal worker who, like 11 others interviewed for this piece, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fears of reprisal from their superiors. Processing facilities in other parts of Pennsylvania - Scranton, Harrisburg, Lancaster, the Lehigh Valley - have week-long package backlogs. In Florida, some workers are being instructed not to log mail that arrives after carriers have left on their routes, an anathema to long-serving agency employees.  In the Great Lakes region, which includes parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri, managers are unsure whether DeJoy's realignment of the agency will continue, further slowing the daily movement of hundreds of millions of mail items.  "Everyone's clueless," said one region mid-level manager.  In other areas, including California, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin, postal workers say previous delays have been resolved, but employees are bracing for the election and holiday season, and additional changes DeJoy could institute after the Nov. 3 vote. The plans under consideration, described by four people familiar with Postal Service...</description>
