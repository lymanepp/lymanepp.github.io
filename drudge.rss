      <title>The political theater of McEnany's scripted walk-offs...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/The-political-theater-of-Kayleigh-McEnany-s-15384519.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kayleigh McEnany's press briefings don't just draw to a close. They tend to end with a flourish - a true walk-off moment.  It happened again at the White House on Monday. President Donald Trump's press secretary was speaking to reporters when one asked about his denial of reports that Russian operatives offered bounties to Taliban members who kill American troops in Afghanistan. But, a reporter noted, Trump had also claimed that he had never been briefed on the subject - so how could he be certain there were never any bounties?  McEnany was ready for this one.  Quickly flipping pages in her briefing binder, McEnany launched into an extended critique of the New York Times, which broke the Russia story last week. Reading from her notes, she rattled off a series of alleged errors published by the Times in its reporting about Russia over the past four years, including a claim that 17 intelligence agencies had agreed about Russian interference in the 2016 election. (Only four agencies had done so.)  Then she unleashed the uppercut punch: "It is inexcusable, the failed Russia reporting of the New York Times. And I think it's time that the New York Times, and also The Washington Post, hand back their Pulitzers."  Bam!  And with that, McEnany snapped her binder shut and strode out of the briefing room, trailed by the unanswered shouts and murmurs of the White House press corps.  Such dramatic exits have become a signature of McEnany's brief tenure as press secretary. Since taking the job in April, the former Trump-friendly CNN pundit and spokeswoman for Trump's reelection campaign has often waited until the briefing's conclusion - that is, the moment when she determines the briefing is concluded - to unload on the assembled reporters.  The excoriation is typically punctuated by a...</description>

      <title>Risk of catching has started to 'frazzle' Secret Service...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/923672/risk-catching-coronavirus-started-frazzle-some-secret-service-agents</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence continue to host events in areas hard-hit by the coronavirus crisis, the Secret Service agents assigned to look after them are starting to fear for their own health and safety, The Washington Post reports. 'The heightened risk of agents getting sick' while preparing for rallies in states like Arizona and Oklahoma 'has begun to frazzle agents and their families,' the Post reports, citing people close to agents. Their worries aren't unfounded: The Post says Pence was forced to duck out of a 'Faith in America' campaign rally scheduled for Tuesday in Arizona after some of his Secret Service agents displayed coronavirus symptoms and at least one tested positive. Pence postponed his visit until Wednesday so that new, healthy agents could be brought in. This is the second time recently that Secret Service agents have contracted the virus while prepping for an event for the administration. Two agents tested positive before Trump's controversial rally in Tulsa on June 20, and at least eight campaign staff members who helped plan the event have also tested positive. Catherine Milhoan, the director of communications for the Secret Service, told The New York Times that 'the health and safety of our work force, their families, and that of our protectees remains the agency's highest priority.'

      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Infections-increasing-in-night-spots-among-youth-15384327.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time in two months, Tokyo reached triple digits in new coronavirus cases in a single day when it exceeded 100 on Thursday. The surge extended Friday, with the figure reaching 124. Particularly noticeable have been the spread of infections in nightspots and among young people.  The Tokyo metropolitan government remains confident that the medical system has enough capacity to handle the surge, but is becoming increasingly wary about the spread of the virus.  Centered on bustling areas  "We can't rule out the possibility of a rapid increase in new cases from now. We need to exercise more vigilance," Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said at a hastily called press conference Thursday evening, expressing a sense of urgency.  Recently in Tokyo, infections have increased especially among those involved in the night entertainment industry, including workers at host clubs and hostess bars and their customers.  Of those who tested positive for the virus over the seven days through Thursday, about 40% are related to "nightspots." Of those, bustling areas such as Shinjuku and Ikebukuro stand out in particular. There have also been confirmed coronavirus cases at a maid cafe in the Akihabara district.  Another characteristic is that more and more young people in their 20s and 30s are contracting the virus. In April, these age groups accounted for 36% of all people infected, but in the week through Thursday, the percentage doubled to about 70%.  There are many cases of the virus spreading at gatherings or parties in izakaya Japanese pubs. "Young people often show no symptoms, and they participate in a wide range of activities," a senior metropolitan government official said. "There is the fear that they are infecting others without knowing it."  Situation 'different' from April . ..</description>

      <title>Campaign reportedly ready to cancel convention rally...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/923605/trumps-campaign-reportedly-ready-cancel-convention-rally-avoid-tulsalike-humiliation</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poll after poll has shown former Vice President Joe Biden with a growing lead over President Trump, and with COVID-19 cases surging again, the president's approval level is sinking as well. It's all leading Trump to claim 'the polls are all fake' and, when he does believe them, beg for advice to turn it all around, Vanity Fair reports. In recent days, Trump has appeared 'down in the dumps,' Republicans who have spoken with him tell Vanity Fair. 'People around him think his heart's not in it,' one Republican close to the White House said of his campaign. Trump is reportedly stuck between appealing to his base and suburban voters, leading him to even call Fox News' Tucker Carlson last week and beg 'What do I do? What do I do?' In other instances, Trump has appeared in denial of his sputtering campaign and claimed 'the polls are all fake,' a Republican in touch with Trump tells Vanity Fair. But at other times he reportedly believes the polls â€” and blames them on his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. But the reported blame games haven't stopped the bad news from pouring in, namely when it comes to the resumption of campaign rallies where Trump usually thrives. With coronavirus spreading throughout Florida and a mandatory mask policy now in place in Jacksonville, the Trump campaign is reportedly ready to cancel his 15,000-person rally at the Republican National Convention next month 'so that Trump doesnâ€™t suffer another Tulsaâ€“like humiliation,' Vanity Fair writes.

      <title>For TV networks missing sports, there's one unthinkable scenario: Losing NFL season...</title>
      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/For-TV-networks-missing-sports-there-s-one-15382020.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout the spring and into the summer - without the NBA playoffs and baseball's opening weeks - the sports world has continued to feel the steady drumbeat of the NFL. The league opened free agency as usual, providing news-making moments such as Tom Brady signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and then its April draft went off without a hitch, delivering boffo ratings for ESPN.  For the TV networks and sports media outlets that cover the league, this has been most welcome. But as the calendar flips to July, with NFL training camps set to open at the end of the month, doubts have surfaced about the viability of football season. Coronavirus cases are spiking in states across the country. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said football players may need to be in a bubble environment for the season to be played. Los Angeles Rams Coach Sean McVay wondered aloud how teams will be able to both play and take precautions.  "I mean, we're going to social distance, but we play football?" McVay said during a recent media appearance. "It's really hard for me to understand all this."  While there remains plenty of optimism the NFL will play - somehow, someway - networks are now fixated on the league's fall schedule, given its dominant position as America's most valuable television property. They are invested, of course, in the planned returns of Major League Baseball, the NBA and other sports, but none carry the importance of the NFL, which accounted for 41 of the top 50 rated telecasts of any kind in 2019. The lack of certainty has led to uncomfortable conversations among executives.  "It's practically the only thing on the minds of the networks," said John Kosner, a former ESPN executive who is now an industry consultant. "If you lost an NFL season, you're looking at a financial...</description>
