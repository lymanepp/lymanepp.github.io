At that studio, he played a key role in such films as The Godfather, Rosemary\u2019s Baby and Harold & Maude. He later served as Senior Vice President for Production at MGM and, later, as President of Lorimar films. Peter is also the author of nine books, and is a member of PMC's board of advisors."

He was not only nationally recognized as Variety's premiere film reporter but also for his \u201cDish\u201d and \u201cThe Buzz\u201d columns. Mike is known for his industry relationships and his ability to break news wherever it happens, including on the ground at festivals like Sundance, Cannes and Toronto. He also is an author: Doubleday published his book about The Three Stooges, \"From Amalgamated Morons to American Icons,\" which ABC turned into a telepic executive produced by Mel Gibson. One of Mike\u2019s early jobs in journalism was editor of the well-known Media Industry Newsletter (MIN). He then joined New York Newsday as a columnist, reviewer and entertainment writer. During his career, he has written for numerous magazines including Playboy, Details, TV Guide and Esquire."
