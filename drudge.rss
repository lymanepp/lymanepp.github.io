      <title>FACEBOOK reports record revenue...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Facebook-reports-record-revenue-14577228.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook shrugged off months of criticism from regulators and privacy experts Wednesday with record quarterly revenue, revealing advertisers are still flocking to the site.  Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said its third-quarter revenue grew by 29 percent to $17.7 billion. The company's revenue is driven almost entirely by advertising. Those numbers beat estimates from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence of $17.35 billion. Net profit grew 19 percent from the same period a year earlier to $6.1 billion.  The number of users on all of Facebook's platforms combined has grown more slowly than revenue. In the third quarter, monthly active users were up 8 percent to 2.45 billion year-over-year. The company's daily active user numbers beat expectations slightly with 9 percent growth year-over-year to 1.62 billion.  "Now we have a clear path forward, not just in terms of product and business but in terms of guidance from regulators which sets clear expectations and gives us a foundation to build on," chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said during a call with analysts.  On the earnings call, Zuckerberg said the company will continue to accept political ads, which he estimated will constitute 0.5 percent of the company's revenue next year. His comments came the same day Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced that the platform would ban all political ads, beginning in November.  Zuckerberg insisted that the policy is based on its commitment to free speech, not concerns about its bottom line. Democratic presidential candidates and others criticized Facebook this month for declining to remove a Trump campaign ad that contained falsehoods.  "In a democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians or the news," he said.  "This isn't about free...</description>

      <title>Trump without the Trumpiness would win reelection in landslide... </title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/opinion/article/Trump-without-the-Trumpiness-would-win-reelection-14575603.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A thought experiment: Imagine that the president of the United States was a man named Ronald Stump, not Donald Trump. Suppose he was known, before reaching the Oval Office, for delivering thoughtful remarks at the Council on Foreign Relations, rather than for starring in a cartoonish "reality" TV show. Picture him communicating through the White House press office instead of an inflammatory Twitter feed, and cool rather than fiery, and careful as opposed to rash.  Now give this anti-Trump, this Ronald Stump, the same record on which to run for reelection as our real-life President Trump. Give him a persistently strong stock market, record-low unemployment, tame inflation, below-average gasoline prices and bragging rights in a Delta Force raid to administer justice to the founder of the Islamic State. Add to that a passionately happy base of voters savoring a tax cut, a deregulation crusade and a growing army of conservative judges, as promised.  Ronald Stump would be riding high as he enters his reelection campaign. The markers of a two-term presidency are there: a growing economy, a happy political base, a chastened enemy. And given his background and temperament, Stump offends almost no one; he's a uniter, not a divider; he says "Yes, we can" and "Si, se puede." He is affirmative, inspiring. Minus the Trumpiness, President Stump would be thinking in terms of historical landslides.  Trump without the Trumpiness is a fantasy once cherished, but long abandoned, by the conflicted individuals formerly known as Republicans. They've reluctantly come to understand that chaos is intrinsic to this perpetual one-man news cycle. The cartoon-villain vibe, the crazy Twitter feed, the geopolitical rashness and the crude bully-boy are all so baked into Trump's personality that they will matter just as much (maybe more) over the...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;To quote everyone in President Trump's Twitter replies, "there's a tweet for everything." Trump on Wednesday celebrated the news that the U.S. GDP's growth rate had fallen from 2 percent to 1.9 percent. To Trump, that slight drop quantifies "the greatest economy in American history!" The Greatest Economy in American History! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2019 Compare that with how the economy performed back in 2012, when GDP growth similarly dropped to a revised 1.9 percent in the first quarter of the year. That was under former President Barack Obama, so Trump had another opinion on the matter.

      <title>Caught in love triangle, teens hatched murder plot. It couldn't have gone worse...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Caught-in-a-love-triangle-teens-hatched-a-murder-14573939.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roaring up to the Ki-Be Red Apple Market in a Dodge pickup truck, Dalton Pullum and Matthew Phalen had no idea they were about to watch a poorly conceived murder plot unravel before their eyes.  The two high school seniors just wanted to grab lunch in between classes in Benton City, a farming community in the rural eastern half of Washington. But when they pulled up to the grocery store on Nov. 15, 2017, they noticed a strange man skulking around the parking lot in broad daylight. He kept crouching down to hide between parked cars, and, even more suspiciously, was wearing a hoodie and a mask that looked as if someone had cut eye holes in a red T-shirt.  "It was like he didn't have time to get a real mask," Pullum, then 18, told the Tri-City Herald. "Like it was hastily done."  As it turned out, the teens had inadvertently stumbled into a bungled attempt to execute one of their own classmates. A group of fellow students at Kiona-Benton City High School had hatched an ill-fated plot to kill 18-year-old Ryan Vaughn with a kitchen knife during their lunch break, only to be thwarted by freshmen on scooters. The bizarre saga culminated on Monday, when Fe Hadley, Vaughn's ex-girlfriend, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.  The half-baked plan started out as a joke, the Herald reported. Several weeks before the failed murder attempt, a group of teenagers were sitting around, griping about their dislike of Vaughn, then a senior. "What if he died?" someone asked facetiously.  A few members of the group took the question seriously. Hadley, then 16, had briefly dated Vaughn. And Jeremiah Cunningham, who had once dated Hadley, still harbored feelings for her.  Vaughn would later tell detectives that he broke up with Hadley because Cunningham was too protective and overbearing, putting a wedge in their...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Hundreds-of-pets-were-lost-in-the-California-14572942.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The submissions pour in by the second.  Tabby cats lost during an evacuation in the Chalk Hill area of Sonoma County. Two friendly goats, Jean Claude and Spanky, who each respond to "boys!" with a whistle at the end. A black and white Border Collie mix that turned up last Wednesday at Sonoma County Animal Services.  The mishmash of animals - lost and found - comprise just a fraction of those displaced from their owners as the Kincade Fire rages in Northern California. The blaze has already spurred unprecedented blackouts and forced more than 200,000 people to flee their homes, sometimes without warning, causing hundreds of cats, dogs, horses and other livestock to be left behind.  Enter Tai Bruce, the 33-year-old co-creator of Pet Rescue and Reunification, a grass roots Facebook effort to compile posts and notices of missing animals all in one place. Bruce and a team of like-minded volunteers work both online and in the field to identify lost pets, track them down and reunite them with their owners - a tireless effort that will continue long after the fire subsides.  Bruce, a former San Francisco Animal Care &amp; Control reserve officer who now lives in Oregon, said she began the initiative with a few other volunteers during the 2015 Valley Fire , located about 100 miles north of San Francisco. They duplicated their efforts for the similarly-destructive 2017 wildfires in Northern California as well as the deadly 2018 Camp Fire. She says the pattern is similar each time: a flurry of Facebook posts and messages from devastated pet owners, desperately in search of their animals with little idea where to look.  Local shelters, clinics and veterinary offices are a good place to start, Bruce said. But oftentimes, pet owners affected by the sudden evacuation orders possess little identifying information for their animals other...</description>
