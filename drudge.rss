      <title>In Texas, allegiance to Beto vanishing...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/In-Texas-allegiance-to-O-Rourke-is-vanishing-14093220.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;AUSTIN, Texas - Just nine months ago, attorney Katie Baron was so inspired by Beto O'Rourke's Senate campaign in Texas that she commissioned a sprawling mural on the side of a building in east Austinfeaturing the candidate in a Superman-like pose.  After O'Rourke lost race and began mulling a presidential campaign, the artist added a sweeping "2020" in blue paint - providing what seemed to be yet one more call for O'Rourke to get into the crowded race.  Now, four months into O'Rourke's campaign, Baron wishes he had stayed out.  After the first Democratic presidential debate last month, Baron posted an altered picture of the mural on a Facebook page dedicated to the artwork. She had replaced O'Rourke's face with Sen. Kamala D. Harris's and wrote: "Don't worry, still got PLENTY of love for Beto, but Kamala earned herself a little recognition too last night!" The comments filled with messages from angry O'Rourke supporters and a few excited Harris backers.  While Baron says she will be forever grateful to O'Rourke for inspiring her and thousands of others to become politically active, she doesn't think he's the strongest candidate for president, nor has he shown he can nationalize the magic of his Senate campaign.  "If the primary vote was tomorrow, he wouldn't have my vote," said Baron, 35, who likes Harris, D-Calif., for her sharp intellect and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for her methodical policy papers.  "Being part of the Beto-mania that was fueling the fire, I can see why he kind of thought he had no choice but to enter," she said. "Honestly, I did get a little caught up. We were still riding the wave of the midterms."  As O'Rourke slogs through a difficult primary season, he's not only struggling to gain the support of voters who don't know of him, but also to hold...</description>

      <title>These Republicans signed 'never Trump' letters. Now have second thoughts...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/These-Republicans-signed-the-2015-never-Trump-14093205.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two and a half years into President Donald Trump's tenure, the Republican national security heavyweights blacklisted from his administration for signing a pair of "never Trump" letters in 2016 face a crossroads - remain opposed or support him in 2020.  While some have become prominent figures of the anti-Trump resistance - denouncing him in op-eds and on cable news - others have offered policy advice from outside perches, and a select few have quietly, though mostly unsuccessfully, angled for administration jobs, hopeful that a mea culpa could end their days in purgatory.  This weekend, a few dozen once-prominent GOP foreign policy figures, including some original "never Trumpers," will gather at a private Reagan Institute retreat in Beaver Creek, Colorado, to promote and preserve the 40th president's "conservative internationalist" approach to foreign affairs. Yet the White House has shown little willingness to tap into this wellspring of expertise, even as Trump cycles through national security aides and faces a dwindling pool of experienced staffers in a potential second term.  The ostracism of the group has led some to reconsider their roles in a prominent public movement to stop Trump three years ago.  "I'm not comfortable with letters anymore," said Patrick Cronin, head of the Asia-Pacific security program at the Hudson Institute, who signed the first letter, which called Trump "fundamentally dishonest" and "utterly unfitted to the office." In March 2017, Cronin was forced to withdraw from a new position overseeing a Pentagon think tank after Trump allies blasted his appointment by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.  "I don't regret the letter in 2016; I thought it was the right thing to do," said Cronin, who has been publicly supportive of some elements of Trump's policies on China and North Korea. "But I'm not...</description>

      <title>BRAZIL: Greenwald gets death threats after reports on justice minister...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/U-S-journalist-in-Brazil-gets-death-threats-14093234.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO - Glenn Greenwald was jittery. He had another big story in the works, and the atmosphere around his home office was frenetic: Dogs barking, 27 security cameras filming, big men with guns standing guard.  For weeks, from a house transformed into a bunker, Greenwald had published allegations casting doubt on the impartiality of the corruption investigation that led to the imprisonment of former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and contributed to the rise of President Jair Bolsonaro.  In two days, he would publish another story alleging that the judge who'd overseen Lula's case, Sérgio Moro, a national hero in Brazil for his role taking on corruption, had colluded with prosecutors to convict him.  "This material is going to come out," he said. "Even if they put me in prison."  The prospect felt real enough. Greenwald, the polarizing American journalist who came to prominence reporting on the U.S. government surveillance programs exposed by Edward Snowden, had promised months of stories - a steady drip of leaks that could imperil the Bolsonaro agenda. Some members of congress had called for his deportation. Others accused him of committing a crime. Death threats were rolling in.  Most recently, the federal police, commanded by Moro, now Bolsonaro's justice minister, reportedly began investigating Greenwald's finances in a probe that press advocates here see as an attempt to silence him.  The public threats against Greenwald represent an early test for Brazil under Bolsonaro, the right-wing former military officer who won the presidency last year with appeals to nationalism, homophobia and nostalgia for the country's two-decade military dictatorship.  Will this government tolerate damaging reporting by a gay foreign journalist? Or will it move to silence him, confirming fears of Bolsonaro's...</description>
