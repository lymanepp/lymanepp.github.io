      <title>RUDY STUNS: 'I needed Yovanovitch out of the way'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/884544/rudy-giuliani-stunningly-admits-needed-yovanovitch-way</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, that wasn't subtle. In a sweeping article in The New Yorker, focused on Ukraine's former General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko, President's Trump personal lawyer and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was pretty open about his plan to get rid of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Lutsenko reportedly wasn't fond of Yovanovitch, whom he felt favored his rival, the head of Ukraine's new anti-corruption bureau. That seemingly made him a good partner for Giuliani, who was launching a campaign to get Kyiv to investigate the actions of some of President Trump's domestic political rivals in Ukraine. Giuliani has widely been viewed as the leading force behind the movement to drive Yovanovitch out of her role because she was seen as an obstacle to his investigation-related plans, and he admitted as much to The New Yorker. This seems quite problematic to Trumpâ€™s defense about ousting Yovanovitch.â€œI believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way,â€� Giuliani said. â€œShe was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.â€�https://t.co/u7IFgGg8jD â€” Andrew Desiderio (@AndrewDesiderio) December 16, 2019 Giuliani then compiled a dossier on Yovanovitch and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who once served on the board of a Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company at the center of corruption allegations. He went on to coordinate with journalist John Solomon, who interviewed Lutsenko for The Hill, to push the story and force out Yovanovitch. 'I said, 'John, let's make this as prominent as possible,'' Giuliani told The New Yorker. Read more at The New Yorker. Tim O'Donnell</description>

      <title>REPORT: 99% of biggest firms paid no federal tax at all...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/2018-corporate-tax-rate-plunged-to-11-3-under-14909295.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 400 of America's largest corporations paid an average federal tax rate of about 11 percent on their profits last year, about half the official rate established under President Donald Trump's tax law of 2017, according to a report released Monday.  The 2017 GOP tax law lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, but in practice large companies often pay far less than that due to deductions, tax breaks, and other loopholes.  In the first year Trump's tax law was in effect, the actual amount corporations paid in federal taxes on their incomes - their so-called "effective rate" - was an average of 11.3 percent, likely its lowest level in more than three decades, according to a report by the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank.  From 2008 to 2015, under the previous tax code, corporations paid on average an effective rate of about 21 percent, according to ITEP's prior research.  The report also found that 91 corporations in the Fortune 500, many worth billions of dollars, paid no federal taxes at all last year.  "When drafting the tax law, lawmakers could have eliminated special breaks and loopholes in the corporate tax to offset the cost of reducing the statutory rate," the report says. "Instead, the new law introduced many new breaks and loopholes, though it eliminated some old ones."  ITEP looked at the 379 companies in the Fortune 500 that were profitable in 2018 and provided enough information to calculate their tax rates. Researchers excluded taxes incurred by corporations under a one-time "repatriation tax" on money they brought back from overseas due to the tax law, according to Matt Gardner, an analyst at ITEP.  The findings come amid an explosion in the federal deficit, which this year rose to close to $1...</description>
