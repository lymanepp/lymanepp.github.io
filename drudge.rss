      <title>Trump asks for military tanks on Mall as part of grandiose July Fourth event...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Trump-asks-for-military-tanks-on-the-Mall-as-part-14063335.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - National Park Service acting director P. Daniel Smith faces plenty of looming priorities this summer, from an $11 billion backlog in maintenance needs to natural disasters like the recent wildfire damage to Big Bend Park.  But in recent days, another issue has competed for Smith's attention: how to satisfy President Donald Trump's request to station tanks or other armored military vehicles on the Mall for his planned July Fourth address to the nation.  The ongoing negotiations over whether to use massive military hardware, such as Abrams tanks or Bradley fighting vehicles, as a prop for Trump's "Salute to America" is just one of many unfinished details when it comes to the celebration planned for Thursday, according to several people briefed on the plan, who requested anonymity to speak frankly.  White House officials intend to give out tickets for attendees to sit in a VIP section and watch Trump's speech, but did not develop a distribution system before much of the staff left for Asia last week, according to two administration officials. Officials are also still working on other key crowd management details, such as how to get attendees through magnetometers in an orderly fashion.  Traditionally, major gatherings on the Mall, including inauguration festivities and a jubilee commemorating the start of a new millennium, have featured a designated event producer. But in this case, the producer is the president himself.  Trump has demonstrated an unusual level of interest in this year's Independence Day observance, according to three senior administration officials. He has received regular briefings about it from Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, according to the people briefed on the plan, and has weighed in on everything from how the pyrotechnics should be...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Few Americans alive today have set foot inside North Korea, the isolated, nuclear-armed dictatorship sometimes called the Hermit Kingdom.  On Sunday, Ivanka Trump became one of them, capping a consequential three-day Asian trip in which the president's eldest daughter played a very public role that blended family ties with diplomatic work that is usually performed by diplomats.  She pronounced the short walk to the other side of one of the world's most fortified borders "surreal."  Previously, at the Group of 20 economic summit in Japan, Ivanka Trump was everywhere - at her father's side at times when other leaders' spouses were present (first lady Melania Trump skipped the trip), in meetings during which her presence puzzled other participants, and even giving an awkward video "readout" of Trump's meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  A video of Ivanka Trump talking with British Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde at the G-20 also went viral over the weekend. Lagarde's impatient side-eye as Ivanka Trump interjects in what appears to have been a back-and-forth between Macron and May suggested irritation at finding herself standing alongside the daughter of the U.S. president - rather than the president himself.  "As soon as you charge them with that economic aspect of it, a lot of people start listening who otherwise wouldn't listen," May can be heard saying, as Lagarde nods in agreement.  "And the same with the defense side of it, in terms of the whole business that's been, sort of, male-dominated," Ivanka Trump then says, as a startled-looking Lagarde turns toward her, then purses her lips.  The first daughter's prominence in Japan and...</description>
