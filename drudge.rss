      <title>U.S. base near NKorea accidentally blares emergency siren -- instead of taps...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/A-U-S-base-near-North-Korea-accidentally-blared-14933793.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A U.S. Army base in South Korea accidentally blasted an emergency siren Thursday night instead of the somber notes of taps, officials said, igniting brief panic on the base amid North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's threats of an unwelcome "Christmas gift."  Taps, the melancholy bugler's song played at military funerals, was supposed to be sounded on Camp Casey's announcement system at 10 p.m., as is custom at Army installations to mark the end of the day, said Army Lt. Col. Martyn Crighton, a spokesman for the 2nd Infantry Division.  But Crighton said "human error" instead prompted the sounds of an emergency siren wafting through the freezing air throughout Camp Casey, the closest U.S. Army base to the North Korean border - and a likely prime target for missile strikes in the event of an attack.  The mistake bewildered service members on base, who said in a Reddit thread posted soon after the incident that soldiers were "riled up," and some ran through the halls in full uniform before the error was realized.  A short time after that, U.S. Army WTF! moments, a popular digital hangout for soldiers, posted a video it said it received from a soldier at Camp Casey. Crighton said he couldn't confirm the video was from Thursday.  The siren heard is commonly called an air raid siren. That is one function among others to generally warn soldiers to begin "alert procedures," he said.  Soldiers were "immediately" notified of the mistake, and control measures were put in place to ensure it is not repeated, Crighton said, though he did not say how much time passed between the false alarm and notification of the mistake.  Although it is unclear how the incident occurred Thursday, it appears similar to a 2018 incident in Hawaii, when an operator at the emergency management agency accidentally...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today's wild pigs are a hybrid breed, a mixture of two animals that have no place in California. The first is the standard domesticated pig, introduced by Spanish colonizers in the mid-1700s. Russian immigrants also apparently let some loose near Fort Ross in Sonoma in the 1800s. And as Gold Rush settlers flowed into the state, they killed the hogs' biggest predator, the bear. So the once-domestic pig spread, becoming a feral pig out in the wild.</description>

      <title>RAHM EMANUEL:  We are more than our disagreements...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Don-t-sink-to-Trump-s-level-we-are-more-than-the-14932528.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every so often, and frequently with no one paying much attention, something happens in Washington that goes against the grain. This month, House Democrats unveiled articles of impeachment the same morning they announced a deal with the Trump White House updating NAFTA. If everything in Washington centered on conflict, President Donald Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would never have been able to align themselves on a major trade agreement.  And yet there they were, serving up evidence that division and consensus can sit, however uncomfortably, side by side.  What did that moment tell us? Riven though we are, we are also, on many matters, united. The paradox of this moment presents Democrats with an opportunity.  Trump knows that conflict is his lifeblood. Division fit the 2016 zeitgeist, a moment when the electorate was hungry to give the elite a long-awaited comeuppance. And the president can still find plenty of places in the country where his hateful rhetoric finds a hungry audience.  But things have since taken a turn. Today, the president's inability to get more than 45 percent in most polls suggests the electorate's thirst for conflict has morphed into something else - namely, an equal desire for consensus.  Ahead of 2020, voters are desperate for someone who will tap into the lost sense of community that Barack Obama embraced when he famously argued at the height of our national split over Iraq that "there is not a liberal America and a conservative America - there is the United States of America." They are in search of someone who will provide a more accurate picture of how much we agree on, someone who will shine a light on how we can rise above the conflicts that divide us.  The evidence is irrefutable. By a margin of 74% to 21%, Gallup polling this year found that Americans believe trade is an...</description>

      <title>Jane Fonda talks about malaise and 'Fire Drill Fridays'... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/lifestyle/article/Jane-Fonda-talks-about-malaise-and-Fire-Drill-14932432.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane Fonda, 82, is an award-winning actor and a longtime activist. She moved to Washington, D.C., for four months to launch "Fire Drill Fridays," a campaign with weekly demonstrations to focus attention on the urgency of climate-change issues. - - - Q: You've been an activist for a long time. Can you talk about your first exposure to activism? A: I remember very well. I had been living in France for nine years. Married. Child. There were American GIs who were resisting the war. They had been in Vietnam and had deserted, and were in Paris, and looking for compatriots to help them with doctors and dentists and stuff like that. They are the ones that helped me understand the war and what was wrong. Long story short, they gave me a book by Jonathan Schell called "The Village of Ben Suc." And it just rocked me. My life, up until that point - it was glamorous. It was interesting. It was empty. And I was feeling the emptiness. And I just realized, Where have I been? What have I been doing with my life? The worst thing in life is to be going through it and not know why you're there. Not feel that your life has any meaning. So I was totally prepared to throw all of that out and to completely immerse myself into a new world. I left everything, and I moved [back], and I called up [a] person running [antiwar] mobilizations and I said, "I'm Jane Fonda, and I know that there's big things happening around the country. What can I do to help?" He said, "Well, what are your politics?" [Laughs.] And I didn't know - I was so not active, I didn't even know what to say. I thought, Well, I'm going to have to learn really quick a whole lot of things. I didn't learn quite quick enough, but I did my best. Q: Right - you have said of sitting on the enemy aircraft gun on your trip to North Vietnam, "I will go to my grave regretting that." A:...</description>
