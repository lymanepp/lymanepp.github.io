      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Chinese-officials-urge-people-not-to-travel-in-14991226.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIJING - Chinese health authorities sought to impose a quasi-quarantine around Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, Tuesday as they stepped up efforts to stop the spread of a mystery virus that has now claimed six lives.  With confirmation that the pneumonialike coronavirus can be transmitted from person to person, and with hundreds of millions of Chinese packing onto public transport to make their annual pilgrimages home, a new sense of panic has erupted here.  Long lines formed at pharmacies and convenience stores around the country as people rushed to buy surgical masks, with unlucky customers posting photos on social media of bare shelves. People around the country canceled their trips home for the Spring Festival - the most important holiday on the Chinese calendar.  "I don't really dare to go to the airport right now, or even to the movie theater," said Xie Jing, a 33-year-old who works in advertising in Shanghai, where there have been two confirmed cases of coronavirus. She canceled her planned trip home to Sichuan, where two cases are suspected.  "Everyone is being very careful at the moment in Shanghai, everyone is wearing masks on the streets," Xie said.  The Geneva-based World Health Organization said it would call an emergency meeting on Wednesday to decide whether to designate the outbreak as an international public health emergency. Australia and the Philippines are the latest countries with suspected cases of infection.  The virus was first detected on Dec. 31 and was linked to a dirty food market in Wuhan, not far from one of the main train stations, where wild animals including wolf pups and civet cats had been on sale for consumption.  A total of 298 people in China had been confirmed with the virus at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the National Health Commission...</description>
