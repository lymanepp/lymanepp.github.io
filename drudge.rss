      <title>Key differences with Barr...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Mueller-s-statement-highlights-key-differences-13905087.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Departing special counsel Robert Mueller finally spoke publicly Wednesday, and his carefully chosen comments highlight the ways in which he disagrees with his boss, Attorney General William Barr, about the facts and the law surrounding the investigation into President Donald Trump.  "If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that," Mueller said Wednesday.  Barr had that confidence. He declared in March that while Mueller's principal conclusions did not include a determination of whether the president had committed the crime of obstruction of justice, Barr had reviewed the evidence and concluded that Trump did not break the law.  "The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime," Barr wrote to Congress at the time.  In his report and his public remarks, Mueller indicated that he holds a different view on the question of potential presidential crimes, refusing to clear Trump and alluding to Congress' impeachment power as the constitutional arbiter.  Mueller's remarks also made clear how heavily his office relied on a long-standing legal opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel that a sitting president cannot be indicted. That opinion, Mueller said Wednesday, "says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing."  Asked about his disagreements with Mueller, Barr has made a point of emphasizing that when the two men met privately on March 5 to discuss the findings, Mueller said he would not say the president would have been...</description>

      <title>Ex-Tehran mayor confesses to killing his wife on TV...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Former-Tehran-mayor-confesses-to-killing-his-13904200.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Mohammed Ali Najafi turned himself in to Iranian authorities Tuesday night, he wore a nice suit and a smile and was greeted warmly by police.  But Najafi, a former mayor of Tehran, was there to make a confession. He said he had killed his wife, Mitra Ostad, ,the night before after threatening her with a gun because she refused to grant him a divorce.  Najafi, 67, a reformist politician, said he killed her accidentally after surprising her in the bathroom at their home in a wealthy Tehran neighborhood.  The dramatic case, Najafi's bizarre and televised confession, and the hands-off approach of investigating authorities have scandalized, enraged and baffled Iranians, who have long criticized the preferential treatment given to government officials in matters before the law.  State television filmed Najafi, who also once served as education minister and is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as he sat un-handcuffed and casually sipping tea in a police commander's office. The officials shook Najafi's hand and bowed deferentially, while a reporter interviewed him.  "We had an argument and then I showed her this gun to scare her while she was getting ready to take a bath," Najafi said. "She panicked and attacked me in order to take the gun and I mistakenly touched the trigger."  In a separate segment aired by the state broadcaster IRIB, the reporter handles the alleged weapon used in the killing and counts the number of bullets left in the chamber, asserting that two struck Ostad and that a third was fired into the wall.  "So far, [this case] is not a criminal investigation, even by the standards of the Iranian judiciary," Tehran-based lawyer Shady Sadr said on Twitter.  "The tests on the murder weapon, from the finger prints to matching the bullets with...</description>

      <title>How Merkel's succession plan unravelled...</title>
      <link>https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2019/05/how-angela-merkel-s-succession-plan-unravelled</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstatesman.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For German Christian Democrat leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, once regarded as Angela Merkel’s natural successor as chancellor, recent weeks have been politically enfeebling. As the European parliament election results were announced on Sunday night (26 May), it became clear that the Christian Democrats (CDU) had endured their worst-ever nationwide performance (winning just 28.9 per cent of the vote). The consolation for the 56-year-old Kramp-Karrenbauer (known in Germany as AKK) was that the rival Social Democrats (SPD) had fared yet worse. Their vote share of 15.8 per cent left them in third place behind the Greens, who surged to 20.5 per cent. Added to this, the CDU defeated the SPD in Bremen, the city state the centre-left party had governed for over 70 years. Yet, incredibly, AKK has since managed to divert attention away from the CDU’s hapless coalition partners. The party leader repeated her misguided attack on a group of 70 YouTube influencers who urged young voters not to support the ruling parties. On Monday (27 May) she sharply criticised their campaign and spoke of the need for new rules to govern the online sphere, leading to accusations that she was infringing freedom of speech. While AKK’s comments may have been misinterpreted, her decision to refuel the controversy demonstrated remarkable political ineptitude. It’s a trap the sphinx-like Merkel would never have fallen into. It’s not AKK’s first gaffe: a joke about transgender people during a stand-up routine at a festival alienated party moderates. Her approval ratings have notably plummeted since her narrow election victory as CDU leader in December (ending Merkel’s 18-year reign). The more Germans see of AKK, it appears, the less they like her. But it’s the party leader’s wider political strategy that could cause her greater problems. AKK’s move to push the CDU to the right in order to take on the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), has merely opened up the centre ground, which Merkel always sought to occupy, allowing the Greens to rush in. In the European elections, the CDU lost four times as many votes to the Greens as to the AfD. A stunning 1.2 million voters switched from the conservatives to the environmentalist party, almost as many as the 1.5 million who deserted the SPD. Meanwhile, in eastern Germany, the CDU’s attempt to court AfD voters failed, with the far-right party finishing first in Saxony and Brandenburg, both of which hold state elections in September. While the CDU can forgive missteps such as the YouTube controversy, electoral losses are far more serious. Merkel’s centrist trajectory may have been highly unpopular with many sections of the party, but her repeated election victories (she has retained office for 14 years) made her position almost unassailable. Merkel is thought to be increasingly unhappy with her protégé. On Tuesday (28 May), Bloomberg, citing two unnamed German officials, reported that the chancellor had lost faith in AKK’s ability to take on the role and was increasingly determined to remain in office until 2021. At an EU summit on Tuesday evening, however, Merkel described such reports as “nonsense”. Furthermore, Merkel has always suggested that she intends to serve out this legislative period. After that, it’s ultimately up to the party to decide on its candidate for chancellor, not Merkel. More significantly, perhaps, AKK’s internal rivals were already manoeuvring against her. Armin Laschet, the influential CDU leader of North Rhine-Westphalia, pointedly defended press freedom on Tuesday. And Friedrich Merz, an old rival of Merkel’s, who AKK narrowly defeated in the leadership contest, denounced both women over their climate policies in comments to Der Spiegel. If Merz, who is popular with the economically liberal wing of the party, were to oust AKK, it is inconceivable that Merkel could stay on as chancellor. Meanwhile, the increasingly fragile grand coalition — between the CDU and the SPD — could still fall apart. The SPD is reeling from its electoral humiliation and its leader Andrea Nahles is fighting for survival. Many on the SPD left now argue the only way to revive the party is by exiting the grand coalition when it is reviewed this autumn. Yet the SPD’s departure from government could further marginalise them, leaving the Greens to take over as Germany’s main progressive force. The Greens, says Carsten Nickel of political risk firm Teneo, are benefiting from a realignment across Europe as traditional left/right divides are replaced by ones between liberal progressives and conservative nationalists. They have also managed to address young people’s environmental concerns — a remarkable 36 per cent of first-time voters backed them — while exploiting wider dissatisfaction with the government, despite historically low unemployment (5 per cent) and a relatively robust economy. The Greens’ charismatic co-leader, 49-year-old Robert Habeck, is increasingly spoken of as a potential chancellor, either in coalition with the SPD and the Left Party or, perhaps more likely, in a CDU-Green coalition. Yet here too, AKK has demonstrated a lack of political prowess, firmly rejecting many climate protection proposals and failing to take the school strike movement (Friday for Futures) seriously. Her political mishaps mean she will likely face the wrath of her party at a CDU gathering this weekend. Ironically, she called the meeting, without first notifying Merkel, in what was regarded as an unsuccessful attempt to push the chancellor to step down. Yet it is Merkel, still highly popular among German voters, who holds the advantage ahead of the conference. Relatively untainted by the EU election results, she has played the role of global stateswoman this week, delivering a speech at Harvard University, giving a lengthy interview on CNN and sparring with French president Emmanuel Macron over the top EU jobs at a Brussels summit. Meanwhile, if AKK survives the coming weeks, her next electoral test will soon be upon her, with two state elections in September. Should the CDU and the SPD perform poorly, the grand coalition could crumble and AKK would likely never lead the CDU into another election. That would mean the question of who succeeds Merkel — and leads Europe’s largest country — would once again be wide open.

      <title>Lindsey Graham draws Dem challenger who mocks his ties to Trump...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Lindsey-Graham-draws-a-Democratic-challenger-who-13903136.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaime Harrison, the former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, formally kicked off his campaign Wednesday to topple Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., with a video that highlights his humble roots and Graham's evolving views on President Trump.  Harrison, who was the state party's first black chairman and is a former aide to Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., has been encouraged to run by national party leaders in a state that has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1998.  In his announcement video, Harrison highlighted his birth to a 16-year-old mother, his upbringing by his grandparents, his education at Yale University and Georgetown Law School and his return to South Carolina.  The video also included clips of derogatory comments that Graham made about Trump as they both were pursuing the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, including Graham labeling Trump "a kook," "crazy" and "not fit to be president of the United States."  "He's a race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot," Graham said in one highlighted clip.  In subsequent clips, Graham is shown saying, "No, I don't think he's a xenophobic, race-baiting, religious bigot," and that Trump "deserves the Nobel Peace Prize and then some."  "Here's a guy who will say anything to stay in office," Harrison said in the video. "Lindsey Graham can't lead us any direction because he traded his moral compass for petty political gain."  Graham, who is serving his third term, defeated his Democratic challenger in 2014 by more than 16 percentage points. Trump carried the state over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 by 14 percentage points.  In an interview with The Washington Post in March, as he was considering a Senate bid, Harrison said that Graham's reelection "is not a slam dunk for him" given his emergence as a...</description>
