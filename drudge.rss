      <title>Flight from London to Sydney breaks 2 world records...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/878650/flight-from-london-sydney-breaks-2-world-records</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a milestone decades in the making. On Friday, a Qantas airplane loaded with 100 metric tons of jet fuel flew 11,060 miles from London to Sydney, nonstop. The journey lasted 19 hours and 19 minutes, and shattered two records, becoming the longest commercial airline passenger flight for both distance and duration, CNN reports. The new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner departed from Heathrow Airport at 6 a.m. Thursday morning, and flew over Germany, Russia, Poland, Belarus, Kazakhstan, China, the Philippines, and Indonesia. This was a test flight, and while the plane can hold up to 256 people, there were just 50 on board. All passengers were outfitted with monitors, and researchers from Australia's Charles Perkins Centre will study how sleep patterns, movement, and food consumption on an extremely long flight affect a person's health. The last time Qantas attempted to fly this route without stopping, it was 1989. The airline used a Boeing 747, ripping out most of the seats and loading the plane with as much fuel as possible, even towing it to the runway in order to conserve gas, CNN reports. "Flying nonstop from the east coast of Australia to London and New York is truly the final frontier in aviation, so we're determined to do all the groundwork to get this right," Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said. Qantas is hopeful it can start offering nonstop flights from London to Sydney and vice versa in 2022. Catherine Garcia</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/As-smartphones-begin-using-scanned-IDs-skeptics-14837311.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashton Hickey appreciates some of the advanced features on her iPhone 8, like wireless charging and a camera that shoots high-definition 4K video.  But there's one she refuses to use: the fingerprint sensor that lets people access their phones with a single touch. Instead, she continually enters her six-digit passcode.  "I can handle typing that in," said Hickey, a freelance locations coordinator for movies and television shows. And she wouldn't ever consider the facial recognition on the latest iPhones. "Like more and more tech, it's [something] potentially nefarious, disguised as a way to make our life easier."  Hickey is one of a small but passionate group of smartphone owners resisting the recent wave of biometric security features, such as Apple's facial recognition technology and Samsung's iris and facial scans. Instead, they're sticking with passcodes or unlock patterns to access their smartphones even as companies push biometrics as key selling points on the newest thousand-dollar devices.  Avoiding commercial biometric security could be an increasingly difficult feat in the future. Smartphone makers are sticking with the tech and say it is faster and safer to use than a passcode alone. Facial recognition as an ID is already being offered to consumers outside of phones, including at airport check-ins, sports stadiums and concerts.  Computer science experts who study biometrics predict there will only be more options in the coming years, such as voice or heart-rate detection, signature authentication and even devices that can tell who you are by the way you walk. The Pentagon is already working on tools for gait and heartbeat identification.  But the passcode holdouts say they are worried about people gaining access to their phones through faulty fingerprint or face-detection tools. They fret about the security of...</description>
