      <description>&lt;b&gt;extra.ie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The weather in Europe is about to get very intense and Irish temperatures are set to soar. Forecasts across Europe have indicated that temperatures could reach as high as 40 degrees Celsius or more across parts of the continent including Spain, Portugal and France. Spanish weather forecaster Silvia Laplana described the incoming heatwave as 'El infierno' which translates to 'hell' in English. She also tweeted a graphic which showed that most of the Iberian country will experience temperatures in the mid 30s, at least, towards the end of the week.﻿ Dedicated rooms in public buildings in France have been set</description>

      <title>Colorado's snowpack 40 times normal after rare summer solstice dump...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Colorado-s-snowpack-is-40-times-normal-after-rare-14036967.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On summer's opening day, up to 20 inches of snow buried the high terrain of the Colorado Rockies, boosting the state's snowpack to extraordinary levels for the time of year.  The solstice flakes marked a continuation of a snowy stretch that began in January and February and lingered through spring. Even before the solstice snow, The Denver Post wrote, the state's snowpack was "in virtually every numerical sense . . . off the charts." At the time, the snowpack was 751 percent above normal.  Due to the new snow Friday into the weekend, the Natural Resources Conservation Service reported that the state's snowpack ballooned to 4,121 percent above normal as of Monday. This number is so high because ordinarily very little snow is left by late June, and cold temperatures late into the spring helped preserve what fell earlier.  After the weekend blanket of white, the scenes in the high country west of Denver resembled midwinter. Enough snow fell to close roads, while many ski areas reported accumulation, including Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek, Arapahoe Basin and Steamboat Springs.  At Steamboat, snow stakes showed up to around 20 inches Saturday. CNN wrote that the last time this area witnessed snow this late in the season was June 17, 1928. It averages just 0.1 inches in June and normally sees its last day of snow around May 6.  At Arapahoe Basin, so much snow has fallen since the winter that it has stayed opened for skiing on weekends through the month. It declared Saturday a powder day after a fresh coating of two inches. The resort plans to open again next weekend and possibly over the July 4 weekend, its blog says.  The snow was triggered by an unusually cold pool of air at high altitudes over the western United States combined with a vigorous weather disturbance that...</description>

      <title>Bernie faces new kind of threat in Elizabeth Warren... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Bernie-Sanders-faces-a-new-kind-of-threat-in-14039192.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Bernie Sanders campaign, facing a new challenge in the rise of Elizabeth Warren, has settled for now on a careful if sometimes awkward strategy: emphasizing Sanders's unique position in the liberal movement, while avoiding direct attacks on Warren and rolling out plans that overlap with her attention-grabbing ideas.  That approach was on display Monday as Sanders introduced a proposal to cancel all student debt across the country. His plan came less than two weeks after Warren announced her own idea for scrapping student debt, one that would cover fewer people than Sanders's would. "Under the proposal we introduced today, all student debt would be canceled in six months," Sanders said.  But doubling down on his ideological purity and socialist credentials carries risks for the senator from Vermont, other Democrats say. It's enabled Warren to position herself as impassioned but reasonable, while Sanders holds down the leftward flank of the Democratic Party and serves as the ideological outlier in the race.  "They both have a crusader mentality around correcting what is wrong," said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who knows both and has not yet endorsed in the contest. "They understand they are speaking to a similar vision of the country, and obviously they are trying to distinguish themselves from each other."  For Sanders, the threat from Warren, D-Mass., is different from any he's faced during his long political career, including in his 2016 presidential run, since Warren in many ways embraces the same brand of fiery liberalism.  Among some Sanders allies, there is private frustration that Warren is getting credit for ideas that they believe originated with him. And that frustration is starting to show.  Last Friday, Warren released a plan to end private prisons. That same day, Sanders adviser Josh Orton...</description>
