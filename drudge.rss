Kamala Harris, D-Calif., often invokes her East Bay upbringing as the child of civil-rights activists to explain her political philosophy. At a rally Sunday in her hometown of Oakland, she officially launched her presidential campaign by tapping those same populist themes. Before an estimated 20,000 people who filled the streets around an American flag-draped Frank Ogawa Plaza, Harris made her opening 2020 pitch: She will be the candidate who is both “a fighter for the people” and someone who can unite a country severed into partisan corners by saying that “we must seek truth, speak truth and fight for the truth.” “People in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other.</description>

      <title>WILLIE BROWN: Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what?</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve been peppered with calls from the national media about my “relationship” with Kamala Harris, particularly since it became obvious that she was going to run for president. Most of them, I have not returned. Yes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker. And I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco. I have also helped the careers of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and a host of other politicians. The difference is that Harris is the only one who, after I helped her, sent word that I would be indicted if I “so much as jaywalked” while she was D.A.</description>
