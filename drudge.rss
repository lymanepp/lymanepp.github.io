      <title>Kamala tries to turbocharge campaign but faces lingering questions...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Kamala-Harris-tries-to-turbocharge-her-campaign-14075701.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DES MOINES, Iowa - When Sen. Kamala Harris arrived in Iowa for the first time since her attention-grabbing debate performance, she did so with a revamped stump speech and almost double her previous forces in Iowa and New Hampshire, all part of a retooled approach her campaign hopes will ensure her breakout moment fosters lasting momentum.  Harris' campaign team says many of these changes were planned far earlier. But they are coming at a pivotal moment - just after the first Democratic debate and as the candidates are separating into more-distinct tiers. Harris' push to sharpen her message and expand her operation is shifting the overall dynamic of the contest for the Democratic presidential nominee.  In returning to Iowa this week, Harris jettisoned a stump speech that centered on the vague notion of "speaking truth" and offered little clear reason for her candidacy. Instead, she is promoting the idea of a changing country - "our America" - in contrast with what she characterizes as President Donald Trump's effort to take the nation back into the past.  She has also begun embracing her controversial history as a prosecutor instead of shying away from it, telling voters that her record of taking on predators (she includes in that "big banks, big pharmaceutical companies, transnational gangs, and more") equips her to prosecute the "predator living in the White House."  And after months of criticism from Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire who said they felt she had not made them a priority, Harris has hired 35 additional staffers in Iowa in recent days, raising her total in the state to about 65 - one of the largest teams on the ground here, according to people familiar with Iowa campaign operations. And she hired 25 additional staffers in New Hampshire.  "I think, early on, she didn't have much ground game in Iowa in...</description>
