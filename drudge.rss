      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Beijing-calls-for-a-people-s-war-against-the-US-13843480.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getty Images / Thomas Peter-Pool    The US-China trade war has dramatically escalated over the past few days, with both sides announcing tariff increases on billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods.   Chinese state media - which functions as a Communist Party mouthpiece - issued a series of rabble-rousing statements on Monday accusing the US of "greed and arrogance" and calling for a "people's war" against it.   President Donald Trump's administration on Monday night threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25% on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.   If such tariffs were to be imposed, almost all Chinese imports to the US would be subject to tariffs.   Trump tweeted on Tuesday that his "respect and friendship" with Chinese President Xi Jinping was "unlimited" but that "this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn't make any sense."

The US-China trade war continues to heat up, with Beijing calling for a "people's war" against Washington and President Donald Trump threatening to impose tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.

      <title>Alabama abortion bill's restrictions weigh on Republicans ahead of vote... Developing...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Alabama-abortion-bill-s-restrictions-weigh-on-13842575.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;OXFORD, Ala. - On Monday, a day before Alabama lawmakers were scheduled to vote on a bill that would all but ban abortion in the state, Republican Del Marsh, president of the state senate, asked a group of young mothers - toddlers bouncing on their laps - what they want the Legislature to do.  "How do y'all feel about banning abortion, even in cases of rape and incest?" he asked the women, who gathered at tables outside a Southern Girl Coffee truck here, on the edge of Talladega National Forest, about 100 miles from Montgomery.  "I'm praying for y'all, and I wouldn't want your job," sighed Lauren Holland, 32, her 2-year-old daughter climbing on her chest. She said she would have the baby if she were raped, but making that the law? "That there is real hard for women. I'm a Christian. One-hundred percent pro-life. But I don't think I want that in the law."  Marsh asked the women to keep praying for him as he navigates a contentious fight that could put Alabama on the leading edge of the anti-abortion push to get a state law in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. He, like many other Republicans here, has long been against abortion and wants the court to overturn Roe v. Wade - and he embraces the strategy of a bill that will force the issue. But he also long has been accepting of three exceptions to bans on abortion: cases that involve rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger.  Marsh and some others in the Republican majority here are struggling with Tuesday's vote on an abortion ban, largely because it is so restrictive. Any unborn baby is innocent and deserves a chance at life, the bill's backers argue, even those that are the result of violent or criminal origins.  "It's just, I'm not real comfortable with having a law that forces a woman to carry a baby after rape," Marsh said.  A move to amend the bill last week...</description>

      <title>Last-minute change of heart foiled secret plot to oust Maduro...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Inside-the-secret-plot-to-turn-senior-Venezuelan-13842388.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Late one night in April, a week before Venezuela's opposition launched its abortive uprising, four men sat on the terrace of the hillside compound in Caracas belonging to the chief justice of the country's Supreme Court. The dim lights of the capital twinkling below them, they sipped Fiji bottled water as they plotted the ouster of President Nicolás Maduro.  Maduro's spy chief, Gen. Christopher Figuera, and Cesar Omaña, a 39-year-old Venezuelan businessman based in Miami, were trying to seal a deal hashed out over weeks with Maikel Moreno, the chief justice, according to one of the participants in the meeting. Figuera and Omaña were part of the plan to force Maduro out, but they needed Moreno's help.  Moreno, sitting before an ashtray laden with the stubs of Cuban cigars, appeared to be having doubts. The 53-year-old jurist voiced concerns about Juan Guaidó, the U.S.-backed opposition leader who would become the nation's interim president if the plot succeeded.  Then, according to the participant, Moreno offered another candidate to "temporarily" lead the broken country - himself.  "In the end, he was trying to safeguard his own power play," one senior opposition figure said.  This account is based on hours of interviews with three people familiar with the talks: the participant, a senior opposition official who was kept informed on the developments, and a senior U.S. official briefed on the talks. The account also sheds new light on the key question of what went wrong in the Venezuelan opposition's high-stakes move to oust Maduro on April 30.  The three people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal tactics, said Moreno's hesitant pledge to cooperate - and then his reversal - played a crucial role in the plan's collapse.  The failure of the...</description>

      <title>Pompeo crashes EU diplomat meeting -- but changes few minds...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Pompeo-crashes-Brussels-meeting-of-EU-diplomats-13840292.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BRUSSELS - Secretary of State Mike Pompeo crashed a meeting of European foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday to push for a united transatlantic front against Tehran and its nuclear program. But he failed to bend attitudes among leaders who fear the United States and Iran are inching toward war.  Pompeo's last-minute decision to visit the European Union capital, announced as he boarded a plane from the United States, set up a confrontation between the top U.S. diplomat and his European counterparts, who have been scrambling to save the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in the wake of the U.S. withdrawal last year. At least one, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, said he feared that unintentional escalation from the United States and Iran could spark a conflict - an unusually bold statement that appeared to assign equal culpability to Washington and Tehran.  The visit came on a day that the Saudi Foreign Ministry said two of its oil tankers and a Norwegian ship were damaged near the Persian Gulf, in what it claimed was an "act of sabotage."  A statement from Thome Ship Management, the owners of the Norwegian-flagged vessel, said an "unknown object" had created a hole in the hull of one of its ships, the MT Andrea Victory. Photographs of the ship show a hole just above the waterline.  Neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE produced photographs to support claims that Saudi tankers had incurred "significant damage." The incidents did not cause casualties or oil spills, according to a statement by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih.  The countries stopped short of assigning blame, but the incidents occurred at the same time and in the same place off the coast of the United Arab Emirates only days after the United States dispatched warships and bombers to the area to deter alleged...</description>
