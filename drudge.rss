      <title>Maine families facing elder boom and worker shortage in preview of nation's future...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/A-catastrophic-trend-in-Maine-A-shortage-of-14305176.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DOVER-FOXCROFT, Maine - Janet Flaherty got an alarming call last October from the agency tasked with coordinating in-home care for her 82-year-old mother. It could no longer send her mom's home caretaker. It knew of no other aides who could care for her mother, either.  Flaherty's mother, Caroline, has for two years qualified for in-home care paid for by the state's Medicaid program. But the agency could not find someone to hire amid a severe shortage of workers that has crippled facilities for seniors across the state.  With private help now bid up to $50 an hour, Janet and her two sisters have been forced to do what millions of families in a rapidly aging America have done: take up second, unpaid jobs caring full time for their mother.  "We do not know what to do. We do not know where to go. We are in such dire need of help," said Flaherty, an insurance saleswoman.  Across Maine, families like the Flahertys are being hammered by two slow-moving demographic forces - the growth of the retirement population and a simultaneous decline in young workers - that have been exacerbated by a national worker shortage pushing up the cost of labor. The unemployment rate in Maine is 3.2 percent, below the national average of 3.7 percent.  The disconnect between Maine's aging population and its need for young workers to care for that population is expected to be mirrored in states throughout the country over the coming decade, demographic experts say. And that's especially true in states with populations with fewer immigrants, who are disproportionately represented in many occupations serving the elderly, statistics show.  "We have added an entire generation since we first put the safety net in place but with no plan whatsoever for how to support them," said Ai-jen Poo, co-director of Caring Across Generations, which advocates for...</description>

      <title>President lashes out at fed for 'CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE!'</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/859058/exacerbating-recession-fears-trump-diverts-blame-fed-crazy-inverted-yield-curve</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The president has weighed in on the possibly, but maybe not actually ominous inverted yield curve. President Trump isn't a fan of the "crazy" inversion, but unlike many of his critics who have placed America's trade war with China front and center when it comes to reasons why a global recession might be looming, he's pointing to a different problem â€” and it's not one of the items on Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman's smorgasbord of economic issues, either. No, Trump's mad at the Federal Reserve, like he has been for a while. The president frequently clamored for the Fed to slash interest rates, and even though Fed Chair Jerome Powell did eventually cut rates in July, Trump has deemed the action far too little, too late. ..Spread is way too much as other countries say THANK YOU to clueless Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. Germany, and many others, are playing the game! CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE! We should easily be reaping big Rewards &amp; Gains, but the Fed is holding us back. We will Win! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2019 Many economists don't agree with Trump. Krugman, for instance, doesn't place sole responsibility for the global economy's teetering on the trade war, but he does consider it a factor. Meanwhile, The Washington Post also reports that the trade war, often through indirect effects like a decline in business confidence and investment, has played a major role in the slowdown. Considering markets closed with their biggest point declines of the year soon after his tweet, it's clear Trump didn't do much to mollify spooked investors. Tim O'Donnell</description>

      <title>'Like horror movie': Camper saves family from savage wolf attack...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Like-a-horror-movie-Camper-saves-family-of-14303149.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was about half past midnight when Russ Fee woke up to the sound of frantic shouts coming from a campsite next to his in Canada's Banff National Park. From within his tent, he listened, quickly discerning that the voices belonged to a man and a woman. They were screaming for help.  "I threw my shoes on. My wife tossed me a lantern," Fee said in an interview Tuesday with the radio show "Calgary Eyeopener." "I popped out of the tent and just started running toward their tent sort of yelling, 'I'm here! I'm here! What's wrong?'"  Fee, who is from Calgary, told the program that he expected to find "two really scared parents" whose child had wandered off into the woods. Instead, the sight that greeted him was much more distressing.  The family's tent was in shambles, Fee said, and sticking out of its entrance was the rear end of a large wolf.  In what officials with Parks Canada are calling a "very rare incident," a wolf attacked a New Jersey couple and their two children who were visiting the national park in Banff, Alberta, early Friday - a harrowing encounter that may have ended differently if it weren't for Fee's quick thinking, Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported.  "We are forever grateful to Russ who came to our aid," Elisa Rispoli, whose husband, Matt, was injured in the attack, wrote on Facebook. Describing Fee as a "guardian angel," Elisa added that the Canadian man probably saved her husband's life.  "It could have been so so much worse, and we are just feeling so thankful that we are all still sitting here as a complete family," she wrote.  The Rispolis were asleep in their tent at the park's Rampart Creek Campground when they were jolted awake after midnight by the wolf.  "It was like something out of a horror movie," Elisa wrote in the Facebook post.  Matt...</description>

      <title>Flight attendant who contracted measles dies amid rise in outbreaks...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Israeli-flight-attendant-who-contracted-measles-14301329.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;An Israeli flight attendant died after contracting measles and falling into a coma, Israeli media reported Tuesday, the latest incident amid growing measles outbreaks worldwide.  More cases of the virus were reported in the first half 2019 than in any other year since 2006, the World Health Organization announced Monday. Compared to this time last year, there have already been nearly three times more reported cases of measles. While many of the measles outbreaks occurred in places with low vaccination rates, the WHO said, others are occurred in nations that have high rates, resulting from "lack of access to quality healthcare or vaccination services, conflict and displacement, misinformation about vaccines, or low awareness about the need to vaccinate."  "The United States has reported its highest measles case count in 25 years," the WHO said in the announcement.  The woman, a mother of three, is just the third death from measles in Israel in the past 15 years, according to the Times of Israel. In 2018 an 18-month-old child and an 82-year-old woman also died from the virus.  In a statement to the Jewish Press, the airline, El Al, said that "the company is bowing its head over the death of a member of El Al's aircrew. The company will continue to act on the matter in accordance with the health ministry's guidelines. Once the case became known, the company acted to vaccinate the company's aircrews. The company shares the deep grief of the family and will continue to accompany the family."  The Washington Post reported on April 17 that the 43-year-old flight attendant had flown in late March on an El Al flight from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Israel and was later admitted to the hospital after developing encephalitis, a complication of the illness in which the brain swells.  In early April, the...</description>
