**Proposed Constitutional Amendment:**

**Preamble**: In order to restore the principles of limited government as envisioned by the Founders, to ensure fiscal responsibility, and to adhere strictly to the Constitution and the Tenth Amendment, we propose the following amendment. This amendment seeks to limit the scope and size of the federal government, eliminate unconstitutional federal departments and agencies, and establish stringent fiscal policies to prevent excessive spending and national debt. It reinforces the need for government operations to be constitutionally grounded and respects the powers reserved to the states and the people under the Tenth Amendment. Additionally, it ensures that the federal budget is balanced annually, with expenditures strictly regulated. By doing so, we aim to promote a more efficient, accountable, and sustainable government for the benefit of current and future generations.

**Section 1**: Only federal departments and agencies which were explicitly authorized by the Constitution shall receive funding of any type from the federal government. Those are the Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of the Treasury, Department of Justice, and the Department of Commerce. All other federal departments and agencies shall be defunded within four years of the ratification of this amendment, with a phased implementation to ensure the orderly transition to constitutional governance. The remaining departments shall only perform functions explicitly authorized by the Constitution. Detailed definitions of authorized functions and examples shall be provided, and any ambiguity resolved in favor of restricting functions.

**Section 2**: Upon ratification of this amendment, the 16th Amendment to the United States Constitution is hereby repealed. Congress shall not levy taxes on income, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, nor without regard to any census or enumeration. Permissible forms of indirect taxation shall include, but are not limited to, sales taxes, tariffs, duties, and excise taxes. Any tax that effectively taxes personal income or wealth, regardless of its structure, shall be prohibited.

**Section 3**: A balanced budget shall be required for each fiscal year. Congress shall not authorize total expenditures exceeding total revenues in any fiscal year.

**Section 4**: The total expenditures of the federal government in any fiscal year shall not exceed 4% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States, except as provided in Section 5. An additional 4% of GDP may be used to retire any debt accumulated by the federal government. A standard, publicly available method for calculating GDP shall be mandated, and independent audits of federal expenditures shall be required. A non-partisan oversight body shall review and report compliance.

**Section 5**: During times of declared war as authorized by Congress, or in cases of national emergency as determined by a three-fourths majority of both houses of Congress, the provisions of Section 3 and Section 4 may be exempted. Any exceptions shall be limited in duration to the period of war or national emergency and shall not extend beyond one fiscal year without renewed authorization. Criteria for national emergencies shall be narrowly defined and subject to judicial review for renewals beyond one fiscal year.

**Section 6**: Congress shall enact appropriate legislation to enforce the provisions of this amendment, including mechanisms for calculating GDP, monitoring federal expenditures, facilitating the phased abolition of federal departments and agencies lacking explicit constitutional authorization as specified in Section 1, ensuring compliance with the fiscal limits set forth in Section 4, and enforcing the balanced budget requirement specified in Section 3. Specific benchmarks and timelines shall be established, with automatic judicial review of the adequacy of such legislation and penalties for non-compliance.

**Section 7**: Members of Congress shall not receive compensation or accumulate pension benefits during any fiscal year if Congress fails to create a balanced budget by the start of that fiscal year, as required in Section 3, or if Congress fails to enact the legislation necessary to enforce the provisions of this amendment as specified in Section 6.

**Section 8**: No provision of this amendment shall be construed to limit the power of Congress to raise revenue through indirect taxes, duties, imposts, or excises necessary to fund the authorized expenditures of the federal government within the limits set forth in this amendment.

**Section 9**: This amendment shall take effect [specify date] following its ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures or by conventions in three-fourths of the states, as determined by Congress.
