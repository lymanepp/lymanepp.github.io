      <title>Kellyanne and George Conway's tawdry love triangle with all of us...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Kellyanne-and-George-Conway-s-tawdry-love-14504402.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm beginning to wonder whether George and Kellyanne Conway have enlisted us all into a private fetish - a relationship-spicing exercise defined by mutual debasement and public shame. We now know too much about the marriage between two prominent Republicans. Not the nitty-gritty of who snores and who loads the dishwasher wrong, but the vast cosmic business, like who has apparently lost all semblance of respect for who's lifelong wedded partner.  George Conway, according to the succinct bio accompanying the essays he publishes in national media sharply criticizing the Trump administration, is "a lawyer in New York." Which is true, but this description is like calling George W. Bush "a painter with an exhibit at the Kennedy Center." Also true, weirdly, but that's not why anybody's buying tickets.  George Conway is known for is being a vehement Never Trumper, but what he's really known for is being the husband of Kellyanne Conway. Who is herself a senior counselor to President Donald Trump.  George has become the toast of the resistance. Not because of what he says; scores of learned experts have spent the past three years furiously penning similar arguments. He has become the toast of the resistance mostly because we know who his wife is. He's riding her coattails while on an apparent mission that would, ultimately, put her out of a job. Which makes the whole thing more ... diabolical? More squalid? More delicious?  "There is a cancer in the presidency," George wrote in April; in June he described one of Trump's briefs as "spectacularly anti-constitutional." He seemed to peak in July, calling his wife's boss "racist," as well as "boorish, dim-witted, inarticulate, incoherent, narcissistic and insensitive." Then, last week he hit a new apex with a massive 12,000 word piece in the Atlantic, whose scathing contents, while...</description>

      <title>Conservatives call for 'expeditious' probe...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Conservatives-call-for-expeditious-impeachment-14506081.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - More than a dozen prominent conservative lawyers, including George Conway, offered their legal reasoning for an "expeditious" impeachment probe into President Donald Trump, creating a document they hope will be read by Republicans who continue to stand by the president.  The 16 attorneys, many of whom worked in Republican administrations, wrote in a joint statement to be released Thursday morning that Trump's now infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the text messages between diplomats and Trump's public call for China to investigate a political opponent are "undisputed" events that amount to Trump violating his oath of office.  "We have not just a political candidate open to receiving foreign assistance to better his chances at winning an election, but a current president openly and privately calling on foreign governments to actively interfere in the most sacred of U.S. democratic processes, our elections," they wrote.  Conway, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and outspoken Trump critic, helped form a coalition of like-minded conservatives a year ago who wanted to call out what they deemed illegal and unconstitutional behavior by the president. The signatories are members of that group, Checks and Balances.  Paul Rosenzweig, who served as President George W. Bush's deputy assistant secretary for policy at the Department on Homeland Security, said he personally would have gone further than the group's comments, which are stern, but measured in tone.  "It strikes me that no reasonable attorney can doubt that there was a quid pro quo here," said Rosenzweig, referring to Trump's holding back military aid to Ukraine while requesting the country investigate a political foe.  "I would vote for impeachment, and I would vote for conviction and removal in the Senate as well,"...</description>

      <title>PG&amp;E pleads for employee safety; Vehicle hit by gunfire...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/PG-E-pleads-for-employee-safety-amid-outage-14505820.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Officials at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. on Wednesday called for the public to let employees do their jobs safely amid frustrations with a widespread California power shutdown, after authorities reported that a bullet was fired at one of the energy provider's vehicles.  The plea came the same day that police say a threatening letter was reported at a PG&amp;E facility, as the utility switched off electricity to hundreds of thousands of people. The planned outage - the biggest in the state's history, announced as a measure to reduce wildfire risk - comes as PG&amp;E faces massive liabilities for starting a blaze that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise last year.  "We realize and understand the impact and the hardship as the result of this decision that we've made," Sumeet Singh, vice president of PG&amp;E's Community Wildfire Safety Program, said at a news conference. But employees and contractors "have families that live in your communities, they have friends that are members of your communities," Singh added. "So let's just ensure their safety as well as they are doing this work in the interest of your safety."  Power companies worried about California's devastating wildfires are increasingly turning to planned shutdowns. PG&amp;E says this latest, unusually disruptive measure, which could last several days, was prompted by the dry winds like those that helped fuel disastrous fires before. The outages have upset customers, closed schools and workplaces and raised fears that people who rely on electricity for medical needs could be caught unprepared.  Some have questioned this week's shutdown, which PG&amp;E expects to affect 800,000 people, as excessive. About 650,000 customers were expected to lack power Wednesday evening, according to the company.  "This cannot be something that can be acceptable nor...</description>
