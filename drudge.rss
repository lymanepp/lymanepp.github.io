      <title>Pentagon issues forceful rebuke of ORACLE as debate over massive federal contract turns caustic...</title>
      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/Pentagon-issues-forceful-rebuke-of-Oracle-as-14268151.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Pentagon has issued an unusually strong rebuke of Oracle over the weekend, accusing the company of employing "poorly-informed and often manipulative speculation" in its efforts to undermine the military's process of awarding a massive 10-year contract for cloud computing technology.  The remarks were the latest flash point in the long-running dispute over the bidding process for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, a $10 billion contract that would be one of the federal government's most expensive information technology procurements ever.  Oracle alleged in a lawsuit that the Defense Department's bidding process has been plagued with potential conflicts of interest and rigged in favor of Amazon's cloud computing business. Oracle's attempt to block the award was rejected earlier this month, with the judge in charge of the case explaining his reasoning in a lengthy document unsealed Friday. But in his decision, the judge posed new questions about the Pentagon's legal argument for awarding one big contract.  Department of Defense spokeswoman Elissa Smith noted in a statement that the judge also affirmed that the Pentagon was "reasonably justified" to award a single contract. Despite the "tension" in the judge's ruling, the department has said it plans to move ahead and award the contract in August, nearly a year and a half after it was announced.  Smith's statement, which was emailed to reporters Sunday night, also contained the harsh words for Oracle. Smith appeared to take a second swipe at the company as well: "DOD officials directly involved in the work of this procurement along with the senior leaders charged with making the critical decisions related to JEDI have always placed the interests of the warfighter first and have acted without bias, prejudice, or self-interest.
