      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Weeks-before-Iowa-caucuses-Sanders-goes-on-the-14970045.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa - Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign has suddenly gone on the attack as he seeks to secure an opening victory in the early February caucuses, engaging in a rare dispute with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, tussling with former vice president Joe Biden and drawing an insult from President Donald Trump.  Although Sanders, I-Vt., mostly had resisted comparing himself with other candidates, over the weekend, his surrogates and aides intensified their attacks on Biden, targeting his past positions on racial issues and his vote to sanction the Iraq War.  At the same time, his campaign went after Warren, D-Mass., with whom Sanders has shared a nonaggression pact for much of the primary season. A script first reported by Politico told Sanders' volunteers to tell voters they called on Sanders' behalf who had indicated support for her that Warren's popularity was limited to the rich and educated - effectively denigrating her electability.  Both candidates struck back either personally or through their own surrogates on Sunday.  Warren told reporters in Iowa that she was "disappointed" with Sanders' campaign script painting her as an elitist. She used the opportunity to warn about "factionalism" that led to Democrats losing the White House in 2016, a reference to the belief by many Democrats that Sanders and his supporters failed to sufficiently support Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump.  "I hope Bernie reconsiders and turns his campaign in a different direction," Warren added.  Trump put an exclamation point on the Democratic infighting, calling the senator "Crazy Bernie Sanders" in a tweet and telling his followers to "stay tuned." A Trump campaign aide said to expect the president to mount a full-throttle attack on Sanders in the coming days.  Sanders'...</description>

      <title>McConnell walks tightrope...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/McConnell-walks-impeachment-tightrope-14969962.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FLORENCE, Ky. - It is not easy these days to lose as a Republican running in ruby-red Kentucky. But that is what happened here in November in the governor's race, when the caustic incumbent managed to alienate enough of his base to fall just short.  This year, another polarizing and unpopular Republican will be up for reelection in the Bluegrass State. But Mitch McConnell has at least one key advantage that former governor Matt Bevin did not: As perhaps the most powerful man on Capitol Hill, he is positioned to drive a stake through efforts to oust a Republican who remains indisputably admired among Kentucky voters: President Donald Trump.  The Senate majority leader's insistence that he will coordinate Trump's impeachment trial with the White House - and that he has no intention of being impartial - has provoked howls of protest from Democrats. On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused McConnell of orchestrating a "coverup" of Trump's actions.  It has also prompted speculation that he could jeopardize his slender majority by exposing Republicans in swing or Democratic-leaning states to accusations that they went along with a rigged process running counter to the Constitution.  But here in Kentucky, it just looks like savvy politics.  The 77-year-old is expected to face a vigorous challenge in November from a decorated Marine fighter pilot with a record of big-dollar fundraising. Yet McConnell has shown an unerring instinct for self-preservation across six Senate terms and a record stint as Republican leader.  Analysts say his impeachment strategy is just more evidence that he is playing to win.  "It's the safest move he could make," said Ryan Salzman, a politics professor at Northern Kentucky University. "Anything that even appears he's going against...</description>

      <title>Girls thought they were dating a teen boy. It was an adult woman...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Girls-thought-they-were-in-a-relationship-with-a-14968020.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake Waton won over teenage girls on social media, swapping flirty messages and intimate pictures with them online before meeting them in person. For many of them, the 16-year-old was the first boy they dated.  But Jake Waton was actually Gemma Watts - an adult woman. The British 21-year-old posed as a teen boy to groom and sexually assault girls as young as 13, wearing baggy clothing and tucking her long hair under a hat to fool her targets and, in some cases, even their parents.  On Friday, London's Metropolitan Police announced that Watts had been sentenced to eight years behind bars for incidents involving four girls. She pleaded guilty to seven sexual assault and grooming charges in a crime that Judge Susan Evans said caused "severe psychological harm" to victims.  "Their age, as you plainly knew, made it more likely that they would be sexually naive, enabling you to get away with your deception," Evans said during sentencing, according to the Independent.  In what police described as "a bizarre and elaborate web of deception," Watts created profiles for "Jake Waton" on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and other platforms. She shared skateboarding videos, used teenage slang and claimed to work as a cashier at Hollister, a clothing store popular among teens. In photos, she gazed out from beneath a baseball cap or hoodie.  Posing as Waton, Watts liked photos shared by teenage girls and struck up relationships with them, calling them "babe" and other pet names in messages. She built their trust online and through phone calls, police said, before arranging to meet. She traveled across the U.K. to see them.  Authorities said they began investigating in April 2018, after a 14-year-old girl reported being sexually assaulted by her boyfriend, whom she identified as Jake Waton. Police discovered Watts' true identity and two...</description>
