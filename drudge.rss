      <title>BALZ: For Dems, and for Republicans, a summer of discontent...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/For-Democrats-and-for-Republicans-a-summer-of-14278190.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has been a rough week for Republicans and for Democrats. As the long August recess begins, these are not happy times for either political party.  The Democratic presidential candidates put on two nights of debating in Detroit, producing maximum internal bickering and negativity and minimal positive or outward messaging to voters who will decide the 2020 election.  On the first night, the ideological split within the party broke wide open. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the two most left-leaning candidates on the stage, dominated their less-liberal rivals.  On the second night, the Democrats turned on one another, rather than President Donald Trump, and did so in smaller and less substantive ways than their colleagues on night one. Former Vice President Joe Biden bore the brunt of the attacks, though he was not alone. In the process, even former President Barack Obama took it on the chin at times.  Tuesday's session sparked a useful debate about what a post-Obama party should stand for and look like to attract as many voters as possible. But it raised obvious concerns about whether Democrats are veering too far to the left to win a general election against Trump. Wednesday session somehow managed to diminish virtually everyone onstage but didn't much change the nomination contest.  But presidential candidates aren't the only Democrats who are squabbling with one another. House Democrats, who should still be flush with the victory they engineered in the midterm election last November, are split down the middle over the biggest issue before them.  Should they start an impeachment inquiry against the president, as half their caucus now favors? Or, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., prefers, should they hold back indefinitely, or at least until they have more public support and more grounds...</description>
