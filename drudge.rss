      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her opening statement at the Democratic primary debate Thursday night, 2020 candidate for president Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said she is the candidate for people who feel "stuck in the middle of the extremes" of politics. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS: Senator Klobuchar?  SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT: Good evening, Texas Southern. I believe that what unites us up here, the 10 of us, is much stronger than what divides us. And I think that's true of our country, too.  Now, I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we've already got that in the White House.  (APPLAUSE) Houston, we have a problem. This -- we have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show. He would rather lie than lead. I think we need something different.  I am someone that tells the truth. I don't make promises that I can't keep. I have people's back. And I believe that to win, you bring people with you and that is how you govern, as well.  So, you're going to hear a lot of ideas up here. Some will be great. But if you see that some of them seem a little off-track, I've got a better way. If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you've got a home with me, because I don't want to be the president for half of America. I want to be the president for all of America.</description>

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/864643/biden-shrugs-heathcare-costs-when-sanders-brings-canada-america</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary debates offer an important opportunity to shake out the differences between candidates with similar ideologies, a service that is all the more necessary when there are twenty of them running. The beginning of Thursday night's Democratic debate involved plenty of that sort of elbow-throwing as the candidates tried to make space for their own plans to address the question of health care in America, and things got particularly spicy between two of the front runners: former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden had been on the defense against Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) over his support of ObamaCare, which the senators had argued left too many people uninsured. "I think â€” I know that [Warren] says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack," Biden had said early in the night. "I think the ObamaCare worked." But Sanders fiercely pushed back on that statement. "Now let's be clear, Joe," Sanders said. "We are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on Earth." "This is America," said Biden. "Yeah, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries," Sanders shot back. "And [other countries] guarantee health care to all people ... What people want is cost-effective health care." Watch the prickly exchange below. Jeva Lange  Bernie Sanders: "We are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth."Joe Biden: "This is America.""Yeah, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries." https://t.co/INdRXlIwFs #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/hrYzxLgXiC â€” ABC News (@ABC) September 13, 2019</description>
