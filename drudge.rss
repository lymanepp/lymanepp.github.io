      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARADISE, Calif. (AP) — A fast-moving wildfire that ravaged a Northern California town Thursday sent residents racing to escape on roads that turned into tunnels of fire as thick smoke darkened the daytime sky. Several thousand buildings were destroyed by flames, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection official said. "We were surrounded by fire, we were driving through fire on each side of the road," said police officer Mark Bass, who lives in the hard-hit town of Paradise, where harrowing tales of escape and heroic rescues emerged after the entire community of 27,000 was ordered to evacuate.</description>

"Our rent in L.A. was $1,500 for a tiny, 650-square-foot apartment with no amenities," says Brown, 29, a native New Yorker, actress and New York University graduate. She and Shuman, a 28-year-old musician, began looking at Austin, Detroit, Portland, Oregon, and Columbus, Ohio, before settling on Atlanta. "There's a great arts community here [in Atlanta], and it's a growing city with lots of entrepreneurs," said Brown, who is now working several jobs and plans to open a business.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on California wildfires (all times local): 6:45 p.m. Many people who fled a Northern California town to escape a wildfire say they don't know whether their homes survived. The police chief in the town of Paradise, Eric Reinbold, was in that group. Reinbold said Thursday he lives in the middle of town and doesn't know if his house is standing. The town of about 27,000 people 180 miles (290 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco was evacuated. An Associated Press photographer found businesses and homes leveled or in flames, including a liquor store and gas station. A California fire official says he has reports of several hundred structures that have been destroyed, but officials say they won't have an exact count until they can get into the area.</description>

She also denounces Trump's "birther" campaign questioning her husband's citizenship, calling it bigoted and dangerous, "deliberately meant to stir up the wingnuts and kooks."</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.miaminewtimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look, the Broward County Supervisor of Elections Office sucks.

Oft-embattled Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes says she has no idea how many provisional and absentee ballots are left to be counted in her office.</description>
