      <title>Alarm at impending all-white debate... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Some-Democrats-alarmed-at-impending-all-white-14966547.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only white candidates have qualified for next week's Democratic presidential debate, the first time in this election cycle that no minority contender will make the stage. It's a dynamic that critics say threatens to undercut the party's rhetoric of inclusivity.  The race for the 2020 Democratic nomination kicked off last year with a historically diverse pool of candidates, including two black senators, a black mayor, a Hispanic former Cabinet secretary and an Asian businessman. Since then, all have either dropped out or failed to qualify for a spot on the stage, determined by poll numbers and donations.  Now the specter of an all-white debate in the mostly white state of Iowa is prompting concern among party activists.  "Both the way the primary is set up and the way debates are done are a problem," said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, a racial justice organization. "The system they have designed has suppressed the most loyal base of the Democratic Party."  He added: "Anyone with an understanding of civil rights law understands how the rules can be set up to benefit some communities. The Democratic Party should look at the impact of these rules and question the results."  The Democratic Party has held six debates so far, with the seventh scheduled for Tuesday. The party will host at least five additional debates in 2020.  Candidates qualify based on public polling and the number of small donors they attract. Over time, those standards have risen, winnowing the field.  For Tuesday's debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, candidates must show contributions from 225,000 unique donors and reach 7 percent support in two polls of early states, or 5 percent in at least four polls of early states and national surveys.  The latest survey, released...</description>

      <title>DOJ says neo-Nazi group used 'swatting' to target officials, journalists, church...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/DOJ-says-neo-Nazi-group-used-swatting-to-target-14966606.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Federal officials said a Virginia man arrested Friday is linked to a string of fake bomb threats and "swatting" attacks on journalists, government officials and others as part of an international group sympathetic to neo-Nazi ideology.  John William Kirby Kelley had his first appearance in federal court in Alexandria on Friday; his public defender did not comment on the allegations but said his client has "very limited funds." The charge against Kelley of conspiracy to make threats carries up to five years in prison.  Members of the group, which is unnamed, "all appeared to share racist views," according to an affidavit from an FBI agent, "with particular disdain for African Americans and Jewish people." They expressed affinity with the neo-Nazi Atomwaffen Division, the agent wrote.  The investigation began in November 2018, when Old Dominion University in Norfolk got a call claiming someone armed with an AR-15 had hidden pipe bombs around campus. The police got a call a couple hours later from someone with a similar voice who said he had dialed accidentally and apologized. That call came from Kelley's number, listed in school records, according to the affidavit. Authorities said in the documents that Kelley was studying cybersecurity at the school until January, when he was expelled after facing state drug charges.  In chat logs among group members later accessed by law enforcement, the affidavit states, Kelley appeared to suggest the college as a target so he would not have to go to class.  "DON'T BOMB THREAT YOUR OWN SCHOOL," another member later responded after Kelley had been interviewed by campus police.  Authorities said the Old Dominion University incident was linked to a November 2018 bomb threat at the historic and predominantly African American Alfred Street Baptist Church in Old Town Alexandria, which led to...</description>
