      <title>After Falwell departure, LIBERTY U faces questions about faith, power, accountability...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/After-Jerry-Falwell-Jr-s-departure-Liberty-15524296.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liberty University students watched their first all-school convocation of the semester one day after their high-profile president, Jerry Falwell Jr., resigned amid personal scandals.  Falwell has been "an inspiration," said Jerry Prevo, a powerful, fundamentalist pastor from Alaska serving as acting president. He told students that Liberty's leaders are committed to the spiritual mission of the university. He also said Falwell had been the "builder of this great campus, which all of us can be proud of."  Then Jonathan Falwell, pastor of the Liberty-affiliated Thomas Road Baptist Church, spoke. He did not mention his brother by name. But he told his audience, in Lynchburg, Va., and around the globe: "So many times we see Christians that are more focused on building their own brand than they are about building the kingdom of God."  There are a lot of universities out there, Jonathan Falwell said, but Liberty is different: It was built to change the world with the gospel. He urged students to be faithful, trust God and avoid temptation.  Some students who heard the two men said the convocation highlighted a key tension at their school. They felt that Prevo was elevating the former president because of his transformation of the university and that Jonathan Falwell was elevating the Christian values they shared.  "I thought Jonathan Falwell, without being too explicit about it . . . he definitely kind of took Jerry to task," said Eli Best, a junior from Alexandria, Va. "But he did it in a way that took us all to task. It was very relevant."  Fallwell Jr.'s departure leaves Liberty at a turning point: Will the school continue its huge success as measured by the school's size, assets and political clout? Or will it return to the more rigorously religious priority of its revered...</description>

      <title>Cost-cutting uncertainty mires Postal Service in more delays...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Cost-cutting-uncertainty-mires-Postal-Service-in-15524127.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Confusion over Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's planned cost-cutting changes has gripped the nation's mail service and threatened to bring even more delivery delays, say postal workers and union officials.  Days after DeJoy testified before Senate and House committees, vowing to prioritize election mail, postal workers disputed his assertions that pandemic-related challenges were to blame for widespread mail slowdowns. They say the holdups are tied to the postal leader's crackdown - since partially suspended - on overtime and other operational changes, as well as the lack of clarity about which of his proposals will ultimately stick.  In Philadelphia, some letter carriers have gone two weeks without a day off, said one postal worker who, like 11 others interviewed for this piece, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fears of reprisal from their superiors. Processing facilities in other parts of Pennsylvania - Scranton, Harrisburg, Lancaster, the Lehigh Valley - have week-long package backlogs. In Florida, some workers are being instructed not to log mail that arrives after carriers have left on their routes, an anathema to long-serving agency employees.  In the Great Lakes region, which includes parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri, managers are unsure whether DeJoy's realignment of the agency will continue, further slowing the daily movement of hundreds of millions of mail items.  "Everyone's clueless," said one region mid-level manager.  In other areas, including California, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin, postal workers say previous delays have been resolved, but employees are bracing for the election and holiday season, and additional changes DeJoy could institute after the Nov. 3 vote. The plans under consideration, described by four people familiar with Postal Service...</description>

      <title>As Trump appointees flout Hatch Act, civil servants who get caught get punished...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/To-punished-workers-Hatch-Act-not-a-joke-15523350.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A Defense Logistics Agency employee was suspended for 30 days without pay last fall after giving his office colleagues a PowerPoint presentation that displayed the words, "Vote Republican."  An Energy Department worker was forced to resign in January after admitting she gave a woman running for Congress a tour of a federal waste treatment plant so the candidate could show her expertise to potential voters.  Another civil servant began a 120-day suspension without pay from the Food and Drug Administration in July after creating a Facebook page with his name and photograph to solicit political donations and then co-hosting a fundraiser.  These were some of the recent consequences for federal workers who illegally mixed government employment with partisan politics in violation of the Hatch Act, the anti-corruption law Congress passed in 1939.  The New Deal-era law applies, on paper at least, to civil servants and political appointees alike. But the top Trump administration officials showcased in prime-time appearances and speaking slots at the Republican National Convention this week serve as a reminder that when it comes to flouting the separation between governing and politicking, there appears to be a two-tiered system of consequences.  Watchdog groups complained that acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo violated the Hatch Act this week when Wolf led a taped naturalization ceremony for newly minted citizens on White House grounds and Pompeo gave a speech from Israel.  "Convention events were planned and executed by the Trump Campaign and RNC," White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. "Any government employees who participated did so in their personal capacities and in compliance with the Hatch Act."  The...</description>

      <title>CASE NUMBERS RISE AGAIN IN EUROPE </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Case-numbers-rise-again-in-Europe-15522078.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coronavirus cases are surging again in Europe after months of relative calm, but the second wave looks different from the first: Fewer people are dying, and the newest and mostly younger victims of the pandemic need less medical treatment.  Unlike the initial hit of the pandemic this spring, which overwhelmed hospitals and turned nursing homes into grim mortuaries, the European resurgence of recent weeks has not forced as many people into medical wards.  But the increase is widespread, and it is unsettling societies that had hoped the worst was behind them. Paris on Friday joined some other French jurisdictions in imposing a citywide mask requirement, with cases spiking. France, Germany, Spain and others posted caseloads in recent days that had not been seen since April and early May. Spain has been hit particularly hard, with per capita cases now worse than in the United States - a notable marker in Europe, which after the initial springtime spike had generally controlled the virus more successfully than America.  And with almost every European country planning a return to in-person schooling, many starting next week, public health officials are holding their breath for the impact.  The surge is a first test of the efforts Europe has made to improve its resilience in the half-year since the pandemic unleashed a wave of suffering across the world. Most European countries have improved their testing capacity. They have hired contact tracers to combat big outbreaks. They have masks and gloves for their doctors and nurses.  Many countries, including Italy, endured grinding lockdowns this spring. Now citizens are exhausted, and economies are still flagging.  "I don't think the country can survive another lockdown. And to be frank, there is no reason to," said Ranieri Guerra, a World Health Organization assistant director...</description>

      <title>APPLE makes 'privacy' change, and advertising companies cry foul... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Apple-makes-a-privacy-change-and-Facebook-and-15522035.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the coming weeks, Apple plans to change its iPhone software to make it more difficult for advertisers to track Apple customers, an effort that will help further one of the company's long-standing goals: Protecting the privacy of its customers.  But with Apple under the antitrust spotlight, its privacy move has also been called a power move by an advertising industry that is scrambling to adjust to the changes, expected to be included in iOS 14, the company's latest mobile operating system expected to go live next month.  On Wednesday, Facebook became the latest organization to speak openly about the changes, telling investors and users that Apple's move will hurt the social network's bottom line because it will limit the kind of personalized targeting that makes Facebook's ads so valuable to advertisers. "This is not a change we want to make, but unfortunately Apple's updates to iOS14 have forced this decision," the company said in a blog post.  Some in the advertising industry see the moves as part privacy, part self-interest on the part of Apple. Apple also offers advertising, and by limiting the amount of data outside marketers collect, Apple's access to the data becomes more valuable.  "I think there's probably 30 percent truth in that they're doing it for privacy reasons and it's 70 percent that they're doing it because it's what's good for Apple," said Nick Jordan, founder of Narrative I/O, which helps companies gather data for advertising. "It's a question for regulators and courts whether they should be able to wield the power they do over this ecosystem," he said. "They created it, but can they rule it with an iron fist?"  In an interview with The Washington Post, Apple director of privacy engineering Erik Neuenschwander said the changes were part of Apple's privacy road map. When asked whether Apple...</description>
