      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/902272/trump-says-doesnt-take-responsibility-all-lack-coronavirus-testing</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump clearly doesn't mind shaking hands in the age of coronavirus, and he's making sure he flexes his finger-pointing muscles as well. After attacking former President Barack Obama and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for contributing to COVID-19 coronavirus testing failures, Trump emphasized that he, the current U.S. president, bears no responsibility for the disastrous lag in testing kits being distributed across the country. 'No, I don't take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time,' Trump said during a press conference discussing the pandemic. 'It wasn't meant for this kind of an event, with the kind of numbers that we're talking about. What we've done is redesign it very quickly.' Q: Dr. Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was, in fact, a failing. Do you take responsibility for that? President Trump: 'I don't take responsibility at all â€¦ It wasn't meant for this kind of an event' https://t.co/saigTlZ9Rd pic.twitter.com/qayoALD9dd â€” CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) March 13, 2020 As few as 77 kits were administered between Sunday and Wednesday, prompting Dr. Anthony Fauci to call the botched response 'a failing.' During the press conference, both Trump and Fauci iterated that the current testing system was not designed for the specific needs of the new coronavirus crisis. When prompted later by PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor over the Trump administration's 2018 shutdown of a pandemic response team, Trump responded by calling the question 'nasty,' saying he didn't 'know anything' about the disbanding she spoke of. My Q: You said you don't take responsibility for slow response to coronavirus but your administration disbanded the White House office on pandemics? President Trump: 'That's a nasty question...When you say me, I didn't do it. We have a group of people [in the administration].' â€” Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) March 13, 2020 Trump didn't give exact details on when better testing will be rolled out, but he said to expect an announcement Sunday night and claimed they'll have the 'ability to do in the millions over a very quick period of time.'

      <title>Young Americans say billionaires do more harm than good, study shows...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Young-Americans-say-billionaires-do-more-harm-15128596.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a time of near-record wealth concentration, more than twice as many young Americans say the existence of billionaires is bad for society as those who say it is good.  According to the Pew Research Center, 39% of adults younger than 30 support the view that people whose personal fortunes exceed $1 billion "is a bad thing," while 16% say billionaires are good for society.  It's worth noting, however, that a plurality of young Americans - 45% - profess indifference either way.  These attitudes were likely sharpened by the Democratic presidential campaign, which at one point pitted a multibillionaire (Mike Bloomberg) against a socialist senator who says that billionaires shouldn't exist (Bernie Sanders) for the right to challenge the billionaire in the White House come November.  "The recent reigning conventional wisdom over the last several decades of what I call the 'Age of Capital' is that [billionaires] are 'up there' because they are smarter than us," said Anand Giridharadas, author of "Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World." But the Pew data, he says, suggest that young Americans are concluding that billionaires have amassed their wealth "through their rigging of the tax code, through legal political bribery, through their tax avoidance in shelters like the Cayman Islands, and through lobbying for public policy that benefits them privately."  The financial situation of young Americans also explains some of their suspicions toward the ultra-wealthy. In 2016, the median household headed by a person younger than 35 had a net worth of about $11,000, which is lower, in real terms, than the net worth of a comparable younger generation in the 1980s. Those smaller nest eggs are due, in part, to things like massive student loan debt owed to the people and institutions at the opposite end of the financial...</description>
