      <title>Disaster after disaster... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Puerto-Rico-earthquake-aftershocks-again-rattle-14968144.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;GUÁNICA, Puerto Rico - Puerto Rico has not stopped shaking since a 6.4-magnitude earthquake on Tuesday forced thousands of families to sleep outside, jeopardized the territory's weak power infrastructure and frayed the nerves of residents who have endured more than two years of catastrophe after catastrophe.  Unceasing seismic activity on a fault just off the southern coast has pushed damage estimates to $110 million, and municipal authorities are weighing evacuation orders for residents in pueblos such as Guánica, where another 6-magnitude aftershock Saturday rocked the region and threatened to topple anything that hasn't already collapsed.  Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced said Saturday that she had signed a request for a "major disaster declaration" that requires approval from the White House, a move that would release more resources for the power grid, building inspectors and individual assistance. The island is still waiting on more than $18 billion in federal funding after Hurricane Maria devastated much of the island in 2017.  Saturday's strong aftershock also worried residents along the island's southwest coast that the event might not be close to its end, as officials warned additional aftershocks could pose serious risks. Municipal authorities blame the earthquakes for at least three direct or indirect deaths, though the governor has confirmed just one death from the dozens of temblors, a Ponce man who was crushed by a falling wall in his home.  Garced said the powerful aftershocks are expected to lessen over time.  "This kind of thing is not predictable, but what is happening is what we expected," Garced said of the aftershocks on Saturday. "This was not a surprise."  Public schools will not reopen until another round of inspections take place, and there are an estimated 8,000 people in shelters, camps or refuges....</description>
