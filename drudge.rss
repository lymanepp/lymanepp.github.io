      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Trump-retweets-conspiracy-post-tying-Clintons-to-14295776.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BRIDGEWATER, N.J. - President Donald Trump used his Twitter account Saturday to spread an evidence-free conspiracy theory about the death of Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy and politically connected financier who had been facing multiple charges of sex trafficking involving underage girls.  Trump's own Justice Department announced that Epstein, who was being held in a federal corrections facility, died by "apparent suicide."  But Trump appeared to disregard the statements from within his administration, instead retweeting a message from conservative actor and comedian Terrence Williams, who suggested that Epstein's death might be tied to former president Bill Clinton. Williams also questioned how Epstein could have died by suicide if he had been on suicide watch.  The claim is completely unsubstantiated, and federal officials say Epstein was not on suicide watch at the time of his death. He had been placed on suicide watch last month but then taken off within a week, according to a person familiar with the matter.  White House officials did not immediately return a request for a comment on why Trump was spreading the conspiracy theory. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the president's retweet.  A Clinton spokesman responded on Twitter: "Ridiculous, and of course not true - and Donald Trump knows it. Has he triggered the 25th Amendment yet?"  On Saturday, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., warned against embracing conspiracy theories.  While scrutiny of Epstein's apparent suicide is "warranted," Rubio said, he added: "the immediate rush to spread conspiracy theories about someone on the 'other side' of partisan divide having him killed illustrates why our society is so vulnerable to foreign disinformation &amp; influence efforts."  Still, Trump's retweet will surely...</description>
