      <title>For millions, no church on Sunday is cruelest closure so far...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/For-millions-of-Americans-no-church-on-Sunday-is-15131148.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before Friday, Devra Torres saw some houses of worship around the country being shuttered for fear of spreading the coronavirus and considered it "extreme." People shouldn't be "left alone" without Communion or confession, said Torres, who has gone to Mass every day for decades.  Then came news Thursday that the Archdiocese of Washington was calling for parishes to be closed as well, including St. Mark's, to which the 55-year-old freelance editor walks each day at noon to worship.  And then came Friday, Torres' final Mass - at least for now.  "I feel sad. It may seem fanatical to some, but for me this is a very special time of connection with God every day," Torres, who went Friday morning with her 11-year-old son, said of the closures that right now are scheduled through March 27. Catholics, she noted, "believe Jesus is literally present in Communion. You can't get that on TV."  Fear of the contagion this week had religious leaders first altering, and then quickly canceling, access to rituals that for millions are sustenance that can feel as basic as food or water.  Houses of worship closing until further noticemeans empty confession booths. No Communion. No synagogue minyan, the 10-person quorum required by Judaism to pray certain key prayers, including the one mourners say for the dead. And for many who are less orthodox, the absence of a time they set aside in a place that to them feels holy.  "It really is a sense of deprivation," said Sarah Bartel, 42, who lives with her husband and five children outside Seattle, where the Catholic archbishop was the first in the country Wednesday to suspend all public Masses. Washington, D.C., came soon after, on Thursday. Bartel usually attends three times a week. "We believe that Jesus's life, death and resurrection are in the mystery of the Mass - it's at the heart of our...</description>

      <title>PRESIDENT: 'I don't take responsibility at all' over FAILURES...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/902272/trump-says-doesnt-take-responsibility-all-lack-coronavirus-testing</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump clearly doesn't mind shaking hands in the age of coronavirus, and he's making sure he flexes his finger-pointing muscles as well. After attacking former President Barack Obama and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for contributing to COVID-19 coronavirus testing failures, Trump emphasized that he, the current U.S. president, bears no responsibility for the disastrous lag in testing kits being distributed across the country. 'No, I don't take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time,' Trump said during a press conference discussing the pandemic. 'It wasn't meant for this kind of an event, with the kind of numbers that we're talking about. What we've done is redesign it very quickly.' Q: Dr. Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was, in fact, a failing. Do you take responsibility for that? President Trump: 'I don't take responsibility at all â€¦ It wasn't meant for this kind of an event' https://t.co/saigTlZ9Rd pic.twitter.com/qayoALD9dd â€” CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) March 13, 2020 As few as 77 kits were administered between Sunday and Wednesday, prompting Dr. Anthony Fauci to call the botched response 'a failing.' During the press conference, both Trump and Fauci iterated that the current testing system was not designed for the specific needs of the new coronavirus crisis. When prompted later by PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor over the Trump administration's 2018 shutdown of a pandemic response team, Trump responded by calling the question 'nasty,' saying he didn't 'know anything' about the disbanding she spoke of. My Q: You said you don't take responsibility for slow response to coronavirus but your administration disbanded the White House office on pandemics? President Trump: 'That's a nasty question...When you say me, I didn't do it. We have a group of people [in the administration].' â€” Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) March 13, 2020 Trump didn't give exact details on when better testing will be rolled out, but he said to expect an announcement Sunday night and claimed they'll have the 'ability to do in the millions over a very quick period of time.'
