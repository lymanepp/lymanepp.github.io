      <title>The political theater of McEnany's scripted walk-offs...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/The-political-theater-of-Kayleigh-McEnany-s-15384519.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kayleigh McEnany's press briefings don't just draw to a close. They tend to end with a flourish - a true walk-off moment.  It happened again at the White House on Monday. President Donald Trump's press secretary was speaking to reporters when one asked about his denial of reports that Russian operatives offered bounties to Taliban members who kill American troops in Afghanistan. But, a reporter noted, Trump had also claimed that he had never been briefed on the subject - so how could he be certain there were never any bounties?  McEnany was ready for this one.  Quickly flipping pages in her briefing binder, McEnany launched into an extended critique of the New York Times, which broke the Russia story last week. Reading from her notes, she rattled off a series of alleged errors published by the Times in its reporting about Russia over the past four years, including a claim that 17 intelligence agencies had agreed about Russian interference in the 2016 election. (Only four agencies had done so.)  Then she unleashed the uppercut punch: "It is inexcusable, the failed Russia reporting of the New York Times. And I think it's time that the New York Times, and also The Washington Post, hand back their Pulitzers."  Bam!  And with that, McEnany snapped her binder shut and strode out of the briefing room, trailed by the unanswered shouts and murmurs of the White House press corps.  Such dramatic exits have become a signature of McEnany's brief tenure as press secretary. Since taking the job in April, the former Trump-friendly CNN pundit and spokeswoman for Trump's reelection campaign has often waited until the briefing's conclusion - that is, the moment when she determines the briefing is concluded - to unload on the assembled reporters.  The excoriation is typically punctuated by a...</description>

      <title>Risk of catching has started to 'frazzle' Secret Service...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/923672/risk-catching-coronavirus-started-frazzle-some-secret-service-agents</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence continue to host events in areas hard-hit by the coronavirus crisis, the Secret Service agents assigned to look after them are starting to fear for their own health and safety, The Washington Post reports. 'The heightened risk of agents getting sick' while preparing for rallies in states like Arizona and Oklahoma 'has begun to frazzle agents and their families,' the Post reports, citing people close to agents. Their worries aren't unfounded: The Post says Pence was forced to duck out of a 'Faith in America' campaign rally scheduled for Tuesday in Arizona after some of his Secret Service agents displayed coronavirus symptoms and at least one tested positive. Pence postponed his visit until Wednesday so that new, healthy agents could be brought in. This is the second time recently that Secret Service agents have contracted the virus while prepping for an event for the administration. Two agents tested positive before Trump's controversial rally in Tulsa on June 20, and at least eight campaign staff members who helped plan the event have also tested positive. Catherine Milhoan, the director of communications for the Secret Service, told The New York Times that 'the health and safety of our work force, their families, and that of our protectees remains the agency's highest priority.'

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time in two months, Tokyo reached triple digits in new coronavirus cases in a single day when it exceeded 100 on Thursday. The surge extended Friday, with the figure reaching 124. Particularly noticeable have been the spread of infections in nightspots and among young people.  The Tokyo metropolitan government remains confident that the medical system has enough capacity to handle the surge, but is becoming increasingly wary about the spread of the virus.  Centered on bustling areas  "We can't rule out the possibility of a rapid increase in new cases from now. We need to exercise more vigilance," Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said at a hastily called press conference Thursday evening, expressing a sense of urgency.  Recently in Tokyo, infections have increased especially among those involved in the night entertainment industry, including workers at host clubs and hostess bars and their customers.  Of those who tested positive for the virus over the seven days through Thursday, about 40% are related to "nightspots." Of those, bustling areas such as Shinjuku and Ikebukuro stand out in particular. There have also been confirmed coronavirus cases at a maid cafe in the Akihabara district.  Another characteristic is that more and more young people in their 20s and 30s are contracting the virus. In April, these age groups accounted for 36% of all people infected, but in the week through Thursday, the percentage doubled to about 70%.  There are many cases of the virus spreading at gatherings or parties in izakaya Japanese pubs. "Young people often show no symptoms, and they participate in a wide range of activities," a senior metropolitan government official said. "There is the fear that they are infecting others without knowing it."  Situation 'different' from April . ..</description>
