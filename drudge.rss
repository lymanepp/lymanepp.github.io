      <title>Dems face added pressure on racial issues... </title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/After-debate-Democrats-face-added-pressure-on-14065391.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - An impassioned argument over racism in America has boiled to the surface in an increasingly muddled Democratic presidential primary campaign, triggered by an electrifying debate encounter that has reverberated across the campaign for days.  Former vice president Joe Biden, who since his April 25 entry into the presidential contest has held a consistent lead in polls, is experiencing the most unsteady period of his campaign so far in the aftermath of his heated exchange with Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., over his past views on school desegregation, with demands from some civil rights leaders for him to further clarify his 1970s-era opposition to mandatory busing.  The moment has taken on particular salience because it showcased Biden, 76, who has premised his candidacy in part on his ability to win back working-class white voters, under attack from one of the country's most prominent black political figures in Harris, who addressed the issues in deeply personal terms.  Harris and a second black presidential candidate, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., have spent the past week casting Biden as an anachronism who should apologize for his busing position and his willingness to work with segregationist senators.  The rising tensions have the potential to reshape the race, with Biden at risk of losing support from crucial African American voters and Harris appearing to gain momentum. But the emerging dynamics are also sparking concern among some in the party who fear that renewing painful debates over school busing risks turning off centrist voters whom Democrats hope to win next year in their shared goal of defeating President Trump.  "There is a narrow pathway if we continue on this path of being the quote-unquote Whole Foods party," said J.D. Scholten, the Democrat who nearly defeated Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, in a...</description>

      <title>PAPER:  Trump's hard line approach softens in meetings with world leaders... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-s-hard-line-approach-appears-to-soften-in-14065230.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump entered his meeting with President Xi Jinping over the weekend promising to take a tough approach on trade negotiations and pressure his Chinese counterpart into a sweeping deal.  But the meeting did not produce an agreement - and Trump's stance seemed to only soften as he announced he was relaxing limits on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei and delaying new tariffs on Chinese goods in hopes of restarting trade talks with Beijing.  "We discussed a lot of things and we're right back on track," Trump said. "We'll see what happens."  Trump's meetings with Xi and other leaders at the Group of 20 economic summit suggest that despite his promise to use negotiating savvy and personal relationships to extract concessions from rivals or uncooperative allies, he often leaves one-on-one sessions with fellow world leaders without firm agreements in hand.  Trump emerged from his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin with no specific public commitments, although both nations had pledged in principle beforehand to explore a new arms control pact. Despite concerns over Turkey's plan to purchase Russian defense systems, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Trump told him the United States would not punish his government with sanctions over the decision.  And while his meeting with Kim Jong Un following the G-20 appeared to provide the North Korean dictator with a propaganda victory to tout back home, Trump did not publicly secure more than a commitment to resume nuclear talks that have so far yielded no breakthroughs.  "In the case of Putin, Erdogan, and others, I don't see him pushing that hard. He pushes harder with allies than with adversaries," said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. "In some cases, even with North Korea or Iran, it's not clear...</description>
