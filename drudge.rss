      <title> ICE has run facial-recognition searches on millions of Maryland drivers...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/ICE-has-run-facial-recognition-searches-on-15087173.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been permitted to run facial-recognition searches on millions of Maryland driver's license photos without first seeking state or court approval, state officials said - access that goes far beyond what other states allow and that alarms immigration activists in a state that grants special driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.  More than 275,000 such licenses have been issued statewide since 2013, when the state became the first on the East Coast to defy federal guidelines and allow undocumented immigrants to obtain a license without having to provide proof of legal status. The technology now under scrutiny could let an ICE official run a photograph of an unknown person through the system and see whether potentially undocumented immigrants are flagged as a match.  "It's a betrayal of immigrants' trust for the [state] to turn around and let ICE run warrantless searches on their faces," said Harrison Rudolph, a senior associate at the Georgetown University law school's Center on Privacy and Technology. "It's a bait-and-switch. . . . ICE is using biometric information in the shadows, without government notice or public approval, to hunt down the most vulnerable people."  A top Maryland law enforcement official told state lawmakers in November that ICE officials had logged nearly 100 sessions in the state's driver's license database since 2018, according to a previously unpublicized letter obtained by The Washington Post. Each session could have included multiple searches of the Maryland Image Repository System database, which includes the photos, names, addresses and other personal information of roughly 7 million drivers statewide.  The battle to grant driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants spanned more than a decade in Maryland and is viewed by...</description>

      <title>Israel first country to warn citizens not to travel...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/898497/israel-first-country-warn-citizens-not-travel-abroad-over-coronavirus-fears</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Israel on Wednesday became the first country to officially warn its citizens to avoid any international travel amid fears over the coronavirus outbreak. Several airlines have canceled flights to China, where the respiratory virus originated, and governments have issued warnings about travel to certain countries, but no country has actively urged their citizens avoid traveling abroad at large until now. 'If you don't genuinely have to fly â€” don't do so,' Israel's health ministry said in a statement. Although the majority of cases remain in China, the virus has spread to several other countries. In response to criticism that the country was stoking panic and could cause both economic and diplomatic damage, the health ministry said they'd rather deal with the inconveniences now than be sorry later, The Times of Israel reports. The only confirmed Israeli cases so far involve people who were on a cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan, although South Korea â€” which is experiencing one of the larger outbreaks beyond China â€” reportedly informed Israel over the weekend that a members from a group of pilgrims returned to South Korea from Israel and tested positive for the disease.
