      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The two top-ranking Democrats indicated Tuesday that their confidence is growing that their party will retake the House majority in November's midterm elections, as a new Washington Post-ABC News poll showed voters turning sharply against congressional Republicans. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent a letter telling colleagues on Tuesday that Democrats "must Be Ready for the prospect that we will be in the Majority in January." Pelosi said that the top Democrats on House committees will write bills reflecting the party's "For the People" campaign agenda, with an emphasis on reining in health care coats, raising wages and cleaning up corruption in Washington.</description>
