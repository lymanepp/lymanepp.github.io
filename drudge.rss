      <title>Arizona wildfires grow as flames flicker throughout Desert Southwest...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Arizona-wildfires-grow-as-flames-flicker-15357348.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wildfires continue to rage in Arizona, leading into another week set to feature hot, dry conditions from the Desert Southwest to California. At the same time as the fires are burning, prompting evacuations, spikes in coronavirus cases are being recorded in several states in the region, including Arizona.  The fifth-largest wildfire in Arizona state history continued to rage Monday morning, swelling to 186,086 acres in size. The so-called Bush Fire northeast of Phoenix had torched an area of land seven times larger than Disney World and thirteen times larger than the island of Manhattan. It was 42% contained, with more than 700 personnel working to fight the flames.  State Route 87 was closed from Payson to Bush Highway, spanning 52 miles of the roadway. Routes 188 and 88 also experienced closures as well. And it was just one of a spattering of blazes dotting the region.  Elsewhere, officials were combating a number of other wildfires amid unfavorable weather conditions, with temperatures heating up into the upper 90s or triple digits for some, with little chance for rain. There's likely no immediate end in sight to the dry and hot weather, with Arizona's wildfire season likely to push on through at least mid-July.  California's fire season is barely getting started.  The communities of Sunflower and Apache Lake remained under evacuation notices, where danger was "imminent and life threatening." Other communities initially threatened by the Bush Fire were returned to a "set" level on a "ready, set, go" scale, and several thousand residents were permitted to return to their homes. However, they've been urged to be ready to evacuate with little or no notice.  The evacuations are more complicated this year due to concerns over the coronavirus, as cases of covid-19 continue to grow in the state. Cases are also on the increase...</description>

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/LAX-is-testing-fever-detecting-cameras-as-15357205.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting Tuesday, some travelers at Los Angeles International Airport will be asked to undergo a new screening process long before they get to security checkpoints: walking past cameras that can flag travelers with a fever.  Officials on Monday planned to announce a pilot program to test the use of thermal imaging cameras at the departures entrance and the corridor for international arrivals in the airport's Tom Bradley International Terminal.  "We're trying to do everything we can to make sure that our airport terminals are a safe environment, and we're making sure that we're doing everything we can to make it healthy for people to come in," said Justin Erbacci, chief executive of Los Angeles World Airports.  Signs will direct travelers to walk through an area where cameras are stationed, which detect whether someone has a temperature of 100.4 or higher. Those who show an elevated temperature will be pulled aside for a secondary screening to confirm. Participation will be voluntary, and the airport will not stop anyone from continuing with their journey during the pilot - though workers will give advice handed down from county and federal health officials about traveling with an elevated temperature.  Airlines that are doing their own temperature screening can still prohibit travelers from flying if they have fevers.  "Through this pilot, we are not going to stop anybody from traveling," Erbacci said. "We want to test the accuracy of the technology and to understand if it is really able to capture accurate body temperatures of passengers en masse as they walk through this portal."  Similar technology has been used in airports in Asia since the SARS epidemic; during the coronavirus pandemic, workplaces, foreign airlines, resorts and others have invested in thermal imaging...</description>

      <title>'Office of Hate': Bot Army Target of Brazil's Top Court...</title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/In-hunt-for-office-of-hate-Brazil-s-Supreme-15356841.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's known as the "office of hate." And like all good conspiracies, there's no hard proof it actually exists.  The alleged clandestine network of bots, businessmen and bloggers is said by some lawmakers and Brazil's biggest newspaper to rain vitriol on all who oppose President Jair Bolsonaro -- whether it be a super-star judge who jumps ship, a health minister who won't toe the line on the administration's covid strategy or a journalist who pens a critical article.  Now, the Supreme Court is trying to unmask pro-Bolsonaro social-media attack dogs after saying it found "serious evidence" pointing to the group's existence. The president blasts the effort as an affront to free speech and a political witch-hunt by a deep state cabal. The top court, which took the unusual step of launching its own investigation, alleges the "office of hate" may have weaponized fake news in a coordinated bid to topple opponents, institutions and perhaps even democracy itself.  There are "two or three campaigns every day in real time on every issue," said Marco Aurelio Ruediger, director of the Department of Public Policy Analysis at Getulio Vargas University, known as FGV, in Rio de Janeiro. "It's spontaneous, but also professional."  The Supreme Court investigation set in motion an interstate raid last month of properties linked to a far-right blogger, three high-profile businessmen and a dozen others. The case builds on two more probes already under way: One ordered by the nation's electoral watchdog and another by Congress.  Combined, the probes target the very way Bolsonaro communicates and energizes his base. Rulings against him could not only muzzle the social media machine that helped shoot him to power, but could also be grounds for impeachment.  "All these people were decisive in the construction of Bolsonaro, decisive in the creation...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Democrats in central and Southside Virginia are choosing a nominee for an open congressional seat that the party thinks it could win for the first time in more than a decade.  Republicans last week ousted freshman Rep. Denver Riggleman in favor of Bob Good, who calls himself a "biblical conservative," to the delight of Democrats surveying their field of well-funded hopefuls competing in Tuesday's primary.  "I think everybody sort of breathed a sigh of relief and said, 'Bring it.' Bob Good really does not reflect the view of voters in this district," said Suzanne Long, chairwoman of the 5th District Democratic committee.  Four Democrats are on the ballot in the primary, which is being conducted mostly by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic but also has in-person voting from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday.

      <title>Police say deaths of black people by hanging are suicides. Many aren't so sure...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Police-say-deaths-of-black-people-by-hanging-are-15356603.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The historical seasons have changed, and once again, America's trees are bearing a strange and bitter fruit - dead black bodies.  In less than one month, six black people have been found hanging from trees, in California, Georgia, New York, Oregon and Texas. Authorities say that all of these deaths appear to be suicides, with no signs of foul play. But family members of the deceased, protesters and activists, and some scholars of anti-black violence are intuitively suspicious about those conclusions. Rumors are also swirling on social media that these deaths are lynchings, with Twitter users saying things like: "With sound body and mind, I'm here to tell you right now, if my body is found hanging from a tree, I did NOT commit suicide, I was murdered."  These incidents are happening at a time of nationwide racial upheaval - when people are already on edge and suspicious about police accounts of their encounters with black people. Tree hangings evoke traumatic memories of America's grisly history of unpunished lynchings of thousands of black adults and children between 1880 and 1968.  Black people do commit suicide, of course, though the rate is 60% lower than for whites, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In black American culture, suicide is widely regarded as a shameful act; when it happens, it's generally private, and hanging is not a preferred method.  "It is very uncommon for young black men to commit suicide, let alone by hanging," says Raymond Winbush, a psychologist since 1976 who has treated hundreds of black men and boys and is the director of Morgan State University's Institute for Urban Research. The American Association of Suicidology reports that firearms are the predominant method of suicide among African Americans (as they are for the nation overall), regardless of...</description>

      <title>Behind the scenes of drive-in concert: 'Never been more grateful to be honked at'...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/entertainment/article/Behind-the-scenes-of-a-drive-in-concert-I-ve-15356446.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mike Eli, lead singer of the Eli Young Band, strummed his guitar onstage and gazed into the crowd on a warm Texas evening in June. "How many of you out there are dreamers?" he asked.  He was answered by an explosion of car horns.  "Whatever it is that you dream about," he said, "keep on believing."  This was not exactly how the country band envisioned their 2020 touring experience. As they started singing their Grammy-nominated hit "Even If It Breaks Your Heart," a stirring anthem about following your dreams, they looked out on a parking lot filled with people sitting in their cars as they tuned into the show via an FM radio station, just like a drive-in movie.  Summer tour season is upon us, and Americans are starting to begrudgingly accept that, amid the covid-19 pandemic, large-scale concerts won't resume for a long time. The music industry has been forced to get creative - and besides artists hopping on Instagram for a live stream, the most popular choice for a musical performance might be drive-in concerts.  What was once an unimaginable concept makes a lot of sense in the era of social distancing. But how does it actually work? We talked to music executives, artists and fans at one show in Texas for a snapshot of what it's like to organize, perform and attend a concert in the year 2020.  As acts such as Keith Urban and Los Lobos embark on drive-in shows, each setup is different: Some are in fields, others are on farms. On June 27, Garth Brooks will perform a concert broadcast to 300 drive-in movie theater screens. The Eli Young Band show, part of the "Concert In Your Car" series (some of which we viewed via FaceTime from Washington, because that's how things work now) took place in a parking lot outside Globe Life Field in Arlington where the Texas Rangers play.  The idea started in March, as soon as Triple 8...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Biden-and-Democrats-confidence-comes-with-fear-15355742.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden's campaign and his Democratic Party are feeling an emotion they have not sensed in quite some time, and one that prompts more than a little fear: confidence.  Poll after poll has placed the presumptive Democratic nominee ahead of President Donald Trump, with comfortable national leads that in some cases have swollen to double digits. He is ahead by narrower but consistent margins in battleground states, and Biden himself has grown increasingly bullish on the idea that Democrats will win back the Senate majority, a possibility not even dreamed of until recently. Once an anemic fundraiser, he is now routinely drawing multimillion-dollar hauls.  Trump is presiding over a Depression-style economy, a global pandemic and boiling social unrest. His administration has lost several high-profile Supreme Court cases, his former National Security adviser's new book has painted a damning portrait, and he is now in perhaps the weakest position of his presidency with less than five months before the general election. The images of a half-empty arena for Trump's much-hyped rally in Tulsa, Okla., on Saturday underscored the perception of a diminished incumbent, one who has long seen crowd size as a barometer of success.  But for Democrats, the very idea that they are doing well provokes an underlying skittishness. They worry about voting during the coronavirus crisis, amid restrictions that could make it harder to cast ballots. Some fear a coming misinformation campaign and say the party risks underestimating Trump's ability to turn the country against their nominee.  They also worry their party still does not fully understand what led voters to Trump in the first place, and they are terrified that overconfidence, like some of them had four years ago, will lead to complacency.  "It feels like 2016 all over," said Andrew...</description>

      <title>How virus tore through Latin America's largest market...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/How-coronavirus-tore-through-Latin-America-s-15355707.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MEXICO CITY - Martín Mateo had a cold. Or so he thought: sore throat, body aches, runny nose. "He felt bad but kept working," said his son, Carlos. The 50-year-old father had labored for decades as a tomatero - a tomato man - at Latin America's biggest food market.  Coronavirus? He didn't believe in it.  Then Mateo started gasping for breath. Within days, he was dead.  By then, scores of his fellow tomateros also were infected. Workers hoisted yellow signs outside the market reading "High Contagion Zone." At least 10 tomato men died from mid-April to mid-May. They included Mateo's cousin Antonio, a bookkeeper at a neighboring stall named Guillermo, and a bald man everyone called El Peluche - loosely, "Fuzzy."  The tomato aisle at Mexico City's famed Central de Abasto market offers a glimpse into why the virus has hit the country so hard. It scythed its way through the sprawling complex, picking off workers made vulnerable by poverty-related problems: chronic illnesses, distrust of government, a need to keep earning money.  While there is no official data, vendors can name dozens of people in the vegetable aisles alone who lost their lives - green-bean sellers, chili vendors, potato men - in one of the most brutal outbreaks in the city.  "Here we didn't believe" the coronavirus was a threat, said 57-year-old Anastasio Ramón Alonso, a longtime tomato vendor. "But when people began to die and die and die, we lost our incredulity."  Officials have reported more than 20,000 coronavirus deaths in Mexico, undoubtedly an undercount. The virus appears to have entered the country with the upper class - people returning from business trips in Italy and skiing holidays in Colorado. But it spread quickly to low-income workers, who have been hit particularly hard.  As in the United...</description>

      <title>Trump claims he told officials to slow coronavirus testing to keep case numbers low..</title>
      <link>http://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Trump-says-he-told-officials-to-slow-coronavirus-15355554.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amid surging coronavirus infections nationwide, President Donald Trump said at his campaign rally in Tulsa Saturday night that he told officials to administer fewer coronavirus tests to keep case numbers down.  The comments drew a chorus of criticism from congressional Democrats, who said it validated fears that the president was more focused on saving face amid the pandemic than on protecting public health. A White House official told The Washington Post that Trump was joking, a common defense from Trump's aides when he says something controversial.  Eight states on Saturday reported their highest single-day case counts since the pandemic began, and daily new infections nationwide exceeded 30,000 on both Friday and Saturday. The country has not seen daily totals that high in more than seven weeks.  One of the country's leading public health experts said Sunday that he was worried that Trump's rally in Tulsa could become a "super-spreader" event resulting in many people being infected with the coronavirus.  "We have seen in the past few months around the world that indoor gatherings have been the source of most super-spreading events," Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University, told Fox News, responding to a question about possible contagion at the rally. "There's an opportunity for much more spread in a short period of time, so I am worried about that."  Attendance was reported to be significantly lower than expected, but Inglesby said the rally was still "concerning in terms of public health risks."  He noted that attendees were packed close together, shouting and shaking hands, and that many were not wearing masks. "All of those things will increase the risk of spread," he said.  Host Chris Wallace asked whether there was "some...</description>

      <title>Debacle in Oklahoma...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Analysis-What-empty-seats-in-Tulsa-tell-us-about-15355871.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TULSA, Okla. - The omens started early Saturday morning, before the gates to the "Great American Comeback" rally were opened. I got downtown later than I'd wanted to, making a detour to buy a poncho, after weather forecasts suggested a chance of rain. Shortly after 9 a.m., I started looking for parking, and two Tulsans who were charging $30 for a space politely said I might want to drive around before paying.  "I thought we'd be full by now," one of the sellers said, "based on the news."  One minute later, I found free street parking and began walking to the BOK Center. Eight hours later, President Donald Trump's campaign was dramatically downscaling its first rally since March, striking a stage at an overflow section as a few dozen supporters mingled in a space designed for thousands. The rain never came. Neither did the expected audience.  Saturday's rally in Tulsa was, on the campaign's own terms, a debacle - a meticulously organized and well-protected event that left thousands of seats unfilled in an arena once sold out by Nickelback. The president himself had predicted a "record-setting crowd," tweeting as the number of online ticket requests surged to Coachella proportions - 300,000, 600,000, 1 million.  "We've never had an empty seat, and we certainly won't in Oklahoma," Trump had said.  That hubris overshadowed what might have been landmark event, the first campaign rally of any kind since March and the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The audience was still larger than any Joe Biden had drawn before securing the Democratic nomination. And the hours of programming clarified how Trump would run against Biden - a message that partly relied on massive rallies.  "Would anybody sleep on the ground overnight waiting to see Joe Biden?" asked Lara Trump, a presidential daughter-in-law and key campaign surrogate, as...</description>
