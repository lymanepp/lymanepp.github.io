      <title>People turning to dogs, cats, chickens to cope with self-isolation...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Alone-no-more-People-are-turning-to-dogs-cats-15146418.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a normal Sunday at the PetSmart in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Lucky Dog Animal Rescue would hold an adoption event and find homes for about 15 dogs.  But as coronavirus news started to spread this past week, the waiting list skyrocketed from 10 to 40 would-be adopters. "And we had 30 adoptions in three hours at that event alone," said Mirah Horowitz, the rescue's executive director.  Forget, toilet paper, milk and hand sanitizer: There's now a rush to stock up on real necessities, such as cats and dogs. And rabbits and fish, even a couple of chickens.  As millions of people across the U.S. work from home and schools close, the promise of companionship even in a time of isolation is prompting some to take in animals. Many say they finally have the time to properly train and care for a new pet. Animal rescuers across the country say they are seeing spiking interest in adoption and fostering, as well as offers to help everywhere from open-admission shelters to smaller nonprofit groups.  In California, where 40 million residents were ordered on Thursday night to stay home except for essential jobs or trips, like getting groceries, Gov. Gavin Newsom noted an important exemption.  "You can still walk your dog," he said.  That was part of the appeal for Kathy Shield, a University of Berkeley graduate student. After years of wanting a dog, Shield on Thursday adopted a 2-year-old brown and white dog from the Milo Foundation shelter in Point Richmond, California and named him Atom.  "I'm a nuclear scientist so it's very on brand," said Shield.  The timing was ideal, because Shield is working from home and can help the Atom adjust to his new environment. She's also excited to have someone to talk to, even if he doesn't have much to say back.  Plus, it will help keep her on schedule....</description>

      <title>People moved here to escape big city drama. With coronavirus, that's impossible...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/People-moved-here-to-escape-big-city-drama-With-15147904.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WILLCOX, Ariz. - Several employees wore medical masks and almost all wore plastic gloves, a jarring sight for some customers who appeared visibly taken aback as they entered their local Safeway store.  Even in this small town of roughly 3,500 people, the scene wasn't much different than stores in the big city: aisle after aisle of empty shelves where the toilet paper, hand soap and sanitizer used to be. All the Tylenol was sold out, along with cans of beans, cartons of eggs and all the milk - the nondairy kind, too.  And good luck finding a thermometer. Amid the growing concern over the coronavirus, the stock had been cleaned well over a week ago. At first, the pharmacist sent folks over to the Dollar General, but then she'd heard they were out, too.  "I tried to order them, but they're just gone," she said, apologetically.  Up and down the aisles, people shook their heads at the strange scene in a community distant enough to be spared the drama of places like Tucson or Phoenix. This was the place where people came to escape, a small town surrounded by even smaller ones where social distancing was kind of the point.  But all through town, things felt eerie. Restaurants and businesses that were never closed were dark and empty. The dining room at the McDonald's was closed. As shoppers drove into the Safeway parking lot, they passed a panhandler who waved a sign that simply read, "WTF?"  When a Safeway cashier in a medical mask held up the check-out line to wipe down the register area with disinfectant, tensions boiled over. "I mean, this is crazy!" a man said loudly. He ignored fliers posted at the lanes that urged customers to stay at least two shopping carts away from others in the store, inching uncomfortably close to two women ahead of him in line. "This is just too...</description>

      <title>ECONOMY DETERIORATING FAST</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/U-S-economy-deteriorating-faster-than-15147050.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The U.S. economy is deteriorating more quickly than was expected just days ago, as extraordinary measures designed to curb the coronavirus keep 84 million Americans penned in their homes and cause the near-total shutdown of most businesses.  In a single 24-hour period, the governors of three of the largest states - California, New York and Illinois - ordered residents to stay home, except to buy food and medicine, while the governor of Pennsylvania ordered the closure of nonessential businesses. Across the globe, health officials are struggling to cope with the growing number of patients, with the World Health Organization noting that while it required three months to reach 100,000 cases, it took only 12 days to hit another 100,000.  The resulting economic meltdown, which is sending several million workers streaming into the unemployment line, is outpacing the federal government's efforts to respond. As the Senate on Friday raced to complete work on a financial rescue package, the White House and key lawmakers were dramatically expanding its scope, pushing the legislation far beyond the original $1 trillion price tag.  With each day, an unprecedented stoppage gathers force, as restaurants, movie theaters, sports arenas, and offices close to shield themselves from the disease. Already, it's clear that the initial economic decline will be sharper and more painful than during the 2008 financial crisis.  Next week, roughly 3 million Americans will file first-time claims for unemployment assistance, more than four times the record high set in the depths of the 1982 recession, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That's just the start of a surge that could send the jobless rate spiking to 20 percent from today's 3.5 percent, a JPMorgan Chase economist told clients on a conference call Friday.  Estimates of the...</description>

      <title>Much of life comes to standstill as countries shut themselves off from rest of world... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Much-of-life-comes-to-a-standstill-as-countries-15147058.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;European truck drivers stuck in miles-long backups. Asylum seekers stranded in Mexico. Cities and states within countries - from Rio de Janeiro to Tasmania - sealing themselves off from the rest of their nations.  In a world where the once-steady march of globalization hit strong head winds in recent years from nationalist governments, the novel coronavirus pandemic has done more to suddenly halt and reverse the notion of open - and easily crossed - borders than perhaps any other event in modern history.  The impact to the global economy will be severe. Yet the larger question arising from empty international airports and backed-up land borders may be the long-haul effect of the pandemic on everything from freedom of movement to asylum claims to trade.  "The question is, when the health crisis recedes, be that six months, one year, or two years from now, are we going to see the protectionist measures related to the health crisis recede too?" said Stephanie Segal, a former senior economist at the International Monetary Fund and a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Certainly they will, but will they ever go back to precrisis levels?"  In the meantime, the pandemic is stranding travelers and upending everything from refugee flows to wedding rites.  In South America, still less impacted than other regions, many nations are striving to keep it that way by imposing some of the strictest border controls in the world. Peru and Bolivia have suspended international flights, restricted crossings at land borders, and deployed police and the military on the streets.  As concerns mount about the ability of crisis-plagued Venezuela to control the pandemic, its neighbors have sealed its borders. The closures have raised fears of a bottleneck that could force migrants - as well as...</description>
