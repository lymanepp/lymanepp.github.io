      <description>&lt;b&gt;autos.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Wilson/GettyFormer President Donald Trump, as well as his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., have retained attorney Jesse Binnall to represent each of them in a lawsuit filed by Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-CA), according to a person with knowledge of the matter.Binnall, a Republican attorney based in Virginia, previously represented former Trump national security adviser Mike Flynn, alongside attorney Sidney Powell, after prosecutors charged him with lying to the FBI about his communications with Russia‚Äôs ambassador to the U.S. More recently, Binnall filed a lawsuit in Nevada on behalf of the Trump campaign which sought to overturn President Joe Biden‚Äôs electoral victory there, and he has also repped Defending the Republic, a legal group founded in part by Powell, in a defamation suit filed by Dominion Voting Systems.A Treasure Hunter, a Satanism Expert, and Mike Lindell Fight to Overturn Biden Win in ArizonaTrump Jr. is now the second Trump family member to be represented by Binnall after the attorney signed on to represent former President Trump in a similar lawsuit filed by Democratic Mississippi Congressman Bennie Thompson. Both the Thompson and Swalwell lawsuits allege that Trump and his associates violated the Ku Klux Klan act of 1871 and that Trump‚Äôs rhetoric was part of a deliberate attempt to incite rioters to disrupt Congress‚Äô certification of President Biden‚Äôs victory on Jan. 6.Binnall also represented Trump in a lawsuit filed in November against the then-president, his campaign, and the Republican National Committee. The suit alleged that Trump ‚Äúsought to overturn the result of the election by disenfranchising voters, in particular voters of color‚Äù in part by ‚Äúintimidating election officials and vote tabulators while they counted votes.‚ÄùRead more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Bloomberg) -- It may take days for salvage crew to move the giant container vessel that‚Äôs clogging the Suez Canal out of the way, according to two people familiar with the situation.The vessel, Ever Given, is well and truly stuck in the embankment along the canal, according to two people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing private details. The ship has been jammed length-ways across the canal early Tuesday in Egypt, leaving at least 100 vessels gridlocked.Salvage efforts have been underway, but at least one attempt to re-float the ship was unsuccessful due to the weight of the ship and small size of the tug boats operated by authorities, the people said. A further attempt is re-float the ship is taking place on Wednesday morning local time, and the ship‚Äôs owners are in talks to hire SMIT Salvage B.V. to assist in operations, one of the people said. A spokesperson for SMIT declined to comment.Larger salvage tugs with bigger horsepower may be required to pull the ship -- which has one of the biggest container carrying capacities in the world -- out of the ground, the people said. Images of the stuck vessel showed excavators trying to dig the ship out.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.¬©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</description>

      <title>World Facing Coffee Deficit in Supply Chain 'Nightmare'...</title>
      <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coffee-trade-reeling-virus-faces-180243966.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Coffee supplies in the U.S. are shrinking and wholesale prices are surging, with the hard-hit market bracing for further fallout from a global shortage of shipping containers that‚Äôs upended the food trade.Coffee stockpiles have sunk to a six-year low in the U.S. even with Brazil‚Äôs record crop, and a large drop in output after a drought in the South American country is expected to shift the world balance to a deficit in coming months just as demand rebounds.‚ÄúEverybody is feeling the pinch,‚Äù said Christian Wolthers, the president of Wolthers Douque, an importer in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who estimates that shipping costs have more than doubled from Latin America. ‚ÄúThese bottlenecks are turning into a container nightmare.‚ÄùWhile cargo-market disruptions have played havoc the global food trade generally, the problems in the coffee market show food inflation already on the rise could be exacerbated as economies reopen. For now, roasters are able to draw on inventories rather than raise prices, but with stockpiles sliding and a smaller Brazilian crop coming, the strains are expected to persist.Arabica-coffee futures in New York have risen about 24% since the end of October following the damage to Brazilian groves. In February, American green, unroasted bean inventory slid 8.3% from a year earlier to the smallest since 2015, industry data showed Monday.The lower inventories mean less of a buffer to cushion the expected decline in Brazil‚Äôs crop, aggravating market tightness and lending continued support to prices, analysts say.Marex Spectron this month increased its estimate for a global coffee deficit to 10.7 million bags in 2021-22, compared with its previous projection of 8 million bags, citing lower Brazilian arabica output after adverse weather damaged crops. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report that if production in Central America doesn‚Äôt improve in coming years, the market will enter a structural deficit given the rebound in demand.In the facilities of Dinamo, one of Brazil‚Äôs largest coffee warehouses operators, there‚Äôs a lot of product stuck waiting for containers. In the company‚Äôs unit in Machado municipality, in the coffee heartland of Minas Gerais, beans are awaiting the arrival of 18 empty containers, said Luiz Alberto Azevedo Levy Jr., a director at Dinamo. ‚ÄúThese containers will probably take about 15 more days to get here amid bottlenecks at the port,‚Äù he said.The situation, which got even more dire in March, will probably reduce the volume of coffee exported by Brazil, Levy Jr. said.‚ÄúLogistics have been a headache, dealing with lack of space and containers,‚Äù said Marco Figueiredo, trader and partner at the Florida-based Ally Coffee, a specialty coffee merchant that imports beans from countries including Colombia, Guatemala, and Brazil. ‚ÄúWe are monitoring the situation and talking to clients, making them aware of the rising costs.‚ÄùDenmark‚Äôs A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, the world‚Äôs largest shipping company, said containers and charter vessels are temporarily unavailable for purchase or lease, increasing congestion and bringing delays at ports. The company has tried to purchase or rent all available containers, and is keeping aging units in operation. It‚Äôs also repairing ones that it usually wouldn‚Äôt at higher costs, Maersk said in an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg.‚ÄúThis is a temporary situation, both in terms of purchasing patterns and availability of vessels,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúWe expect things to return to normal during the first half of 2021.‚ÄùFor now, many merchants are trying to hold the line on price increases as they work to lure customers back to cafes and restaurants. There‚Äôs steady growth in coffee, though the out-of-home segment could take two to three years to return to pre-Covid levels, according to David Rennie, head of Nestle SA‚Äôs coffee brands.Stefano Martin, sales and marketing export manager at Italy-based cafe chain Diemme, said the business isn‚Äôt yet feeling the full impact because it‚Äôs still operating under contracts made prior to the shipping disruptions. That could change as those contracts are renewed, he said. The company has 26 restaurants and coffee shops, and typically imports 30,000 bags in around 90 shipping containers from Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Tanzania and India.‚ÄúThere is no impact on our side yet as we have closed all contracts before the prices increased,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut most probably next batch of contracts will be charged to us.‚ÄùFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.¬©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</description>
