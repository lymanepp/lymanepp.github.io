      <title>HOUSTON: ICU beds filled with young people...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/922590/nearly-onethird-icu-coronavirus-patients-houston-hospital-system-are-reportedly-under-50</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Texas has emerged as one of the United States' coronavirus hot spots in recent weeks, and data shows the recent spike doesn't completely match up with the early days of the pandemic in terms of demographics. Back in April, when the virus first peaked, most of the patients testing positive in the Houston Methodist Hospital system were over 50, The New York Times reports. Now, the majority are reportedly relatively young. And while it's widely believed younger, healthier people are at a lower risk of developing severe infections or dying, there are no guarantees. In the Methodist system, nearly one-third of intensive care patients are under 50, which the Times notes is higher than the previous surge. Meanwhile, The Texas Tribune and Fox4 in Dallas previously reported that people under 50 made up 50 percent of those hospitalized with the virus in June, as well as 30 percent of those in intensive care. Of note: hospitals are seeing younger patients now in June compared to March around when coronavirus started appearing in North Texas. Seeing a sharp jump in hospital patients ages 21-40. 50% of hospitalizations are under 50, 30% critical care under 50. @FOX4 pic.twitter.com/kUqFl8a7Zt â€” Lynnanne Nguyen (@LynnanneFOX4) June 22, 2020 The trend doesn't appear to be confined to Texas, at least anecdotally. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that states like Arizona, Florida, and California were also seeing more patients in their 20s, 30s, and 40s testing positive and winding up in the hospital.

      <title>Mutation has taken over world. Scientists trying to understand why...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Coronavirus-mutation-has-taken-over-the-world-15373472.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the first coronavirus cases in Chicago appeared in January, they bore the same genetic signatures as a germ that emerged in China weeks before.  But as Egon Ozer, an infectious-disease specialist at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, examined the genetic structure of virus samples from local patients, he noticed something different.  A change in the virus was appearing again and again. This mutation, associated with outbreaks in Europe and New York, eventually took over the city. By May, it was found in 95 percent of all the genomes Ozer sequenced.  At a glance, the mutation seemed trivial. About 1,300 amino acids serve as building blocks for a protein on the surface of the virus. In the mutant virus, the genetic instructions for just one of those amino acids - number 614 - switched in the new variant from a "D" (shorthand for aspartic acid) to a "G" (short for glycine).  But the location was significant, because the switch occurred in the part of the genome that codes for the all-important "spike protein" - the protruding structure that gives the coronavirus its crownlike profile and allows it to enter human cells the way a burglar picks a lock.  And its ubiquity is undeniable. Of the approximately 50,000 genomes of the new virus that researchers worldwide have uploaded to a shared database, about 70% carry the mutation, officially designated D614G but known more familiarly to scientists as "G."  "G" hasn't just dominated the outbreak in Chicago - it has taken over the world. Now scientists are racing to figure out what it means.  At least four laboratory experiments suggest that the mutation makes the virus more infectious, although none of that work has been peer-reviewed. Another unpublished study led by scientists at Los Alamos National...</description>

      <link>https://www.chron.com/lifestyle/article/A-hypervigilant-mom-followed-every-health-15373512.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was the Thursday night before Memorial Day weekend when Rebecca Drobis, a 43-year-old mother of an infant daughter in Northwest Washington was suddenly awakened by a faint feeling of chills and wondered if she might be getting sick.  Drobis, a freelance photographer (she has previously worked for The Washington Post), had done everything she could think of to avoid the coronavirus. Her experience, recounted in a recent interview, captures how even a mild case of covid-19 can still be a harrowing ordeal - and how the myriad unknowns of the illness leave its victims without a clear sense of closure or control.  The following account has been edited for length and clarity.  We took the pandemic very seriously right from the outset. My husband's brother was stationed with the Navy in Beijing, so we'd been following the pandemic very closely since January. My daughter, Rosie, was 7 months old in March. Babies under the age of 1 are considered in the high risk category. My parents are in their 70s, and we're very close with them. They used to watch my daughter once a week, and we decided right away to have them stop coming over.  My father is a retired doctor, so we've always been hyper-aware of germs and washing our hands, and after you have a newborn, you're just crazy about wiping everything down. I ordered masks right away. We stopped going to the grocery store. We had everything delivered. We took the stay-at-home orders very seriously.  We were only leaving our house to go for a walk. Sometimes, to maintain distance, I would push Rosie's stroller into the bike lane or the street. You make these decisions every time you go out: Is the danger from an oncoming car or from all the people around us walking their dogs who aren't wearing masks? We do our best, but you can't always stay six feet apart on the sidewalk.  I...</description>

      <title>Country singers criticize Chase Rice for concert in front of hundreds...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/Country-singers-criticize-Chase-Rice-as-selfish-15373220.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Country singer Chase Rice played his first in-person concert in months on Saturday night and appeared thrilled to do so. "We back," he wrote in an Instagram story with a smiley face sunglasses emoji, accompanied by video of hundreds of people singing along to his recent hit, "Eyes On You."  But on social media, many were horrified to see images of a packed crowd, with no masks and no social distancing - especially as the concert took place in Tennessee, which is experiencing a significant spike in coronavirus infections. As the videos started circulating on Twitter, other country singers took the unusual step of calling out Rice by name.  "Imagine being selfish enough to put thousands of people's health at risk, not to mention the potential ripple effect, and play a NORMAL country concert right now. @ChaseRiceMusic," Kelsea Ballerini tweeted to her million followers. "We all want (and need) to tour. We just care about our fans and their families enough to wait."  Mickey Guyton responded and included Rice's Twitter handle: "An absolute selfish act. Shame on him." Maren Morris replied to one of Guyton's tweets and simply said, "No masks," with head-exploding and frowning-face emojis.  Bobby Bones, the format's most powerful radio personality, tweeted the video and wrote, "Aside from the obvious .... probably also heavy liability here. Just talked to two different attorneys about this."  The concert took place at Historic Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary, a former prison turned tourist destination that has a distillery, paranormal tours and a concert series called "Live at Brushy" - it's located in Petros, Tenn., a 2½-hour drive from Nashville. Brian May, vice president of the Brushy Mountain Group, said in a statement Sunday evening that fewer than 1,000 people attended Rice's show, even though the venue's maximum...</description>

      <title>CAMPAIGN SCRAMBLES TO BOOST REELECTION</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Analysis-Trump-campaign-scrambles-to-boost-15372432.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and his campaign team are grappling with how to resuscitate his imperiled reelection effort amid a wave of polling that shows him trailing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and losing traction even among core constituencies.  Some Trump advisers and allies are privately pushing for sweeping changes to the campaign, including the idea of a major staff shake-up and trying to convince the president to be more disciplined in his message and behavior.  But so far, the campaign has settled only on incremental changes - such as hiring and elevating several operatives who worked on Trump's upset victory in 2016 - and has yet to settle on a clear message for his reelection. Campaign officials and other advisers are also still struggling with how to best focus their attacks on Biden, which so far have been scattershot and have failed to curb his rise among voters.  And then there's Trump himself, who has derailed his team's desired themes on an almost daily basis - deploying racist rhetoric and mounting incendiary attacks on critics amid a surging coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis and roiling protests over police brutality.  Numerous national polls show Trump losing significant ground with seniors and among white voters, including those with and without four-year college degrees. He has also slipped among white evangelical voters. According to new New York Times/Siena College polls, Trump is at least slightly behind Biden in six states that he won in 2016 and are pivotal to his reelection path - including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where he trails by double digits.  "You can't win with these numbers. They're atrocious numbers," said Edward Rollins, co-chairman of the pro-Trump super PAC Great America and the former campaign manager for Ronald Reagan's 1984 reelection...</description>
