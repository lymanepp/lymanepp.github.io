      <title>Trump increasingly concerned about how would appear if sick...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/922478/trump-reportedly-grown-increasingly-concerned-about-how-appear-contracted-coronavirus</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publicly, President Trump has appeared undaunted by the coronavirus. He mostly refuses to wear a mask in public, eschewing federal guidelines, and has recently held large campaign rallies in states where the pandemic is really just taking off. But privately the president is reportedly concerned about contracting COVID-19, primarily because he's aware of how it would affect both the country's view of him and his ability to lead, CNN reports. So, despite Trump's more casual attitude while he's speaking to crowds and posting on Twitter, the White House has gone to great lengths to make sure the commander-in-chief doesn't get infected. Every venue he enters while traveling is first inspected by advance security and medical teams, bathrooms designated for his use are scrubbed and sanitized before his arrival, and staff maintain a close eye on whom he'll come into contact with to make sure they get tested prior to any sort of meeting, people familiar with the matter told CNN. So far, the practice has worked out for the president, although several campaign aides and Secret Service personnel recently tested positive. But, per CNN, some of Trump's advisers and allies have become more and more concerned that he is publicly moving on from the pandemic too soon, a decision that seems all the more paradoxical considering how watchful the White House is behind the scenes.

      <title>BAREFACE BECOMES POLITICAL RISK</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/As-support-for-mask-wearing-grows-so-do-15370218.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump makes a point of not wearing a mask. A barefaced Vice President Mike Pence did not utter the m-word at a coronavirus briefing Friday.  Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, meanwhile, has gone in the other direction. A mask is part of his 2020 signature look.  This divergent accessorizing once highlighted yet another partisan divide. For Trump allies, going barefaced is all about individual liberty. For Biden supporters, the mask is a symbol of science and sound policy.  But as infections spike in red states such as Texas, Florida and Arizona, support for masks has grown. In recent days, even some Republicans have urged the public to cover their faces in public, arguing that it's the best way to slow the virus. This shift in rhetoric highlights the potential risks for the president as he continues to eschew public health experts, who agree that masks are crucial to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.  "It does go to character and values," Democratic pollster Joel Benenson said. "Biden is known for being decent, for caring about the country, a middle-class guy, working with people on the other side. Trump is the antithesis of that. So the more Trump tries to attack Biden over petty smaller things, the smaller it makes Trump look."  Polling suggests that the majority of Americans favor facial coverings.  More than 70 percent of Americans believe that people should wear masks most or all of the time in public places, according to a Pew Research survey from mid-June.  A Fox News poll from last week found that 80 percent hold a favorable view of those who wear masks, including 68 percent of Republicans and 61 percent of respondents who strongly approve of Trump.  Some Republican leaders have echoed those favorable views. . ..</description>

      <title>Reopenings, record cases and full hospitals...</title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Reopenings-record-cases-and-full-hospitals-15370304.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Americans are living through a split-screen pandemic: Their leaders are relaxing restrictions while their states set records for new coronavirus infections. Churches, beaches and bars are filling up, and so are hospital beds.  Early in the outbreak, President Donald Trump told governors they were on their own - for testing, medical supplies and stay-at-home orders. Now, in this new phase of soaring cases and reopenings, the effects of this decentralized decision-making are particularly noticeable and subject to politics, with some states making seemingly arbitrary decisions.  Experts note a troubling lack of consistent, unified messaging from Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who have downplayed the danger and denigrated effective disease defenses such as mask-wearing, testing and social distancing - even as the administration's own health officials contradict them. The coronavirus task force briefings, where health officials updated the public daily, disappeared weeks ago.  On Thursday, the country reported more than 39,000 new cases, its highest-ever single-day count, according to data gathered and analyzed by The Washington Post. The counties home to Dallas, Phoenix and Tampa all reported record-high averages on at least 15 straight days in June.  In many places, the number of people sick enough to be hospitalized has also increased sharply. Those hardest hit include the largest states - California, Texas, Florida - and those that thought they had the virus under control, like Utah and Oregon.  "I think the politicians are in denial," said Kami Kim, director of the Division of Infectious Disease and International Medicine at the University of South Florida.  The push to reopen quickly even as cases climb sends a dangerous and inaccurate message, said Andrew Pavia, the chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious...</description>

      <title>ALL IN THE FAMILY: Mary Trump stood up to her uncle Donald. Her book describes 'nightmare' of dysfunction...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Mary-Trump-once-stood-up-to-her-uncle-Donald-15368513.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary L. Trump was embroiled in a feud over her inheritance two decades ago when her uncle Donald Trump and his siblings punched back in classic style. In an obscure court filing, they belittled her, alleging she "lives primarily off the Trump income" and is "not gainfully employed."  Actually, Mary Trump had embarked on a new career. She studied patients with schizophrenia at Hillsdale Hospital on Long Island for at least six months during this period, meeting with an array of people who were delusional, hallucinatory and suicidal.  Over time, she deepened her studies of the disorder, contributed to a book on treating schizophrenia, wrote a dissertation on stalkers, and became a clinical psychologist. But not since she became part of the lawsuit in 2000 against her uncle has she spoken in detail about what she sees as the disorders of Donald Trump.  Now her silence could be coming to an end. Her book about her uncle - "Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man" - is slated to be published next month. The book is so potentially explosive that the Trump family is seeking to block publication, citing a confidentiality agreement that Mary Trump signed as part of a settlement about her inheritance. Mary Trump's lawyer, Theodore Boutrous Jr., said the president is trying to "suppress a book that will discuss matters of utmost public importance."  The publisher has not revealed specifics, and Mary Trump, 55, declined an interview request. But clues to her dark view of her uncle can be seen in lawsuits, and interviews with former colleagues and teachers, academic papers and a series of now-deleted tweets, including one that said her uncle's election was the "worst night of my life."  A description of the book from publisher Simon &amp; Schuster suggests it will draw heavily on her studies of...</description>

      <title>SEASICK: 90% of U.S.-bound cruise ships brought virus...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/922354/121-cruise-ships-came-after-march-1-just-15-didnt-have-coronavirus-onboard</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coronavirus sent the cruise ship industry into a crisis that's still far from over. Even before COVID-19 was even declared a global pandemic, the U.S. began warning its citizens to stay off cruise ships to avoid catching the virus. And it turns out it had good reason for doing so: Of the 121 cruise ships that entered U.S. waters after March 1, all but 15 of them had at least one coronavirus case onboard, The New York Times reports via Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. While Americans had warnings about traveling abroad, especially on the confined space of a ship, many still ended up stranded offshore for weeks in early March as the government scrambled to test for and contain COVID-19 cases. The coronavirus spread was especially dangerous due to the largely older clientele that typically take cruises. In total, more than 3,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19 cases connected to their cruises, and at least 82 died, according to an analysis by the Miami Herald. It's been more than three months since the CDC issued a no-sail order that halted all cruises from heading out from the U.S., and almost as long since the last quarantined passengers disembarked. But as of Sunday, 21,506 crew members are still out in American waters, waiting aboard 68 ships as public health officials struggle to get them back home safely, the Times reports. Read more about COVID-19's effects on the cruise industry â€” and how they plan to get back to normal â€” at The New York Times. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
