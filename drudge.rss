      <title>Network of news sites must register as political committee due to Dem links, complaint alleges...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Network-of-news-sites-must-register-as-a-15539836.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A new complaint filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission alleges that a national network of local media websites must register as a political committee because of its ties to a Democratic-aligned group.  Courier Newsroom, which includes seven news sites concentrated in presidential swing states,is backed by ACRONYM, a politically active nonprofit run by Democratic strategist Tara McGowan.  Federal election laws and regulations do not apply to media outlets unless they are "owned or controlled by" a political party, committee or candidate and are acting as a media outlet rather than a political one.  But the complaint, filed by Americans for Public Trust, a watchdog group affiliated with former Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt, a Republican, alleges that Courier Newsroom is not eligible for that exemption and that the media group failed to register as a political group and report its donors and expenses as is required of political groups under federal law.  The complaint points to a June 2019 ACRONYM internal memo, in which McGowan wrote that the group was launching a "for-profit digital media company building out online news properties in seven 2020 battleground states" of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona.  In the memo, McGowan warned that Democrats are "losing the media war" online to the Republican Party and to President Donald Trump's campaign, and laid out her plan for Courier Newsroom to counter that GOP advantage.  "Building this media content network - majority owned by ACRONYM - will: Enable Democrats to compete with Republican echo chambers online; Build nimble communications infrastructure for Dems in critical states; Reach voters with strategic narratives + information year-round; Make cyclical investments in paid advertising more...</description>

      <title>FDA DEBATE RAGES</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Debate-rages-over-whether-FDA-should-use-15538911.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A fierce debate has erupted over whether the Food and Drug Administration should use its emergency authority to clear a coronavirus vaccine before it is formally approved - a move opponents warn could pose safety dangers and inflame anti-vaccination sentiment but others say could save thousands of lives by speeding protection from the virus.  With concerns growing about the politicization of the FDA amid a botched White House rollout of the agency's emergency authorization of convalescent plasma and sharply criticized comments by FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, some scientists and bioethicists are demanding the agency forgo use of its emergency authority for a vaccine. They worry its very flexibility, which gives FDA officials broad latitude, could it make it easier for the White House to pressure the agency into clearing an unproven vaccine before Election Day, Nov. 3.  President Donald Trump's repeated promise to deliver a safe and effective vaccine this year, "or maybe even sooner," has become central to his reelection campaign and has sparked concerns in the scientific community in particular that the White House could pressure regulators to cut corners.  Those concerns come against the backdrop of an accelerating race to develop a coronavirus vaccine as three vaccine makers - pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, biotechnology firm Moderna and drugmaker AstraZeneca - conduct Phase 3 clinical trials, the last before seeking a green light from regulators.  A recent report by Morgan Stanley said the most likely timing for data from one or more of the trials is November. But others say it's possible some results might be available in October if the vaccines prove spectacularly effective and there are enough viral infections in the community to prove the shots are protecting patients who receive them.  The CDC has...</description>

      <title>HUNGER SPIKES: 10% of U.S. households going hungry...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/935466/10th-american-households-say-havent-enough-food-during-pandemic</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stock market is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, but working Americans are not. The coronavirus pandemic led to business shutdowns that in turn translated into the biggest employment numbers the country has ever seen. The slumping economy shocked even the most food secure states in the U.S., with one in ten Americans reporting they didn't have enough food during a given week amid the pandemic, Bloomberg reports. While the U.S. is no stranger to hunger, it usually is at its worst in the rural south, while midwestern states ranked among the most food secure in the country. And when the whole country has gone hungry in the past, it usually stemmed from food shortages, like during the Dust Bowl or World War II rationing, Bloomberg notes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, meanwhile, farmers had to dump millions of gallons of milk and other food they couldn't sell or donate. Even Americans 'surrounded by food' haven't been able to afford to eat during this pandemic, Bloomberg writes. That included people in the farm-rich state of Minnesota, where nearly 70 percent of those accessing emergency food pantries were doing so for the first time. Across the country, a third of hungry Americans used emergency food distributors for the first time as well, according to Feeding America. And with millions of Americans still out of work, many people are still without sufficient food supplies. President Trump on Tuesday didn't mention the rampant hunger still lingering throughout the U.S. as he praised August's 'very impressive' stock market rebound. Read more at Bloomberg.
