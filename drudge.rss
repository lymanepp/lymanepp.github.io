      <title>'Juiced ball' claims as MLB hitters blasting record home runs...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/MLB-hitters-are-blasting-homers-at-a-record-rate-13799008.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BALTIMORE - It's not exactly true that the Baltimore Orioles' pitching staff is single-handedly responsible for the staggering spike in home runs across Major League Baseball this season - but when you're standing on the mound or sitting in the dugout at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, watching another long flyball leave the yard, it's natural sometimes for it to feel that way.  "I've never seen home runs given up like we do," Orioles manager Brandon Hyde marveled last week.  That's because no one has ever seen home runs given up like the 2019 Orioles. Before this month, the major league record for homers allowed before the end of April was 50 by the 1996 Detroit Tigers. The Orioles zoomed past that record on April 20 - a day that saw them give up 11 long balls in a doubleheader sweep at the hands of the Minnesota Twins. Entering Friday, with five days left before the calendar turns to May, the Orioles' total sat at 59.  But the Orioles are merely an extreme example of something taking place all across the game. Even in an era of unprecedented, leaguewide home-run power, the first month of the 2019 season stands out. Entering Friday, teams had combined to hit a record 979 homers - an average of 1.32 per team-game. That's 116 more than teams hit in April 2017, a season that would eventually see a record 6,105 homers.  In other words, the 2019 home run rate is 5 percent higher than the highest rate in history (1.26 per team-game in 2017), and up 15 percent from last year, when the leaguewide rate dipped to 1.15.  And what is truly scary is that the early part of the season normally produces the lowest rate of homers. What's going to happen when the weather warms, typically resulting in balls carrying further? At least in Baltimore, nobody seems to have any answers.  "I have no idea," Orioles reliever Mychal Givens said. "But...</description>
