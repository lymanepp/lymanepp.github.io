      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Abroad-the-sting-of-Trump-s-tweets-dulls-13806268.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that Britain's intelligence service had helped the Obama administration spy on his 2016 campaign, the British metaphorically yawned and issued verbatim their response to the same Trump charge more than two years earlier.  "Nonsense. . . . Utterly ridiculous and should be ignored," said a spokesman for Government Communications Headquarters, the British equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency.  The same day, when Trump tweeted for the umpteenth time that Mexico "is not doing nearly enough" to apprehend drug smugglers and migrants, and threatened to send "ARMED SOLDIERS" to the border, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador figuratively shrugged.  Mexico would, of course, look into any U.S. concerns, López Obrador said at a Mexico City news conference. But "the most important thing is to tell [Trump] that we are not going to fight with the government of the United States. . . . We are not going to be tripped up by any provocation."  Friendly countries that have been the target of Trump's tweets have learned he is not always bluffing. Aluminum and steel tariffs really were imposed on allies, and the Pentagon is sending more troops to assist in Border Patrol operations.  But few now take Trump's Twitter fulminations at immediate face value. "He has shown us that what's black at 9 a.m. can be gray at 3 p.m. and white at 7 p.m.," said a Mexican diplomat of the president's revolving pronouncements.  Most have learned that responding in kind only makes matters worse. "If you don't pick a fight with him, you take away from Trump the possibility of further enraging himself and everybody else," said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid fueling any fires.  Gérard Araud, France's U.S. ambassador until earlier this month, said he told his...</description>

      <title>President's lack of cooperation with Congress sparks more impeachment push...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Trump-s-lack-of-cooperation-with-Congress-sparks-13805488.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Frustration among House Democratic investigators is intensifying after President Donald Trump's refusal to cooperate with congressional inquiries, leading some to privately question whether they should try to pressure Speaker Nancy Pelosi into launching impeachment proceedings.  The chairmen and members of the six panels investigating the president are increasingly angered by the White House's unwillingness to comply as they carry out their oversight role, according to several House Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter freely. But that anger extends into the ranks of Pelosi's team as well, according to leadership officials.  A recent threat by Attorney General William Barr not to show up for a scheduled hearing Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee has exacerbated the situation after the White House last week vowed to block some officials from appearing for subpoenaed depositions or interviews.  Earlier this month, several lawmakers from the most liberal wing of the caucus had called for impeachment after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. But Pelosi, D-Calif., fearing 2020 election fallout from such a politically divisive step, had asked Democratic investigators to hold off and continue their inquiries.  But Trump's no-cooperation stance is blocking that mission; his team has publicly directed administration officials to ignore House Democrats, prompting several of the more-establishment Democrats to favor pursuing impeachment in a notable shift on Capitol Hill. Pelosi makes the final decision.  "The Mueller report and this assault on the legislative branch made Nancy's call to avoid impeachment much more difficult for rank-and-file members," said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., a member of the Oversight Committee. "We've moved from...</description>

      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Abroad-the-sting-of-Trump-s-tweets-dulls-13806268.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that Britain's intelligence service had helped the Obama administration spy on his 2016 campaign, the British metaphorically yawned and issued verbatim their response to the same Trump charge more than two years earlier.  "Nonsense. . . . Utterly ridiculous and should be ignored," said a spokesman for Government Communications Headquarters, the British equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency.  The same day, when Trump tweeted for the umpteenth time that Mexico "is not doing nearly enough" to apprehend drug smugglers and migrants, and threatened to send "ARMED SOLDIERS" to the border, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador figuratively shrugged.  Mexico would, of course, look into any U.S. concerns, López Obrador said at a Mexico City news conference. But "the most important thing is to tell [Trump] that we are not going to fight with the government of the United States. . . . We are not going to be tripped up by any provocation."  Friendly countries that have been the target of Trump's tweets have learned he is not always bluffing. Aluminum and steel tariffs really were imposed on allies, and the Pentagon is sending more troops to assist in Border Patrol operations.  But few now take Trump's Twitter fulminations at immediate face value. "He has shown us that what's black at 9 a.m. can be gray at 3 p.m. and white at 7 p.m.," said a Mexican diplomat of the president's revolving pronouncements.  Most have learned that responding in kind only makes matters worse. "If you don't pick a fight with him, you take away from Trump the possibility of further enraging himself and everybody else," said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid fueling any fires.  Gérard Araud, France's U.S. ambassador until earlier this month, said he told his...</description>

      <title>Percentage of Dems who see border 'crisis' jumps...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Poll-Percentage-of-Democrats-who-see-border-13806243.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - More than a third of Americans say that illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border is at a "crisis," up 11 percentage points since January as Democrats have grown sharply more concerned about the issue, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.  At the same time, Americans assign a similar level of blame to congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump for the situation, the survey finds, signaling that both political parties face challenges on immigration heading into the 2020 presidential election cycle.  The Trump administration is struggling to handle a surge of migrant families arriving at the southern border with Mexico, where the number of apprehensions by Customs and Border Protection topped 100,000 in March, the largest monthly total in a dozen years, according to federal data. Although Trump responded by installing new leadership at the Department of Homeland Security three weeks ago, the number of migrants was on pace to reach a similar level in April, authorities said.  The poll, conducted by cellular and landline telephone between April 22 and 25, finds that 35 percent of Americans believe the situation is a crisis, up from 24 percent in January. While that figure included a modest increase among Republicans and independents, the percentage of Democrats who agree jumped from 7 percent to 24 percent, nearly a quarter of the p arty.  A still-larger 45 percent plurality of the public overall says illegal immigration across the southern border is a serious problem but not a crisis, while 18 percent say it is not a serious problem.  The shifting views have altered the political calculus for Democrats, including the 20 candidates already in the race for the party's presidential nomination, who have sought to challenge Trump's hard-line rhetoric on immigration. Having once accused the...</description>

      <title>White nationalists target bookstores in protests nationwide... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/White-nationalists-target-bookstores-and-a-13805381.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a group of self-avowed white nationalists interrupted an author chat Saturday at Washington bookstore Politics and Prose with a megaphone and chants of "This land is our land," workers were surprised but not unprepared.  The bookstore began training employees earlier this year to respond to flash protests, co-owner Bradley Graham said. The decision came after previous author events, including a talk last month by former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, drew the ire and attention of left-wing activists and agitators.  Politics and Prose isn't alone.  Bookstores, libraries and book fairs have become frequent targets of white nationalist groups, which in recent years have interrupted author talks, children's reading hours and, in one instance, threatened to burn down a bookstore in Berkeley, California.  "One of the issues is we can't always anticipate what author or event might draw protesters or a demonstration," Graham said. "Clearly, when the political climate heats up, there would seem to be more kindling that could be lit. But whether this will translate to more disturbances at author talks, I certainly hope not, but who knows."  Patrick Casey, co-founder of the white-nationalist group American Identity Movement, strode into the bookstore Saturday, holding a megaphone branded with the organization's insignia and led a chant of "AIM" on his way out the door.  The group, which formed last month and is based in the Washington area, is considered by several organizations that track hate groups to be a rebranded version of Identity Evropa, an organization that has sought to recruit college students and young conservatives to join its ranks through posters and online propaganda, according to the Anti-Defamation League.  Leaders of the American Identity...</description>
