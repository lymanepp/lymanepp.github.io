      <title>Bye-bye Bolton? </title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Bye-bye-Bolton-13907370.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are far enough into the Trump administration to know how the script usually plays out when a Cabinet officer or high-ranking staffer is on the outs with the president. First, Trump asks everyone within his orbit what he thinks of the imperiled official. Second, reports of Trump's dissatisfaction hit the press. Third, those stories often contain incidents of Trump mocking the official on the chopping block. Fourth, Trump denies everything and claims it to be fake news. Fifth, Trump fires the person.  To be fair, sometimes the script is not that rote. Staffers like Gary Cohn and Don McGahn managed to infuriate the president but depart on their own accord. The same was true of Nikki Haley. Rod Rosenstein managed to wheedle his way back into Trump's good graces. And sometimes the gap between Step Four and Step Five can be long and agonizing. John Kelly was on the outs with Trump for much of 2018 but managed to hang around until December.  This brings us to national security adviser John Bolton. Reports about dissatisfaction with Bolton have been percolating for a while now. As Bolton husbanded control of the national security decision-making process, resentment among other policy principals has grown. There have been multiple accounts of friction between Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that have little to do with policy and everything to do with style. After the failed transition in Venezuela, The Washington Post's Anne Gearan, Josh Dawsey, John Hudson and Seung Min Kim reported, "The president's dissatisfaction has crystallized around national security adviser John Bolton and what Trump has groused is an interventionist stance at odds with his view that the United States should stay out of foreign quagmires."  Now, Bolton faces the dreaded confirmation of Trump dissatisfaction in the form of a Peter Baker and...</description>

      <title>DEMS DIVIDED: COMPROMISE OR CONQUER?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Democrats-are-divided-Compromise-or-conquer-13908460.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A split has emerged among the Democratic presidential candidates over whether the party should aim to work with Republicans or wage war against them, a division stemming from a belief by many rank-and-file Democrats that the GOP has stopped playing by the old rules.  Former vice president Joe Biden repeatedly touts the need to return to an era of bipartisan comity, saying that "compromise is not a dirty word" and predicting that Republicans will have an "epiphany" on bipartisanship after President Donald Trump is out of office.  Others say Biden's view is naive and harks back to an era of bipartisanship that no longer exists, rather than confronting the hardball tactics that have helped Republicans notch big political wins in recent years.  "We're done with two sets of rules, one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a candidate for the presidency, said recently, suggesting that if Democrats win the Senate they should consider eliminating the filibuster rule that requires 60 votes to pass most legislation.  Another Democrat seeking the presidency, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, echoed that sentiment in an interview this week. He cited an Obama-era fiscal deal, engineered in part by Biden and which Bennet argued had ceded too much to the GOP, as "a perfect example of Washington dysfunction masquerading as empty bipartisanship."  The division crystallizes a question that could dominate the Democratic contest and goes to the heart of what the party, and the country, will be in the current era: Do most voters want a president who can bring the nation together or one who will steamroll the other side in what many partisans see as a far-reaching war over culture, ideology and the very definition of American identity?  The party dispute has been underlined by a disagreement among...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mediaite.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evidenced by his Twitter feed, President Donald Trump woke up Thursday morning with Special Counsel Robert Mueller -- and his stunning nine-minute press conference -- very much on his mind. In a remarkable development, however, it appears that Trump is publicly admitting, for the first time at least, that Russia interference helped get him elected president, as has been stated repeatedly by numerous U.S. intel and Justice Department investigations, including the office of Special Counsel. That is until he deleted the tweet. Here are the screenshots of the tweets in which Trump says he "had nothing to do with Russia helping me get elected." While Mueller, in his press conference on Wednesday, mostly reiterated much of what was in his 400+ page report into the investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 general election, there were a few eyebrow-raising moments.
