      <title>Americans say  current economy is best since 1990s...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Americans-say-they-feel-the-current-economy-is-15045620.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Americans increasingly rate this as the best economy since the late 1990s, with a recent surge in optimism, even though many economic metrics show striking similarities to the final years of the Obama administration.  Fifty-nine percent of Americans say they are better off financially today than they were a year ago, the highest since 1999, according to a Gallup survey released last week. And nearly three-quarters predict they will do better a year from now, the most optimistic reading that Gallup's annual "Mood of the Nation" survey has ever recorded.  Other polls and surveys aren't quite as ebullient, but nearly all show that Americans are far less worried about the economy and their personal financial situations than they were during the last presidential election.  Upbeat sentiment is critical for the U.S. economy because it motivates consumer spending, the most important driver of U.S. economic growth. And President Donald Trump is counting on a strong economy to motivate voters to turn out at the polls and reelect him.  Bryan DeHenau runs a roofing business in Macomb County, Michigan, just outside Detroit. Around the time of the last presidential election, he had enough jobs to keep one crew busy, but some of the gigs were barely profitable. Today he can keep three crews busy during the spring and summer months, and he has been able to raise prices, regularly giving people estimates of $20,000 to totally redo a roof and finding that "they don't even bat an eye about it anymore."  "I'm driving a brand-new 2019 Ford F-250. I've got work coming out the ying-yang. I'm doing OK," DeHenau said. "Four years ago, I couldn't sleep at night. That's a pretty big turnaround."  Some of the biggest recent increases in consumer confidence have come from independent voters and less affluent households, according to...</description>

      <title>President floats 'powerful death penalty' for drug dealers...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/895056/trump-floats-death-penalty-drug-dealers--big-twist-from-criminal-justice-push</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump's latest comments about China would be ironic if they weren't so disturbing. Trump hosted governors from around the country on Monday and gave a wide-ranging speech where he complained about the European Union's apparent bullying and then totally reversed his stance on criminal justice reform. While Trump touted clemency for drug offenders as recently as in his Super Bowl ad, he complimented China's 'maximum penalty' for 'drug dealers' and how it's led to the country having 'very little drug problem.' Trump first complimented what's going on in the authoritarian government of China, and then praised some of the governors in front of him. 'States with a very powerful death penalty on drug dealers don't have a drug problem,' Trump said, though he added 'I don't know if our country is ready for that.' Trump suggests he'd like to model American criminal law on drug dealing on authoritarian systems like China, where dealers are executed: 'Countries with a powerful death penalty, with a fair but quick trial, they have very little if any drug problem. That includes China.' pic.twitter.com/9WprysjJAX â€” Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 10, 2020 In contrast, Trump's Super Bowl ad featured Alice Marie Johnson thanking the president for granting her clemency after she'd been in prison for more than 20 years on drug-related charges. The ad was reportedly Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's way of appealing to black voters. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
