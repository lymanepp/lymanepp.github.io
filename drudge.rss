      <title>First private Israeli lunar mission to launch...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/af0168ec78cc4144b8c1bd23327ef75a</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;YEHUD, Israel (AP) — An Israeli nonprofit on Monday said it has pushed back the launch of what it hopes will be the first private spacecraft to land on the moon until February. Officials from SpaceIL and its project partner, the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries, announced that the landing craft, dubbed "Beresheet," or Genesis, will ship in February to Florida. Propelled by a SpaceX Falcon rocket launch, the robotic lander will then commence its months-long voyage to the moon. It had been slated to launch this month.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Late last summer, near the conclusion of training camp, a reporter asked Chicago Bears General Manager Ryan Pace about his team's window of contention. How cognizant was Pace of not only building for the future with a second-year quarterback, but also attempting to win immediately, before Mitchell Trubisky's bargain rookie deal grew more expensive? "That is something we internally talk about," Pace replied. "There's no question, the obvious advantages to that, versus going out and signing. In a perfect world, any franchise would want to hit on a young, drafted quarterback, as opposed to maybe hitting on it in free agency, where the financial part is different.</description>

      <title>DC proposal would let police take guns from people accused of domestic abuse...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/D-C-proposal-would-let-police-take-guns-from-13470614.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The D.C. Council on Tuesday could pass new laws restricting the ability of gun owners to modify weapons and require police to seize guns while enforcing protective orders in domestic disputes. The latter provision - known as a "red flag law" - is gaining popularity, with variants implemented in more than a dozen states, including Maryland. The D.C. version would mandate that authorities take firearms out of the hands of suspected abusers more quickly than is permitted under existing laws. Other proposed laws, if passed, would the ban rapid-fire attachments known as bump stocks and increase penalties for extended magazines, accessories that allow guns to fire faster and hold more bullets.</description>
