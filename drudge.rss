      <title>Barr plans to mount defiant defense of Trump in showdown with House Dems...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/What-to-expect-when-Barr-is-questioned-by-the-15438189.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Attorney General William Barr will tell the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that President Donald Trump has not inappropriately intervened in Justice Department business - even though Barr has more than once moved in criminal cases to help the president's allies - and he will defend the administration's response to civil unrest in the country, according to a copy of his opening statement.  Barr, according to the statement, will take a defiant posture as he testifies before the panel for the first time since Democrats took control of it, alleging that they have attempted to "discredit" him since he vowed to investigate the 2016 FBI probe of possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, and that the media has been unfair in covering unrest. He is expected to face critical questioning on his response to anti-police-brutality protests across the nation, his controversial interventions in high-profile cases involving allies of Trump and many other matters.  According to a Democratic committee counsel, lawmakers will ask Barr about his role in dispatching federal agents to respond to police-brutality protests that have at times grown violent - first in the District of Columbia and, more recently in Portland, Ore. Several Democratic leaders - including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, N.Y. - have asked the Justice Department and Homeland Security inspectors general to probe the federal government's actions in those cities and raised questions about whether they were legal.  "Citizens are concerned that the Administration has deployed a secret police force, not to investigate crimes but to intimidate individuals it views as political adversaries, and that the use of these tactics will proliferate throughout the country," Nadler and others wrote earlier this month.  Barr will...</description>

      <title>Scientists growing miniature human organs to test drugs...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/927696/scientists-are-3d-printing-miniature-human-organs-test-coronavirus-drugs</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether the goal is to find a treatment for COVID-19 or another disease, scientists often have to conduct preliminary tests on animals to determine whether the drug is safe or effective in people. It's not always a one-for-one comparison, but The New York Times reports there may be a new way around that step going forward: 3-D printing. For example, Anthony Atala, the director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and his team are using 3-D printers to create tiny replicas of human organs, including miniature lungs and colons, which are particularly affected by the coronavirus. They send them overnight for testing at a biosafety lab at George Mason University. The idea predated the coronavirus â€” Atala said he never thought 'we'd be considering this for a pandemic' â€” but it could come in handy and help expedite the experimental drug process, especially since Atala said his Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based lab can churn out thousands of printed organs per hour. 'The 3-D models can circumvent animal testing and make the pathway stronger from the lab to the clinic,' said Akhilesh Gaharwar, who directs a lab in the biomedical engineering at Texas A&amp;M University.

      <title>One question still dogs Trump: Why not try harder to solve crisis?</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/One-question-still-dogs-Trump-Why-not-try-harder-15436174.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both President Donald Trump's advisers and operatives laboring to defeat him increasingly agree on one thing: The best way for him to regain his political footing is to wrest control of the coronavirus.  In the six months since the deadly contagion was first reported in the United States, Trump has demanded the economy reopen and children return to school, all while scrambling to salvage his reelection campaign.  But both allies and opponents agree he has failed at the one task that could help him achieve all of his goals - confronting the pandemic with a clear strategy and consistent leadership.  Trump's shortcomings have perplexed even some of his most loyal allies, who increasingly have wondered why the president has not at least pantomimed a sense of command over the crisis or conveyed compassion for the millions of Americans impacted by it.  People close to Trump, many speaking anonymously to share candid discussions and impressions, say the president's inability to wholly address the crisis is due to his almost pathological unwillingness to admit error; a positive feedback loop of overly rosy assessments and data from advisers and Fox News; and a penchant for magical thinking that prevented him from fully engaging with the pandemic.  In recent weeks, with more than 146,000 Americans now dead from the virus, the White House has attempted to overhaul - or at least rejigger - its approach. The administration has revived news briefings led by Trump himself and presented the president with projections showing how the virus is now decimating Republican states full of Trump voters. Officials have also set up a separate, smaller coronavirus working group led by Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, along with Trump son-in-law and senior adviser...</description>

      <title>NASA rover Perseverance will prowl ancient lake bed on Mars for signs of life...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/NASA-rover-Perseverance-will-prowl-ancient-lake-15436341.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A $2.7 billion NASA rover is scheduled to blast off for Mars on Thursday on a mission that could help solve one of the greatest mysteries in all of science: the origin of life.  If all goes as planned, the rover, named Perseverance, will collect rock and soil samples that would later be space-mailed back to Earth for close scrutiny. Scientists will be looking for fossils or "biosignatures" of organisms that may have thrived about 3 billion years ago when theRedPlanet was much warmer and wetter.  "We have one data point for life on a planet," said planetary geologist Bethany Ehlmannof the California Institute of Technology, part of the science team for Perseverance. "Mars is the second data point. We know from the investments that we've made from exploration that there was this habitable world right next door. Right about the time that Earth was developing its life, Mars was also habitable, with lakes and rivers."  A close match between ancient Martian life and life here on Earth would suggest a common origin, with one planet seeding the other through meteorites. Or perhaps Mars had life-forms of a completely alien nature. Or maybe they never existed and Mars has always been a sterile world.  "Is it a foregone conclusion that as long as you have the right mix, things are going to happen and you're going to end up with life?" said Mary Voytek, head of NASA's astrobiology program. "We don't really have the answer to that."  The new rover mission is officially known as Mars 2020, and it is the first part of a multiphase project called the Mars Sample Return campaign, only this leg has been fully funded by Congress.  Perseverance will launch from Florida's Cape Canaveral atop an Atlas V rocket. It will be the second robotic mission to Mars in the span of a week: China on Thursday launched its own probe, named Tianwen-1, which...</description>
