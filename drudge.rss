      <title>RECORD FLOOD AT BORDER</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/After-years-of-Trump-s-dire-warnings-a-crisis-13510922.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2015, the year President Donald Trump launched his White House bid with a promise to build a wall on the Mexico border, illegal migration to the United States plunged 31 percent, falling near its lowest level in 50 years. Security experts saw a success, but Trump looked at the border and saw something ominous: "rapists," "criminals" and other predators lurking on the other side. In 2017, Trump's first year in office, he continued to insist on the urgent need for a border wall, even as illegal crossings dropped further. With parts of the federal government shut down over what has morphed into the defining symbol of Trump's presidency, administration officials are clamoring louder than ever.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) — Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is introducing herself to influential Iowa Democrats by telling her personal story of economic opportunity, trying to lay claim in the emerging 2020 presidential field as a champion for a middle class she says is withering under President Donald Trump. On her first full day of campaigning in the kickoff caucus state, Warren said her mother's minimum-wage job saved her family when Warren was a child, and enabled Warren's career as a teacher, professor and now senator considering a presidential run.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — With many federal workers frozen out of the jobs and vacationers blocked from public attractions their tax dollars pay for, talks between White House officials and congressional aides kicked off Saturday aimed at ending a government shutdown that President Donald Trump has said could last years. In what has become a winter of discontent, negotiations are at an impasse over Trump's demands for $5.6 billion to fund a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump, who was not expected to participate in the discussions hosted by Vice President Mike Pence in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, spent the morning tweeting about border security.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some juicy rematches highlight wild-card weekend, in which, well, just about any of the eight teams advancing wouldn't be a surprise. Seattle beat Dallas early this season, and Baltimore handled the Los Angeles Chargers late. The Colts and Texans split two games. Only the Eagles and Bears didn't face off. "That was a different time of the season," says Seahawks defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr., who played for Dallas. "I think we both were at different places in our growth for the season. I think we're both two different teams right now.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a certain point, the manner in which the best in any field evaluate themselves can't be against other practitioners of that same pursuit. LeBron isn't measured against his contemporaries; he's measured against Jordan. Tiger in his prime was chasing not just Nicklaus, but the limits of golf itself. Here, then, are Mikaela Shiffrin's eight most recent results on the World Cup alpine ski circuit: first, first, first, first, first, fifth, first, second. The gap between Shiffrin and the skier in second place in the World Cup's overall standings, Slovakia's Petra Vlhova, covers the gap between Vlhova and Liechtenstein's Tina Weirather, who is in - get this - 14th.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TOKYO - A bluefin tuna sold for a record $3.1 million at the first auction of the year at Tokyo's new fish market on Saturday, but behind the celebrations hides a worrying tale of overfishing and dwindling stocks. Kiyoshi Kimura, who owns the Sushi Zanmai restaurant chain, paid 333.6 million yen for the 613-lb (278-kg) fish at the first auction of the year, and the first to be held at Tokyo's new Toyosu fish market after last year's the move from the famous Tsukiji market. The price at the predawn auction was nearly 10 times higher than the price paid at last year's auction - albeit for a considerably smaller fish - and roughly double the previous record, also set by Kimura, in 2013.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil's newly inaugurated government ordered military police sent to a violent northeastern state Friday following a wave of attacks on banks, public buildings and vehicles over the past two days. Camilo Santana, the governor of Ceara state, said 45 people had been arrested in connection with the dozens of attacks, which have hit 15 cities in the state, including the capital, Fortaleza. The attacks left the burned shells of cars and buses on streets and badly damaged the entrances to buildings.</description>
