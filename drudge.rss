      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite an aggressive crackdown by social media firms, so-called "junk news" is spreading at a greater rate than in 2016 on social media ahead of the US midterm elections, according to researchers. Oxford Internet Institute researchers concluded that Facebook and Twitter remain filled with</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Oklahoma Republicans seized control of every statewide elected office in the 2010 midterm election, and they've maintained their dominance ever since.</description>

      <link>https://apnews.com/b84b5f26ec5e4d5481c5882922c591d8</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXTON, Pennsylvania (AP) — For many voters in America's affluent suburbs, a flourishing economy is forcing a thorny dilemma for the midterm elections. Do they vote Democratic, in part to protest President Donald Trump for behavior some see as divisive and unpresidential? Or do they back Republicans in hopes that the economy will continue thriving under the majority party? A healthy economy has at least complicated their decision and blurred the outcome of the midterm elections . On Friday, the government reported that employers added a robust 250,000 jobs in October. And the unemployment rate stayed at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Democrats are delivering competing closing arguments during the final weekend before Tuesday's elections, but their messages are complicated by a deadly shooting in a politically pivotal state. Trump aimed to drum up voter turnout with events Saturday in Belgrade, Montana, and Pensacola, Florida, about 200 miles west of Florida's capital, Tallahassee, where two people were shot to death and five others wounded at a yoga studio on Friday night.</description>

      <title>Trump presidency faces high stakes in Tuesday elections...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/6c4df5d8d6684e919b6431473684d895</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has been acting like a candidate on the ballot this week, staging daily double-header rallies and blasting out ads for Republicans up for election on Tuesday. Given the stakes for his presidency, he might as well be. A knot of investigations. Partisan gridlock. A warning shot for his re-election bid. Trump faces potentially debilitating fallout should Republicans lose control of one or both chambers in Congress, ending two years of GOP hegemony in Washington. A White House that has struggled to stay on course under favorable circumstances would be tested in dramatic ways. A president who often battles his own party, would face a far less forgiving opposition.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luminaries from both major political parties were set to hit the campaign trail Saturday in a late push to drive up turnout for Tuesday's midterm elections in key battlegrounds that will determine control of Congress and dozens of governorships. President Donald Trump has another pair of rallies planned, in Montana and Florida, two states with marquee Senate races. In Florida, Trump is also trying to bolster the fortunes of Republican gubernatorial hopeful Ron DeSantis, a candidate he endorsed during the GOP primary, who has been lagging in polls behind Democrat Andrew Gillum. If elected, Gillum would be the state's first black governor.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Whatever success Republicans have amassed in taking control of all three branches of U.S. government, and whatever fate awaits them as midterm elections near, some on the right are working to cement change by amending the Constitution. And to the mounting alarm of others on all parts of the spectrum, they want to bypass the usual process. They're pushing for an unprecedented Constitutional convention of the states. While opponents are afraid of what such a convention would do, supporters say it is the only way to deal with the federal government's overreach and ineptitude.</description>
