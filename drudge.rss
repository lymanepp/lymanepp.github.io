      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump celebrated his renomination Thursday with a crowded party at the White House that offered a jarring contrast with a nation that is still widely shut down over fears of the coronavirus pandemic whose spread remains uncontrolled.  More than 1,500 supporters poured onto the South Lawn for his formal acceptance speech to cap the Republican National Convention, and most were not wearing masks, even though they were seated closely together in white folding chairs.  The overwhelming majority of guests were not administered rapid coronavirus tests, Trump campaign and RNC officials said, despite their relative proximity to the president and other White House officials. A White House official said it would have been logistically unfeasible to test such a large number of people.  Two attendees said in interviews that they were not offered tests and were not even put through a more basic screening, such as being questioned whether they had any symptoms, such as coughs, or taking their temperature. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly.  The spectacle offered Trump a reasonable facsimile of the traditionally raucous nominating convention that was canceled this year because of the pandemic. A large stage was set up just beyond the White House portico, lined with dozens of American flags - a dramatic backdrop that allowed the president to wield the visual power of his office at a campaign event despite federal regulations that seek to limit such activities.  But the program also projected the image to millions watching on television that a president whose public approval ratings have fallen over widespread disapproval of his handling of the pandemic has returned to business as usual, even if most Americans have not.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until this week, 2020 was the year sports seemed to matter least. Now, it may become the year sports matter most. Not for games that were played but for those that weren't - and that continue to be scrubbed as players across all major leagues show solidarity with social justice protesters in Wisconsin.  The NBA postponed its three playoff games Wednesday and did the same Thursday, though it intends to resume its postseason at some point. The NHL postponed its playoff games scheduled for Thursday and Friday. MLB went team by team - perhaps reflecting the divisions, and difficulty, in reaching consensus. But with three games postponed Wednesday and seven more postponed Thursday, more than half of the sport's 30 teams joined in the national sports protest.  Washington Nationals Manager Dave Martinez was emotional Wednesday after his team's game, saying: "Proud of the NBA and all the people who stand for justice. You know the way I feel about all this stuff. It's horrible. We need change. We're people."  By Thursday afternoon, the Philadelphia Phillies and Nationals, both unanimously, decided to postpone their game. "This is a humanitarian issue. It's time to speak up," Martinez said. "Tomorrow is Jackie Robinson Day. Jackie will be playing tomorrow."  The Phillies' Rhys Hoskins spoke for his team, noting that the New York Mets' Dominic Smith had broken down in sobs the previous night discussing the pervasive fear among Black people that they or their families could suffer from police brutality. "He's a strong Black man," said Hoskins, who is White. "If that didn't hit you differently, well, it should hit you differently. . . . We've had team conversations this year, and things have come up that I never knew about. As a White person, we need to listen."  Of the bonding through difficult conversations this year in MLB, where...</description>

      <title>MCCONNELL:  DEMS WANT TO REGULATE HAMBURGERS...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/934312/mcconnell-inexplicably-claims-that-democrats-want-tell-americans-how-many-hamburgers-eat</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) asked Americans to 'support Republican Senate candidates across the country and re-elect my friend, President Donald Trump' during the Republican National Convention on Thursday night â€” including making an ominous (and false) threat that Democrats are prepared to take away your hamburgers if you don't. McConnell has been a bit of a reluctant ally â€” and even occasional foe â€” of the president's, even initially announcing he had no plans to talk at the convention before walking the statement back. But speaking from the verdant fields of Kentucky, McConnell stressed the importance of the election for conservative voters. Democrats 'want to tell you when you can go to work, when your kid can go to school,' McConnell claimed. 'They want to tax your job out of existence, and then send you a government check for unemployment.' He added that Democrats 'want to tell you what kind of car you can drive, what sources of information are credible, and even how many hamburgers you can eat.' 'They want to tell you what kind of car you can drive, what sources of information are credible, and even how many hamburgers you can eat' â€” Rep. Mitch McConnell thinks he knows what Democrats are all about #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/8FVJvi032X â€” NowThis (@nowthisnews) August 28, 2020 While it's not true that Democrats are seeking to regulate hamburgers, CNN's Daniel Dale noted that the claim 'may, or may not, be an exaggerated reference to Sen. Kamala Harris's musings about dietary guidelines, which are not mandates.' Either way, McConnell's intention was clear: 'With two more liberal senators, we cannot undo the damage [Democrats have] done,' he said. Jeva Lange</description>

      <title>BALZ:  Brutal campaign shaping up over pandemic, race and economy... </title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Brutal-campaign-shaping-up-over-pandemic-race-15520645.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With just over 10 weeks until Election Day, the campaign for president turns from a pair of scripted conventions to the trench warfare of mobilizing voters and the unpredictability of September and October, with the campaign playing out against a backdrop unlike anything seen in modern times.  In a month, the first of three presidential debates will be held, scheduled for Sept. 29 in Cleveland. Some strategists see that evening as a pivotal and potentially decisive confrontation, particularly if President Donald Trump has a bad night and Joe Biden looks strong. Still, the 2016 campaign moved late and, ultimately, decisively in Trump's direction. Democrats worry about a repeat of that playbook and warn now against complacency.  By the time of the first debate, early voting will have begun in a few states, and the pace will accelerate in October. Controversy over voting by mail is yet another backdrop of the argument between Trump, who claims without evidence that mail ballots are vulnerable to fraud, and Biden, who has charged that Republicans are trying to frustrate voters and suppress Democratic turnout.  A deadly pandemic, an economy struggling to rebound, with millions out of work, and continued racial unrest and calls for racial justice sparked by shootings of unarmed Black men continue to shape Campaign 2020. The trio of crises will be the overriding issues as voters decide whether to give Trump a second term or turn the country over to Biden.  For Trump, the challenge in the weeks ahead will be to undo impressions of nearly four years of chaotic leadership, to demonstrate the kind of discipline and focus that has too often been missing. For Biden, the challenge will be to hold steady while not appearing too passive, to persuade people he has the vision, the policies and the energy to move the country to a more...</description>

      <link>https://www.chron.com/opinion/article/Farewell-to-Kellyanne-Conway-the-ultimate-Woman-15518830.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kellyanne Conway had a two-word weapon that she deployed with shrewd skill during her almost-four-year stint at the White House, and it left her targets defenseless.  Excuse me, she would say, needling a news anchor to permit her to barge into the conversation and take it in a more alternative-factsy direction.  Excuse me, she would say to fellow guests who tried, unsuccessfully, to join in with their own opinions. It was a filibuster of false manners, a prim reminder that she would not be yielding the floor.  "What if his spittle - excuse me - what if (Joe) Biden's spittle had gone beyond the teleprompters and everybody there was at risk?" she demanded, absurdly, at a news conference earlier this summer, turning attention away from President Donald Trump's own coronavirus failures. In a 2018 interview with Chris Cuomo regarding payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, she once excused herself a half-dozen times, all the while steamrolling a narrative that her boss was the real victim in the whole mess.  For Conway, "Excuse me" really meant "Excuse you." It was a shaming. It implied that the the other party was in the wrong for not permitting her bulldozing, browbeating and bloviating. It relied, successfully, on the assumption that nobody wanted to be seen interrupting a tiny blonde woman on live television. And so it excused her.  She is brilliant. She is terrifying.  She is also gone, theoretically. Earlier this week Conway announced she would be resigning from her role as senior adviser to the president. Her Wednesday speech at the Republican National Convention was a farewell of sorts, the last time we can expect to see her behaving as an official mouthpiece for Trump before she retreats to her new "less drama, more mama" lifestyle.  It was the hundredth anniversary of...</description>

      <title>Joe to troll with 2-minute ad set to run during renomination speech...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Biden-to-troll-Trump-with-2-minute-ad-set-to-run-15518989.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden isn't onstage this week as Republicans celebrate their presidential nominating convention. But his campaign is trying to make sure he's on TV.  That presence will come in the form of a two-minute television ad set to debut on broadcast and cable networks Thursday night, offering pricey counterprogramming intended to coincide with President Donald Trump's renomination speech.  The spot largely focuses on a positive message from Biden to America, including his plan to recover from the pandemic, interspersed with details of his biography. And it portrays the 77-year-old candidate as a vibrant and quick-paced campaigner at a time when Republicans are trying to paint him as a washed-up politician who is showing his age.  "Some people are always in a hurry," a narrator says in the opening scene, over a montage of Biden riding a bike, walking away from an Air Force plane, preparing to go onstage and jogging up a ramp.  "When Joe Biden is president, America is just going to have to keep up," the narrator says, citing Biden's plan to deal with the novel coronavirus and proposals to help working families get ahead.  The spot is largely gauzy and high-minded, but it's not entirely Mr. Nice Guy, with some footage designed to trigger Trump on his big day, even though the president is never mentioned by name.  At one point, as the narrator says that some people "race up steps when others take it slow" as a video shows Trump making an unsteady descent on a ramp after giving an address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in June. That's juxtaposed with video of Biden jogging up a similar ramp, from an address he gave at the academy.  (In case anyone misses the reference, a campaign news release accompanying the ad notes that the ad is being released as the general election...</description>

      <title>President mostly absent...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/934046/night-3-rnc-featured-conspicuous-lack-donald-trump</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where was President Trump on Wednesday night? The president loves the spotlight, and he doesn't much like to share it. It's why he was addicted to rallies before the pandemic, and why he did daily coronavirus briefings until his aides convinced him those performances were hurting him politically. Naturally, Trump's campaign announced he would speak all four nights of the Republican National Convention. The RNC is a TV show, and Donald Trump loves being on TV. That's how it worked the first two nights of the convention. The president played the role of a talk show host â€” popping up between speeches to grant live on-camera pardons and host a naturalization ceremony for immigrants becoming citizens. And then, on Wednesday, almost nothing. Trump was completely absent until a brief appearance at Fort McHenry at the end of the night after Vice President Mike Pence's speech. He never said a word. It was a decidedly un-Trumpian performance. So what gives? One possibility: Trump's use of the White House and his official powers during the convention came under widespread criticism on Wednesday, as pundits debated whether the Hatch Act â€” which prohibits executive branch employees from political activity â€” had become a dead letter. But it seems doubtful that the president, who never likes to admit a mistake or that his critics are right, would back down in the face of disapproval. Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff, openly scoffed at the naysayers earlier Wednesday. 'Nobody outside of the Beltway really cares' about the Hatch Act, he said. More likely: With Hurricane Laura bearing down on the Gulf Coast, with protesters shot and killed in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and with the NBA and other professional sports activities suddenly shutting down in protest of police violence, the president and his advisers may have decided it would look frivolous for him to be playing TV host. Wednesday was a bad day in America. Playing entertainer-in-chief would have been a bad look. The president will get back in front of cameras on Thursday, giving his official speech accepting the GOP's nomination for re-election. It never takes long for Donald Trump to find the spotlight.
