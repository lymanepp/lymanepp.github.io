      <title>Jury hears defense cite accuser's email saying 'I love you' years after alleged rape...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Harvey-Weinstein-used-his-power-and-prestige-to-14995261.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK - Women accusing Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault at his criminal trial will have to answer for two realities - the stories they will tell on the witness stand and the starkly different record preserved in emails and other records from before and after the alleged assaults.  That was the argument made by his attorney Damon Cheronis on Wednesday as he presented to the jury emails between Weinstein and the woman he allegedly raped at a Doubletree Hotel in Manhattan in 2013.  Cheronis said accuser Jessica Mann, an aspiring actress, maintained a five-year relationship with the movie tycoon and sent flirty, warm messages throughout. At one point she referred to him as her "casual boyfriend."  "I love you, I always do. But I hate feeling like a booty call. ;)" Mann wrote in a 2017 message to Weinstein - which was put up on a large TV screen at the back of the room in Cheronis' opening statement.  "Ladies and gentlemen, that's not how you talk to your predator," the lawyer said. "That's not how you talk to your rapist."  Cheronis said the district attorney's office wants to convey that the women were "weak" and "couldn't stand up for themselves," that they "were lured in by Harvey Weinstein [and] tricked."  "That's a mirage, and don't take my word for it," the lawyer told the jury.  Weinstein was hunched over at the defense table during his lawyer's moment in the spotlight, chewing his way through a roll of Mentos as Cheronis offered the first official counternarrative to the depiction of Weinstein as a monster and predator that has taken hold in the media since allegations against him started the #MeToo movement in October 2017.  "The truth doesn't change when an article comes out in 2017," Cheronis told the panel, referring to some of the coverage that prompted scores...</description>

      <title>Sanders rifts may help Trump, Dems fear...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Sanders-rifts-may-help-Trump-Democrats-fear-14993595.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;AMES, Iowa - On Tuesday, when Democrats had hoped to focus Americans squarely on President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, many in the party were instead watching in alarm and dismay as a fresh spat erupted between Hillary Clinton and the candidate she defeated in 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders.  In comments published early Tuesday, Clinton left open the possibility that she might not support Sanders if he is the party's nominee. The remarks unleashed fresh angst less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses amid a flurry of other attacks dividing the presidential candidates and their allies.  Sanders, I-Vt., has been engaged in battles with rivals on various fronts over the past week - squabbling with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., over whether he once said a woman could not be president, attacking former vice president Joe Biden with an out-of-context video about Social Security and issuing a rare apology after a top surrogate called Biden corrupt.  The conflicts have reignited Democratic fears that, whoever becomes the nominee, the party will rupture as it did in 2016, when divisions between the Clinton and Sanders camps marred the primaries and the summer convention, and were blamed by many for contributing to her loss to Trump that November.  "Nobody wants to re-litigate 2016. I don't want Democrats focused on the last campaign; I want to focus on the next campaign," said Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and former head of the Democratic National Committee. "People have to check their attacks. We can't get in the mud pit where Donald Trump wants to be. Let's not be playing on his turf."  "If Bernie is the nominee," he added, "everyone has to rally."  Rebecca Katz, a liberal New York-based consultant, put the blame squarely on Clinton.  "This is bringing up...</description>
