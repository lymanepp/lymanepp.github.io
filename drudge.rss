      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/The-many-ways-our-world-could-end-14396877.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man-made fires ravaging huge expanses of the Amazon rainforest have - if only for a brief moment - trained global attention on a looming calamity facing the planet. More people now understand that a series of alarming environmental developments are all linked: A spike in carbon emissions, the rapid melting of Arctic ice, the steady rise of global temperatures, the increasingly erratic and extreme storms assailing coastlines. Every day, we are living in a "dramatic climate emergency," declared U.N. Secretary General António Guterres this week.  But it's not just an evolving climate that poses an existential challenge to humanity. "End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World," a new book by veteran science writer Bryan Walsh that published this week, is a harrowing chronicle of a range of threats that could bring about human extinction in the not-so-distant future. These include eternal dangers to the planet, such as supervolcanoes and asteroids, but also distinctly modern perils - from killer robots and artificial intelligence to civilization-ending nuclear war to weaponized bioengineered super viruses. And then, of course, there's the inexorable toll of man-made global warming, whose effects we're already feeling around the world.  Walsh's book isn't all gloom, taking us to the front lines where researchers and scientists are seeking new ways to protect humanity. His conversation with this column (full disclosure - we were formerly colleagues at Time magazine) was edited for space and clarity.  Q: Is there a degree to which humanity is in greater peril now than it ever was before?  A: Yes, we're in greater existential peril than we've ever been before, because on one hand we have those background risks (volcanoes, asteroids) that have always been with us, but we're introducing new risks into the world, even as...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.houstonchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone knows there's a problem with Chubbs. Dirt is smeared across his face. His tongue is rolling out of his mouth. He's surrounded by signs that say "NO EXCESSIVE BARKING." But the 5-month-old golden retriever does not know how to read. At a dog park in one of Maryland's wealthiest suburbs, he spends this sunny August morning rolling on his back. He opens his mouth, and then, he does it. He woofs. Twice. "CHUBBS!" four humans around him yell, trying to stop him from doing what dogs do - just not in Chevy Chase Village this summer. Here in this community of the rich and powerful, where the average household income is $460,000, barking is the subject of a ferocious (fur-ocious?) debate - one that has divided the two-legged one-percenters for nearly a year. The drama began last fall when the village spent $134,000 to turn a muddy triangle of land into a park where pups could run off-leash in a fenced refuge. Chase tennis balls. Sniff one another's butts. But after about a month, signs decrying the barking of those dogs began appearing around the park. The village police started receiving almost daily calls about the noise, mostly from one particular neighbor whose house backs up to the park. By spring, the tension had escalated so much that the Chevy Chase Village Board of Managers called a public hearing. Then another in June. And another in July. At the center of it all is Elissa Leonard, chair of the village board and wife to Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve. In recent months, her husband has been under attack from President Donald Trump, who appointed him but blames him for the tanking stock market. "My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?" the president tweeted Friday. Leonard, meanwhile, is on the receiving end of...</description>
