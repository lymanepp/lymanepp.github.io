      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Mueller-report-sent-to-attorney-general-13709793.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Special counsel Robert Mueller submitted a long-awaited report to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, marking the end of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.  The submission of Mueller's report ends his closely watched inquiry - a case that has engulfed the Trump administration since its inception, leading to criminal charges against 34 people, including six former Trump associates and advisers.  A senior Justice Department official said the special counsel has not recommended any further indictments - a revelation that buoyed Trump's supporters, even as other Trump-related investigations continue in other parts of the Justice Department. It is also unclear whether a Mueller report that does not result in additional charges could still hurt the president politically.  Justice Department officials notified Congress late Friday that they had received Mueller's report, but they did not describe its contents. Barr is expected to summarize the findings for lawmakers as early as this weekend.  Only a small number of people inside the Justice Department know the document's contents, but it immediately sparked a furious political reaction, with Democrats vying for the presidential nomination in 2020 demanding a public release of the findings and the two top Democrats in Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling for the full report and its "underlying documentation" to be provided to Congress.  Trump's supporters viewed the news as an optimistic indication that he was on the cusp of being vindicated.  "The fact that there are no more indictments is a big deal," said David Bossie, a Trump ally. "This president has had his entire two-year presidency under a...</description>

      <title>DRAMA:  Reporters staking out Mueller; Monitoring lunch, wardrobe...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/830641/mueller-skipping-lunch-dressing-down--reporters-staking-office-are-pumped</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Special Counsel Robert Mueller could wrap up his report any day now. Just ask a group of reporters who've been sitting outside his office for months. As an investigation into possible connections between President Trump's campaign and Russian election interference waged on, journalists â€” namely the so-called #CNNStakeout team â€” have kept an eye on the secretive man at its helm. While they haven't reported any collusion conclusions, they've practically mapped out Mueller's daily schedule â€” and in the last few days, it's seemingly been out of whack. Things started looking fishy last week when Andrew Weissmann, a top member of the Mueller squad, was reported to be headed to a new job. Weissmann even showed up wearing a tan suit, of all things, on Tuesday, while Mueller himself seemed to be dressing more casually, CNN's Evan PÃ©rez said. The obsessive coverage ratcheted up even further on Thursday, when CNN brought an extra-large media crew to Mueller's door, per CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, and caught something big: Mueller didn't leave his office for lunch, as he usually does. While reporters continued to gasp over those implications, CNN's Katelyn Polatz had a few more conclusive signs that something was afoot. As we anticipate the end of Mueller, signs of a wind-down:-SCO prosecutors bringing family into the office for visits-Staff carrying out boxes-Manafort sentenced, top prosecutor leaving-office of 16 attys down to 10-DC US Atty stepping up in cases-grand jury not seen in 2mo â€” Katelyn Polantz (@kpolantz) March 21, 2019 Even bigger news came on Friday: Mueller didn't seem to be in the office at all. Stay tuned to the stakeout feed to see if that means everything â€” or nothing at all.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former DNC chairman Ed Rendell (D-PA) advised 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to look toward the center and not to the far left. "I think all of a sudden, the 2020 election went from a slam dunk for Democrats to something where we're going to have trouble beating this guy because he's going to make Democratic socialism swing to the left, which I don't think is real, but he's going to make it into the issue," the former governor told CNN on Thursday.  "AOC does not speak for the Democratic party," Rendell said of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and her growing influence.</description>

      <title>PRINCETON seminary students asking for reparations for school's role in slavery...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Princeton-seminary-students-are-asking-for-13708289.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Princeton Theological Seminary last year released a report describing its founders' and early faculty's ties to slavery. Now, some of its students want the school to take it a step further and provide reparations as financial restitution for its role in the slave trade.  A group of black seminarians have collected more than 400 signatures in an online petition calling on the New Jersey school to "make amends" by setting aside $5.3 million annually - or 15 percent of what the seminary uses from the school's endowment for its operating expenses - to fund tuition grants for black students and establish a Black Church Studies program.  A progressive seminary like Princeton could be a pioneer by distributing reparations, said Justin Henderson, president of the Association of Black Seminarians, the group behind the petition. The school has confessed and repented for the "sin" of its role in slavery, but "repentance doesn't end with confession," said Henderson, who will finish his master of divinity studies in May.  "Restitution is evidence of the repentance.," he said. "This is how we know the person has repented."  The idea of reparations was popularized by Ta-Nehisi Coates' 2014 cover story in The Atlantic, "The Case for Reparations." It has resurfaced in recent months as an issue in the 2020 presidential race, finding support among Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. They have not revealed specific plans, but those Democratic candidates signaled a shift from other leaders, such as former president Barack Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is running again for the Democratic Party nominee, and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who declined to support reparations in the past.  Princeton's report resulted after a two-year...</description>

      <title>More than half young people don't have romantic partner...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/It-s-not-just-you-New-data-shows-more-than-half-13706291.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Austin Spivey, a 24-year-old woman in Washington, has been looking for a relationship for years. She's been on several dating apps - OkCupid, Coffee Meets Bagel, Hinge, Tinder, Bumble. She's on a volleyball team, where she has a chance to meet people with similar interests in a casual setting. She's even let The Washington Post set her up.  "I'm a very optimistic dater," Spivey says, adding that she's "always energetic to keep trying." But it can get a little frustrating, she adds, when she's talking to someone on a dating app and they disappear mid-conversation. (She's vanished too, she admits.)  Spivey has a lot of company in her frustration, and in her singledom. Just over half of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 - 51 percent of them - said they do not have a steady romantic partner, according to data from the General Social Survey released this week. That 2018 figure is up significantly from 33 percent in 2004 - the lowest figure since the question was first asked in 1986 - and up slightly from 45 percent in 2016. The shift has helped drive singledom to a record high among the overall public, among whom 35 percent say they have no steady partner, but only up slightly from 33 percent in 2016 and 2014.  There are several other trends that go along with the increase in young single Americans. Women are having fewer children, and they're having them later in life. The median age of first marriage is increasing. And according to a 2017 report from the Pew Research Center, among those who have never married but are open to it, most say a major reason is because they haven't found the right person.  Of course, not everyone who's under 35 and single is looking to change that. Caitlin Phillips, a 22-year-old student at the University of Georgia, is open to love if it walked into her life, but she's not actively...</description>
