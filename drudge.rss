      <title>GROWING SECURITY CONCERNS</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/An-intruder-brought-malware-to-Mar-a-Lago-which-13738350.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Presidents used to vacation in seclusion - at a ranch in Texas or a beach house in Hawaii. Screening their visitors was relatively simple: The only people who came were friends and staff.  President Donald Trump has added vast new complications by choosing to spend his weekends with his customers.  Trump stays at the Mar-a-Lago Club, a busy beachfront resort where his quarters are a short distance from the pool, the ballroom and the "six star" seafood buffet. That decision - to use his Palm Beach, Florida, club as both a presidential retreat and a moneymaking resort - brings hundreds of members, overnight guests and partygoing strangers into the president's "Winter White House" every weekend.  To protect the president, that requires the Secret Service to screen hundreds of would-be visitors against preapproved lists.  But to protect his business, it has also required the Secret Service to defer to Mar-a-Lago staffers and allow in some visitors who are not on the list.  Last weekend, that complex system of lists and exceptions broke down.  When a visitor approached the club, officers found she was not on the approved list - but let her in anyway after a Mar-a-Lago staffer suggested she might be the relative of a club member.  The woman, identified as Yujing Zhang, a Chinese national, was later arrested inside the club's main building. Authorities said she was carrying four cellphones, a laptop and a thumb drive with malicious software.  "I'm surprised that she got in. But then again, I'm not surprised," said Shannon Donnelly, the longtime society columnist for the Palm Beach Daily News who has covered Mar-a-Lago for years.  She described a situation in which the Secret Service is dealing with two missions, to keep the president safe and to keep his customers happy.  "It's bound...</description>

      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/Diseases-surge-in-Venezuela-as-health-system-13740280.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Venezuela's health system is in "utter collapse," according to a report, including the exponential spread of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and diphtheria and "dramatic surges" in infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.  The report, to be released Thursday by Human Rights Watch and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, is among the few that has sought to quantify Venezuela's misery, as the country has ceased releasing health and nutrition data and retaliated against those who did.  Based on interviews with doctors and other health personnel in Venezuela, conducted by telephone and online; refugees in Colombia and Brazil, including health care professionals; and representatives of humanitarian and international organizations, the report concludes that the United Nations should take the lead providing aid.  It calls on U.N. Secretary General António Guterres to spearhead efforts to declare a complex humanitarian emergency, an official designation that would trigger a major, comprehensive effort under U.N. auspices and unlock the mobilization of international resources.  Humanitarian aid to Venezuela has been slow, compared with the need, because of the intransigence of President Nicolás Maduro - who has blamed deprivations on U.S. sanctions and refused to allow anything beyond a trickle of assistance to enter the country - and the reluctance of some donors to allow assistance to be distributed by the Maduro government.  A U.N. declaration, the reports' authors say, would put Guterres in a position to press Maduro to allow U.N. agencies to lead and implement a large-scale humanitarian response aid.  Guterres has said the United Nations should not join any of the groups of nations promoting various political solutions to the Venezuelan crisis. They include the Lima Group of 14...</description>
