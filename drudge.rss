      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.washingtontimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunday morning political talk shows have some surprising heritage. It is interesting to note, for example, that NBC’s “Meet the Press” is the nation’s longest running television show, debuting as a half-hour program on Nov. 6, 1947, with serious topics and notable guests — back in the days when anchors spoke in the voice of doom, with an intense demeanor.</description>

      <title>INVESTIGATIONS SWIRL</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/Trump-is-a-huge-headache-for-Deutsche-but-the-14077336.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Investigations surrounding Deutsche Bank's more than decade-long relationship with President Donald Trump and his business have created a crisis for the German financial giant.  It's caught in a legal tug of war between Trump and House Democrats for the president's financial records and calls for broad investigations of its anti-money laundering practices.  But for the 150-year old bank, Trump is just the beginning of its problems.  Once a global powerhouse, catering to the U.S. elite from a tower on Wall Street, Deutsche Bank's fortunes have waned. Sunday, it announced a major restructuring, including ending its global equities business and reducing its investment bank operations.  The restructuring reportedly will mean a reduction of 18,000 jobs by 2022. The news followed an announcement Friday that Deutsche Bank's investment banking chief, Garth Ritchie, was stepping down by mutual agreement.  Shareholders are growing increasingly frustrated by the bank's lackluster profits and growing legal bills. The bank's stock dipped to record lows in recent months, though it has rebounded some recently.  At its annual meeting in Frankfurt, shareholders quizzed company executives for more than nine hours over a series of missteps that have kept the bank under pressure.  "I'm leading a bank that is undoubtedly going through a challenging period," said Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing, who has been at the bank for more than 20 years and became chief executive in 2018. "I want to bring back the pride people feel in working for Deutsche Bank. This is crucial for motivation." Deutsche was prepared to make "tough cutbacks," he told shareholders.  The bank reported a profit for the first time since 2014 last year, but shareholders are still not satisfied.  Deutsche "used to be the biggest...</description>
