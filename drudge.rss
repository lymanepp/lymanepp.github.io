It's a collection point for aid that's supposed to be distributed by backers of Juan Guaido, the congressional leader who is recognized by the U.S. as Venezuela's legitimate president. Previous aid shipments came on commercial planes.</description>

Definitely. "Makeup makes me look pretty," the 7-year-old said on her second visit to the ShuShu &amp; Sassy beauty spa in Seoul. She was wrapped in a child-size pink robe and wearing a bunny hairband. Her face was gently touched up with a puff. Her lips got a swipe of pink gloss. South Korea's cosmetics industry, known as K-beauty, has become an Asian powerhouse and global phenomenon for its rigorous step-by-step regimens. But exacting beauty norms also put enormous pressure on South Korean women, making the country one of the world's centers for plastic surgery.</description>
