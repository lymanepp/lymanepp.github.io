      <title>In Silicon Valley, some men say cosmetic procedures essential to career...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/In-Silicon-Valley-some-men-say-cosmetic-14962007.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lounging at an outdoor cafe just outside downtown San Francisco, his athletic frame filling out a slim-fit button-up, a talkative tech worker named Daniel detailed the many ways he's optimizing his existence.  Only the previous week, he says, he returned from a 10-day trip to Italy's Amalfi Coast. Before that, he boasts, he journeyed to a yoga retreat and juice cleanse in Bali, the perfect setting to unload the stress he absorbs working at a well-known tech company in Silicon Valley. After ending a five-year marriage and shedding 10 pounds of subcutaneous fat several years back - his sun-kissed body now carb- and toxin-free - Daniel has reemerged a new, seemingly younger man.  The changes have enhanced his dating life, but more importantly, he says, they've bolstered his youthful professional image, giving colleagues the impression that he's high-energy, hard-working and on-trend. There's only one problem. Most of Daniel's co-workers think he's in his late 30s, but he's actually 48 years old. As far as Silicon Valley is concerned, his birth date is the tech world's equivalent of prehistory, years before Jobs and Wozniak set up what would become Apple in Jobs's parents' garage.  So like a growing number of male tech workers, Daniel is considering a new strategy to conceal his "advanced" age for years to come: plastic surgery, including Botox, a facelift to counteract under-eye bags and the kind of midsection sculpting that could offer the impression that washboard abs ripple beneath his tailored shirts.  Daniel, who spoke on the condition that only his first name be published for fear of being outed as old, has discussed those procedures with Larry Fan, a San Francisco-based plastic surgeon. Fan estimates that about 25% of his patients now are men like Daniel, the vast majority of whom work in tech. Increasingly, he...</description>

      <title>Trump campaign turns Iran attack into massive FACEBOOK ad blitz...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-campaign-turns-Iran-attack-into-massive-14960107.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Days after President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, the commander in chief's 2020 campaign turned the attack into a political pitch, purchasing roughly 1,000 ads on Facebook that touted his military credentials - and sought to raise money for his reelection push.  The online advertising blitz began late Monday as Trump's team sought to defend the killing of Qasem Soleimani, a major general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Many of the ads solicited personal information from voters that could be useful as the campaign seeks to mobilize voters on Election Day.  The digital strategy mirrors Trump's previous social media campaigns concerning impeachment, immigration and other signature issues, relying on a mix of narrowly targeted messages - along with headline-grabbing tweets seen by millions - to command the political conversation, mobilize his base and advance his policy agenda with an eye on the election. Trump's campaign also alerted supporters with a series of similar text messages highlighting Soleimani's death.  "From a campaign perspective, any time the president accomplishes something - and fighting terrorism is among his biggest campaign promises, keeping our country safe - that is grounds for making the argument that he should be reelected," said Matt Braynard, the data director for Trump's 2016 campaign who says he is not involved in his reelection effort.  But some experts bristled at Trump's tactics in the context of national security, stressing that the stakes are higher than usual: Every ad, tweet and social media statement from Trump carries significant weight in a rapidly developing conflict, they said.  "Growing campaign email lists based on fear and online fundraising for political gain should hardly be a priority of the commander in chief during a...</description>
