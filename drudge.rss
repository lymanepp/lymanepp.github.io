      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, weighs in on the House impeachment inquiry in an interview with FOX News host Martha MacCallum. ERIC TRUMP: This corruption in D.C. is unbelievable. Again, my father said we have the greatest economy in the history of this country. Our country is doing phenomenally well. The Democrats are trying to do everything they can to distract against the fact that we have 3.5% unemployment, the lowest unemployment in the history of this nation. He has done an unbelievable job, Martha.  This is -- I keep on calling it, it's an absolute clown show. This is a clown show because they know they don't have any people left to run against my father in 2020. They know they're going to lose. Nancy Pelosi jumped the gun. She doesn't know what to do at this point. They're floundering in the wind. And honestly, I think if they keep this up, I think it's guaranteeing my father re-election. The fundraising numbers we have coming in right now are out of control.</description>

      <title>ADMITS:  TWITTER misused phone numbers, email addresses for ad targeting... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Twitter-says-users-phone-numbers-provided-for-14502110.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter said Tuesday that it may have mishandled an unspecified number of users' email addresses and phone numbers, allowing that data to be used "inadvertently" for advertising purposes.  The incident marks the latest security mishap for the social-networking company, but one that could carry with it some legal headaches. Federal regulators penalized Facebook earlier this year for a similar situation.  In a blog post, Twitter explained that users share email addresses and phone numbers with the company for safety and login verification purposes, such as two-factor authentication, which allows people to receive a one-time code that they input along with their password in order to access their account.  The trouble, however, stems from the fact that advertisers can upload their own contact lists to match their customers with Twitter's users. In doing so, Twitter said it "may have matched people on Twitter" to a marketer's list "based on the email or phone number the Twitter account holder provided for safety and security purposes."  "We cannot say with certainty how many people were impacted by this, but in an effort to be transparent, we wanted to make everyone aware," Twitter said. "No personal data was ever shared externally with our partners or any other third parties."  The incident could invite trouble for Twitter in Washington, where regulators who investigated and penalized Facebook for a series of privacy scandals took issue with its handling of phone numbers. In that case, the Federal Trade Commission alleged Facebook deceived users because it "did not disclose, or did not adequately disclose" that phone numbers provided through its security tool for the purpose of two-factor authentication "also would be used by Facebook to target advertisements to those users."  Adding to Twitter's potential troubles, the...</description>

You heard talking head after talking head castigate Morey for sending the tweet, speculation over whether he’d keep his job, speculation about the sincerity of his convictions, discussions about what this meant for the Rockets’ bottom line, the observation that it’s unreasonable to expect for-profit companies like the NBA to act morally, and the non-take that cowing to China is simply the cost of doing business in China.</description>

      <title>Turkey rejects Trump threats amid conflicting signals over Syria offensive...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Turkey-rejects-Trump-s-threats-amid-conflicting-14500616.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ISTANBUL - Turkey's vice president said Tuesday that his country would "not react to threats," as it prepared to mount a military offensive against U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters in Syria, a day after President Donald Trump warned that he would destroy Turkey's economy if the offensive did not meet with his approval.  "When it comes to the security of Turkey, as always, our president emphasized Turkey will determine its own path," the vice president, Fuat Oktay, said in a speech at a university in Ankara, the Turkish capital. He referred to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has vowed to create a "safe zone" in a lengthy swath of Syrian territory along Turkey's border.  Erdogan and other Turkish officials have suggested for days that the military operation could begin at any moment. Turkish troop convoys have headed to the border, and local media outlets have published details of what they say is the battle plan. Turkey's Defense Ministry wrote Tuesday on Twitter that all its preparations for the operation were complete.  But there was no sign yet that Turkish troops were moving forward, as the United Nations and aid agencies warned of potentially catastrophic humanitarian consequences, and as the Trump administration delivered confusing signals about how it views Turkey's plans to attack a Syrian-Kurdish force that partnered with the U.S. military to fight the Islamic State militant group.  In a White House statement on Sunday and tweets on Monday, Trump suggested that U.S. troops would step aside as Turkey conducted its military operation.  "It is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home," Trump tweeted. Dozens of U.S. troops were withdrawn from the "safe zone" early Monday.  But after facing harsh criticism from some of his own allies that he was...</description>

      <title>POLL: 3 in 10 REPUBLICANS support impeachment push...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/870332/brutal-new-poll-shows-3-10-republicans-support-trump-impeachment-push</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 58 percent majority of Americans say House Democrats were right to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump, and a 49 percent plurality say the House should vote to remove him from office, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll released Tuesday morning. Support for impeachment has jumped significantly across the board since the White House released a transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in late September. There is a clear partisan split in the results, but 28 percent of Republicans said they support the House impeachment investigation â€” a 21-point jump from a Washington Post/ABC News poll in July â€” and 18 percent of Republicans want the House to "vote to remove Trump from office." Meanwhile, 86 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of independents support the impeachment investigation; 78 percent of Democrats and 49 percent of independents want the House to vote to evict Trump from the White House. There's also a generation gap â€” 40 percent of Republicans age 18-39 back the impeachment investigation versus 23 percent of those 40-64 and 13 percent of Republicans 65 and older. The Post and George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government conducted the poll by phone Oct. 1-6 among 1,007 U.S. adults, and the margin or sampling error for the entire survey is Â±3.5 percentage points. The results were nearly identical for U.S. adults and registered voters. On FiveThirtyEight's aggregate of impeachment polling, which did not include this new poll, 46.5 percent support the impeachment inquiry and 44.7 percent do not. Peter Weber</description>
