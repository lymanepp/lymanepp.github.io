      <title>The backroom deals that saved Andrew Johnson's presidency by single Senate vote...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-backroom-deals-that-saved-Andrew-Johnson-s-15019381.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The impeachment trial was almost over, and Sen. James Grimes was tormented with doubt.  The Iowa senator couldn't stand Andrew Johnson, the belligerent, racist president on trial before the Senate, charged with defying Congress and the law. Johnson was "guilty of a great many follies and wickedness," the mustachioed, mutton-chopped Grimes had written in a letter to his wife.  Grimes feared that if the president were acquitted, he would unleash even more revenge against his enemies and stoke racial violence in the South. But the senator, a moderate Republican, also couldn't stand the impeachers, the radicals trying to tear Johnson from the White House in the name of racial equality. He thought they'd gone too far.  So just before closing arguments began in Johnson's trial in April 1868, Grimes sent messages to Johnson through intermediaries, including one of the president's defense lawyers. If Johnson agreed not to engage in rash acts that might "encourage rebels" in the South, and if he nominated a "secretary of war in whom the country had confidence," Grimes said, "it would help him" - that is, Grimes and other swing-vote senators might vote to acquit Johnson.  So amid the impeachment trial's closing arguments, Johnson sent the Senate a nomination: Gen. John Schofield, Grimes' suggested candidate, for war secretary. That got the senators buzzing.  "During the last 24 hours," another of Johnson's lawyers wrote to the president, "impeachment has gone rapidly astern."  When the nation's first presidential impeachment trial began 152 years ago, Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, was in serious danger of conviction by the Republican-dominated Senate. But the power to end a presidency also created intense pressure on the senators who would cast the deciding votes.  The same pressures...</description>

      <title>In angry America, new remedy emerges: Compassion...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/In-an-angry-America-a-new-remedy-emerges-15017025.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the head of a big-city hospital's emergency department, Susan O'Mara has always focused on providing quick answers to people in crisis: A relative desperate for information. An injured person facing a very long wait. A colleague exhausted from dealing with fed-up patients. But until a special training a few months ago, O'Mara didn't consider whether there were ways to be more compassionate in her response.  The training taught the doctor to pause and listen, and not jump to fix or respond defensively if an angry patient is on the offense. She said it has helped her focus better and find a deeper well of sympathy, even as she deals with trying situations at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in the nation's capital.  "You want to get patients from Point A to Point B with compassion, and also not internalize and feel badly yourself," she said. "To approach someone who is sad, scared, angry - to approach someone who is angry with compassion is the Holy Grail of emergency medicine."  Defined as the ability to notice suffering (in ourselves and others) and then the desire to take action to alleviate it, "compassion" has become the buzzword for an angry nation. It is increasingly being held up by neuroscientists, corporations, business schools and psychologists as a concrete, powerful health strategy - and a successful business model.  Universities have opened centers devoted to compassion. Marianne Williamson and Cory Booker talked about it as an urgent American need during their presidential campaigns. Job networker LinkedIn and wealth manager Brighton Jones both recently created a director of compassion position.  Experts say this shift is the result of new research showing compassion's impact, as well as an urgent desire to address rising rates of depression and anxiety among young people, and a steep climb of rates of...</description>

      <title>GEORGE CONWAY:  Defense is just one big lie... </title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/opinion/article/Trump-s-defense-is-just-one-big-lie-15018316.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The president's lawyers this week floated their catch-all impeachment defense, one tailor-made for President Donald Trump. It is, in essence, that a narcissistic president can do no wrong.  Like most of the president's arguments, it's erroneous. But no argument could have presented the issue more starkly to Republican senators: Will they follow their oaths to defend the Constitution and to do impartial justice? Or will they once again show fealty to Trump personally, thereby accepting his conflation of his personal interests with those of the nation?  The Trump lawyers' challenge to the Senate began with their answer to the very first question from senators. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah asked: What if the president had a mixed motive - if he thought he was acting both "in pursuit of a personal political advantage" and in "promotion of national interests"? White House Deputy Counsel Patrick Philbin responded without caveat. That "cannot possibly be the basis for an impeachable offense," he said.  Leave it to Alan Dershowitz to drive the point home with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. If "a president does something which he believes will get himself elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment," Dershowitz contended.  For a president psychologically incapable of distinguishing between his own personal interests and the nation's, that amounts to the ultimate get-out-of-impeachment-free card. Trump already believes that "I have an Article II" - Article II of the Constitution - "where I have the right to do whatever I want as president." This self-described very stable genius, he of "I alone can fix it," is convinced that his reelection, achieved by whatever means necessary, serves the interests of the...</description>

      <title>Cipollone was camera-shy everyman before trial made him famous...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/entertainment/article/Cipollone-was-a-camera-shy-everyman-before-15018274.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - In August 2016, the conservative pundit Laura Ingraham brought an unassuming, 50-year-old corporate attorney to a presidential debate-prep session for then-candidate Donald Trump.  Long before that day, Ingraham had grown close to Pat Cipollone. He'd been her spiritual mentor as she converted to Catholicism, and he had become her godfather, a special honor in the church meant to forge a lifelong bond. But in her professional world - the realm of high-octane, highly public political combat - Cipollone had made no footprints.  "No one knew who he was," said a person close to Cipollone, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a closed-door campaign gathering.  Here was a Washington everyman, one of the faceless masters of the universe in the capital city who quietly turn the wheels of power, influence, the law and business - pointedly, and by design, without ever generating a headline.  That brief encounter would set in motion one of the more curious pairings in modern American politics, something approaching the knitting of a sinner and a saint. A twice-divorced president with a penchant for extramarital dalliances, name-calling and celebrity magazine spreads aligned with a preternaturally private father of 10 whose great passions trend more to devotional trips to the Vatican and Catholic charitable endeavors.  The impression Cipollone made on the day of Trump's debate prep - the future president and his team viewed this unknown quantity as a man of discretion, of "judgment, intellect and modesty, not a leaker," as one attendee put it - would linger. Nearly 2 1/2 years later, Trump would select Cipollone as his White House counsel and more recently as the lead attorney in the impeachment trial that has played out for the past two weeks in the Senate chamber.  Cipollone's central role in the defense...</description>

Given that there are slightly more than 2 million farms in the U.S., the 2019 bankruptcy data reveals a bankruptcy rate of approximately 2.95 bankruptcies per 10,000 farms, slightly below the rate of 2.99 filings per 10,000 farms in 2011.</description>
