      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enough with the worrying, former Vice President Joe Biden's brain surgeon says. As some voters murmur that the gaffe-prone Democratic presidential candidate's age is cause for extra concern this campaign cycle, Dr. Neal Kassell â€” the man who performed surgery on Biden three decades ago following two brain aneurysms â€” came out swinging for his former patient. Kassell dismissed fears about the 76-year-old Biden's mental faculties, noting that he's "as sharp as he was 31 years ago" and assuring people that the hemorrhage and subsequent operations did not result in any brain damage. "I am going to vote for the candidate who I am absolutely certain has a brain that is functioning," Kassell told Politico. "And that narrows it down to exactly one." Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, backed up Kassell. "Vice President Biden is in excellent physical condition," he said. "He is more than capable of handling the rigors of the campaign and the office for which he is running." In fact, several experts told Politico that voters are placing too great an emphasis on the age of several candidates, particularly the five septuagenarians who are running, including Democratic candidates Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), 77, as well as 73-year-old President Trump and his lone Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who is 74. "They have prospects for survival that extend well beyond the four-year term of the office," said Dr. Jay Olshansky, who led an American Federation of Aging Research study last month that sought to determine how likely it is that a candidate would die while in office. "The bottom line is their chronological age does not matter at all." Read more at Politico. Tim O'Donnell</description>

      <title>Teen arrested for threatening 'slaughter' at abortion clinic...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Teen-arrested-for-threatening-slaughter-at-14362981.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When federal agents arrived last week at Farhan Sheikh's Chicago residence with a search warrant, the 19-year-old suspected they were there because of a "joke" he had posted on a popular meme-sharing platform, according to a complaint unsealed on Monday.  The allegedly humorous post? A threat to "slaughter and murder any doctor, patient, or visitor" at an abortion clinic about four miles from his home, the complaint said.  "I am done with my state and [their] bulls--- abortion laws and allowing [innocent] kids to be slaughtered for the so called 'womans right' bulls---," Sheikh allegedly wrote in one of the posts. "Ive seen nothing but whores go out of the way to get an abortion, but no more. I will not tolerate this anymore. Im DONE. On August 23rd 2019, . . . I will proceed to slaughter and murder any doctor, patient, or visitor i see in the area and I will not back down. consider this a warning for anyone visiting . . ."  In another, he allegedly taunted, "come after me you degenerate government puppets, stop me if you can."  On Monday, Sheikh, who was arrested last week, was charged with transmitting a threat in interstate commerce, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, federal prosecutors in Illinois said in a news release. His arrest is the latest of its kind as law enforcement agencies continue to face heightened scrutiny over how they handle online threats of violence in the aftermath of recent back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.  A lawyer for Sheikh could not be reached for comment early Tuesday.  The FBI began its investigation when threatening messages appeared on iFunny, an online forum, on Aug. 13, the complaint said. The user behind the posts, who went by the name "awarded," was identified as Sheikh, authorities...</description>
