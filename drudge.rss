      <title>Failure to reach trade agreement raises risk of permanent tariffs...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/President-Trump-s-tariffs-once-described-as-13837022.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The failure of the United States and China to reach agreement Friday on a comprehensive trade deal raises the risk that President Donald Trump's favorite negotiating tool - high tariffs on imported goods - may be hardening into a permanent feature of the U.S. economy.  Two days of talks ended Friday with no sign of the agreement that both governments once had predicted would be achieved by this point. After parting company with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pronounced the latest discussions "constructive" but declined to elaborate.  Less than 12 hours earlier, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods had increased to 25% from 10%, in a sign of the president's waning patience with the negotiations.  Trump, who has started the process of imposing tariffs on all remaining U.S. imports of Chinese goods, also issued a flurry of tweets embracing tariffs as his preferred economic policy and hinting that the China levies might linger.  "The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversations . . . into the future will continue. In the meantime, the United States has imposed Tariffs on China, which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations!" the president tweeted.  Trump's enthusiasm for tariffs has been no secret since his calls during his presidential campaign for a 45% tariff on everything Americans buy from China. But his focus on tariffs is a striking departure from the policies pursued by his Democratic and Republican predecessors - especially if he proceeds with his threat to apply tariffs to all $540 billion of annual U.S. purchases from China.  "Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind," he said in an earlier tweet, adding that raising...</description>

      <title>RECORDS SMASHED: WETTEST YEAR IN HISTORY OF USA...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Genuinely-scary-Torrential-rain-in-Houston-13834973.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clusters of violent and slow-moving thunderstorms converged on the Houston area Thursday night, unleashing torrential rain and enormous hail. The deluge wrought havoc on the city, spurring floods reminiscent of Hurricane Harvey in some areas.  And the heavy rain threat is not over.  Houston is under a flash flood watch through Saturday night given the potential for at least one to three additional inches of rain on top of the two to five inches which fell Thursday night and two to three inches Tuesday.  "Soils remain saturated from recent rainfall and many bayous, creeks and rivers remain high so any additional rainfall should run off quickly and cause flooding," the National Weather Service office serving Houston wrote.  Houston is in a slight risk zone for excessive rainfall both Friday and Saturday.  Additional rainfall is not predicted to be as intense as Thursday night's deluge, but the Weather Service urged residents to "stay put" if extreme rainfall returns: "Do not attempt to travel," it warned. "Underpasses and low-water crossings will be life-threatening. If caught in a sinking vehicle, get OUT. Bayous will likely exceed banks and structure flooding could be possible."  By all accounts, Thursday night's storms in Houston, which have left the region susceptible to more flooding, were wild. "This is probably the most hellacious rain I've ever heard in my life," tweeted Matt Lanza, meteorologist for the Houston weather website SpaceCityWeather.com.  The storms left "at least three bayous flowing over the top of their banks, nearly 90,000 residents without power and dozens reportedly trapped for a time in floodwater on Interstate 10," The Washington Post's Timothy Bella reported.  As much as five inches of rain reportedly fell in one hour in east Houston's Greens...</description>

      <title>UBER BUST: 'One of most disappointing IPOs ever'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/840751/uber-having-most-disappointing-ipos-ever</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uber is not having the uberprofitable day it was hoping for. The ride-hailing company set its IPO at $45 per share on Thursday night, but ended up selling at $42 as soon as the market opened on Friday morning. Shares soon fell even lower to $41.06, nearly recovered to their original asking price by mid-day, and dropped once again to point Uber toward one of the worst first-day IPO performances of the decade. Forecasts originally predicted Uber would price itself at $46-$48 per share, though its eventual decision of $45 per share with an $81 billion IPO was still massive. Still, the company never actually saw that set price materialize, and only peaked at $44.74 around 1 p.m. Uber's immediate 6 percent fall after the floor opened makes it one of just 60 companies who've seen a debut day loss of 5 percent or more in the past 10 years, Bloomberg notes. And there's a strong chance it could become the eighth of those companies to actually end up in the red for its first day. Uber has barely gone a day without some kind of public scandal or outcry in the past two years, and this past week was no exception. Drivers for Uber and rival companies went on strike by turning off their apps on Wednesday to protest low wages and a lack of worker benefits. Uber later said it reached settlements with many of the 60,000 drivers who've protested, adding that those settlements would cost upwards of $170 million. The strike was planned to coincide with Uber's first day on the market, though it's unclear if the uproar had anything to do with Uber's dismal performance. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>Who is that guy? Yang draws crowds, money, spot on debate stage...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Andrew-Yang-s-presidential-campaign-draws-crowds-13835027.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;STUART, Iowa - Andrew Yang knows that most Americans have absolutely no idea who he is. Even before he makes his expected debut on the presidential debate stage next month, he has a good guess what viewers will be thinking when the camera shifts to him.  "'Who the hell is that guy?' " said Yang, 44, speaking between stops during a recent campaign swing through Iowa.  He's not wrong. A Taiwanese American entrepreneur, lawyer and philanthropist from New York who launched his long-shot bid for the presidency more than a year ago, Yang is barely a blip in most national polls, where his support ranks between 1 percent and 3 percent.  But Yang has become something of a below-the-radar phenomenon in the crowded field of candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. Some candidates far better known than him have been struggling to catch fire on social media and are playing to smaller audiences; Yang has been packing in some of the largest crowds in the race - an estimated 3,000 in San Francisco; 2,000 in Los Angeles; and 2,500 in Seattle, where he paused the rally to point out a pair of bald eagles soaring overhead.  "It's a sign!" Yang declared, as supporters broke into a chant of "USA! USA! USA!"  While Democratic voters are so far largely embracing conventional politicians, the ability of an outsider like Yang to generate buzz shows how the unsettled political climate that paved the way for Donald Trump's stunning 2016 rise is reverberating in the 2020 contest. Some of the more prominent Democratic candidates have tried to answer voter unease over the economy and the state of the country by staking out positions far more liberal than those held by the party four years ago - but Yang is selling himself as a total disrupter.  He has laid out nearly 80 policy proposals on his website, including his call for the...</description>
