      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, weighs in on the House impeachment inquiry in an interview with FOX News host Martha MacCallum. ERIC TRUMP: This corruption in D.C. is unbelievable. Again, my father said we have the greatest economy in the history of this country. Our country is doing phenomenally well. The Democrats are trying to do everything they can to distract against the fact that we have 3.5% unemployment, the lowest unemployment in the history of this nation. He has done an unbelievable job, Martha.  This is -- I keep on calling it, it's an absolute clown show. This is a clown show because they know they don't have any people left to run against my father in 2020. They know they're going to lose. Nancy Pelosi jumped the gun. She doesn't know what to do at this point. They're floundering in the wind. And honestly, I think if they keep this up, I think it's guaranteeing my father re-election. The fundraising numbers we have coming in right now are out of control.</description>

      <title>ADMITS:  TWITTER misused phone numbers, email addresses for ad targeting... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Twitter-says-users-phone-numbers-provided-for-14502110.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter said Tuesday that it may have mishandled an unspecified number of users' email addresses and phone numbers, allowing that data to be used "inadvertently" for advertising purposes.  The incident marks the latest security mishap for the social-networking company, but one that could carry with it some legal headaches. Federal regulators penalized Facebook earlier this year for a similar situation.  In a blog post, Twitter explained that users share email addresses and phone numbers with the company for safety and login verification purposes, such as two-factor authentication, which allows people to receive a one-time code that they input along with their password in order to access their account.  The trouble, however, stems from the fact that advertisers can upload their own contact lists to match their customers with Twitter's users. In doing so, Twitter said it "may have matched people on Twitter" to a marketer's list "based on the email or phone number the Twitter account holder provided for safety and security purposes."  "We cannot say with certainty how many people were impacted by this, but in an effort to be transparent, we wanted to make everyone aware," Twitter said. "No personal data was ever shared externally with our partners or any other third parties."  The incident could invite trouble for Twitter in Washington, where regulators who investigated and penalized Facebook for a series of privacy scandals took issue with its handling of phone numbers. In that case, the Federal Trade Commission alleged Facebook deceived users because it "did not disclose, or did not adequately disclose" that phone numbers provided through its security tool for the purpose of two-factor authentication "also would be used by Facebook to target advertisements to those users."  Adding to Twitter's potential troubles, the...</description>
