      <title>COSTA:  Some Republicans remain skeptical of pandemic...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Some-in-GOP-remain-skeptical-of-coronavirus-15137350.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the weekend, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., a leading ally of President Donald Trump, dismissed concerns about the novel coronavirus pandemic and said on Fox News that "it's a great time to just go out, go to a local restaurant."  And former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, a Trump supporter who was pardoned last month, tweeted that "this hysteria is being created to destabilize the country and destroy" Trump.  But from Italy, where there is a national quarantine to try to slow the devastating effects of the coronavirus, Newt Gingrich offered a different perspective. The former House speaker wrote an opinion piece seeking to convince his fellow Republicans that not only was the pandemic very real, it required urgent action.  Inside the Republican Party and the conservative movement that Trump commands, there is now a deep divide as the nation confronts the coronavirus. For weeks, many on the right, including Trump, minimized the virus, if they considered it at all. Even in recent days, as much of the world shuts down to try to stop its spread, some Republicans mocked what they saw as a media-generated frenzy.  Their reaction reflected how the American right has evolved under Trump, moving from a bloc of small-government advocates to a grievance coalition highly skeptical of government, science, the news and federal warnings.  Their conspiratorial unrest is particularly acute within right-wing media, where Fox Business removed a prime-time anchor for casting the coronavirus as "another attempt to impeach the president." Other right-wing personalities continue to call the coronavirus a "hoax" or falsely blame George Soros, the billionaire investor and liberal donor, for causing it.  But conservatives and Republicans now face an undeniable reality as the pandemic's death count here and abroad climbs - and...</description>

      <title>Psychologist's science-based tips for emotional resilience... </title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/lifestyle/article/A-psychologist-s-science-based-tips-for-emotional-15135619.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the news about the coronavirus pandemic becomes grimmer, and governments and businesses issue closing or work-from-home directives, many of us are experiencing a variety of negative emotions. We feel anxiety in response to the uncertainty of the situation; sadness related to losing our daily sources of meaning and joy; and anger at whatever forces are to blame for bringing this upon us. As a psychologist, I believe following evidence-based recommendations for bolstering mental resilience can help us weather this crisis.  It's normal to be unsettled and concerned about the upending of life as we know it. "Humans find comfort and safety in the predictability of the routines of daily living," said John Forsyth, a professor of psychology at the University at Albany in New York and co-author of "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Anxiety Disorders." As our lives have dramatically changed overnight, many are struggling with finding ways to deal with the new reality. "We have two children home from college, along with a girlfriend of one, and another high schooler who is distance-learning," said Jane Legg, an elementary school teacher from Bethesda, Maryland. "It's like a lot of people cramped in a small ship, all trying to get their work done."  Many parents of younger children are facing the stress of taking care of them at home, often while teleworking themselves. And families with elderly or sick members are dealing with even stricter isolation in an attempt to prevent covid-19 in this vulnerable population. "I feel especially sad and worried for my elderly mom and aunt who are sequestered in their assisted living facilities," said Larry Eastman, a retired engineer in Ellicott City, Maryland. "And I'm concerned about my dad being isolated, because he's not leaving home."  Nobody knows how long the pandemic will last...</description>

      <title>CASINOS WANT BAILOUT!</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/Casinos-ask-Congress-for-emergency-aid-as-15135870.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Casinos have joined the airline industry in asking Congress for emergency financial help as Las Vegas and other tourist destinations take a severe financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak.  The requested aid for the casino companies, raised by lobbyists in recent days, could come in the form of a comprehensive bailout package, similar to what lawmakers may provide to airlines, cruise companies and the hospitality industry. Other possibilities include direct cash payments, deferred taxes, or special bankruptcy protections, said two people with knowledge of the conversations, who were not authorized to speak publicly.  One person said that on a strategy call Monday with members of the American Gaming Association, which represents the industry, a representative of Wynn Resorts raised the possibility of the industry seeking cash payments. Wynn Resorts was previously run by one of President Donald Trump's biggest political donors, Steve Wynn, though he resigned from his post in 2018. A Wynn Resorts representative did not respond to requests for comment.  The American Gaming Association issued a statement to The Washington Post on Monday, saying that with the $260 billion industry at a "near standstill," additional funds are needed to support casino companies and their employees.  "As state governments close casinos as a part of the urgent public health response to COVID-19, elected leaders should move just as urgently to support the workers and businesses who will bear the brunt of those effects," said the AGA, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. "Our immediate priorities are actions that provide liquidity to allow us to support employees."  The casino industry has been battered by shutdowns related to the coronavirus, with an increasing number of states demanding that all casinos, restaurants and...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Governors across the United States are scrambling to make sure their health care systems have enough respirators to help people diagnosed with the coronavirus, but President Trump surprised them Monday by telling them not wait for the federal government, The New York Times reports. 'Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment â€” try getting it yourselves,' Trump reportedly told the governors during a conference call. He did say the federal government 'will be backing' the states, but, for now, they should try to resolve the issue on their own. 'Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself,' he said. Beyond that, Trump reportedly stayed on course by sounding optimistic amid the pandemic, promising the governors 'we're going to get it remedied and hopefully very quickly.' Trump has invoked some strict travel measures since the outbreak began, but his critics have argued he's been slow to grasp the severity of the situation, leaving the most intense measures to the states.
