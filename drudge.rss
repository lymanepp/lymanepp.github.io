      <title>World's most profitable company pays surprisingly little...</title>
      <link>https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/The-world-s-most-profitable-company-pays-14791896.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.houstonchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;They run the world's most profitable company, oversee one-tenth of global oil output and their decisions help shape the fate of a nation. Their paychecks, however, are a little less grandiose. Saudi oil giant Aramco is a cash cow for the kingdom, allowing the royal family to wield power with a drip-feed of petrodollars. For executives, it's a relatively modest life compared with some of their peers elsewhere. Last year, top management and board members-about 17 people in total-split roughly $30 million worth of compensation and benefits. That was half of what rivals Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. handed their executives and directors, though they would have been subject to income tax whereas Saudi nationals aren't. Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser collected no more than a $5 million package in 2016 as the company began preparing its protracted initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said. That was less than a fifth of what Exxon's then-CEO Rex Tillerson received at the time. Even when taking into account the tax regime and other perks like secluded housing with private pools, the numbers are hardly staggering compared with the grand plan for the company. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants Aramco valued at a spectacular $2 trillion when the government eventually sells shares in it, the centrepiece of the biggest economic transformation since the firm was brought under state control in the 1970s. Inside the C-suite, senior executives for decades have been schooled in the mantra that long-term success trumps all other priorities. It's about the future of the kingdom, not personal enrichment. "This is the lifeblood of Saudi Arabia," said Ellen Wald, who runs her own energy and political consulting firm and is author of the 2018 book...</description>

      <title>Bezos would pay  $7 BILLION in tax with Warren's Medicare-for-all!</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/875830/jeff-bezos-pay-nearly-7-billion-elizabeth-warrens-medicareforall-tax</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has a plan for taking Jeff Bezos' money. The 2020 candidate unveiled her proposal Friday to pay for her estimated $34 trillion Medicare-for-all plan without upping taxes on the middle class. It relies on a big chunk of change from the country's biggest earners, and would end up costing the Amazon founder nearly $7 billion. To raise the tremendous sum needed to provide universal health care, Warren laid out a $20.5 trillion tax package that she says targets "the financial sector, large corporations, and the top 1 percent." Bezos squarely falls under that last category, and he'd be subject to Warren's wealth tax that was upped in this plan from two percent to six percent. And six percent of Bezos' $111.7 billion net worth? That's about $6.7 billion. Joining Bezos at the top of the pile is Bill Gates, who would put in around $6.4 billion, and Warren Buffett, who'd contribute closer to $5 billion. Bezos' company would also end up paying heftier taxes, though it won't have to worry about providing them with health care anymore. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
