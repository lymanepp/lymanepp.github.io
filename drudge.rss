      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The Latest on Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison's response to an allegation of domestic abuse (all times local): 12:20 p.m. Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison says he won't abandon his run for Minnesota attorney general amid allegations from an ex-girlfriend that he once physically abused her, "because I didn't do it." Ellison made his most expansive comments about the allegations Friday before joining supporters for a campaign outreach event in Minneapolis. Karen Monahan has accused the six-term congressman of dragging her from a bed while screaming at her in 2016. She has claimed to have video but says she won't release it.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The publisher of former Donald Trump aide Omarosa Manigault Newman's explosive new book on Wednesday issued a defiant rebuttal to what it described as "hollow legal threats" from a Trump campaign attorney. The gist of the message: We will not be silenced. "Mr. Trump is the President of the United States, with a 'bully pulpit' at his disposal," Simon &amp; Schuster outside counsel Elizabeth McNamara said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post. "To the extent he disputes any statements in the Book, he has the largest platform in the world to challenge them." Simon &amp; Schuster, McNamara added, "will not be intimidated by hollow legal threats and have proceeded with publication of the Book as scheduled.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALEXANDRIA, Va. - Jurors weighing the fate of President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort ended its first day of deliberations Thursday with a set of questions for the judge, asking for further explanation of legal points the defense made in closing arguments. Just before 4:50 p.m., there was a knock at one of the doors to U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis' courtroom, behind which jurors are deliberating. The court security officer emerged minutes later with a note. Jurors had four questions, some of which centered around defense arguments made by Manafort's lawyers. Manafort faces 18 tax and bank fraud charges.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.theintelligencer.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOSCOW (AP) - The Russian military says that two nuclear-capable strategic bombers have flown to the easternmost Chukotka Peninsula, near Alaska, as part of an air force exercise. The Russian Defense Ministry said that the Tu-160 bombers flew about 7,000 kilometers (4,350 Miles) from their home base near Saratov in southwestern Russia to Anadyr, on Chukotka, before returning to their home base. The ministry said the mission was the first time the bombers had flown to Chukotka, which faces Alaska across the Bering Strait. The ministry said the air force exercise also involved the Tu-95 strategic bombers and tanker planes. The Russian military has increased the intensity and scope of its drills amid strain in relations with the U.S.</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Senate-confirms-the-25th-and-26th-appellate-13161552.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Senate on Thursday confirmed the 25th and 26th appellate court judges during President Donald Trump's tenure, as Republicans continued reshaping the federal judiciary at a record clip. The Senate approved A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr. by a vote of 62 to 28, and backed Julius Ness Richardson on a vote of 81 to 8. Both will join the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. The GOP-controlled Senate has been approving appellate court judges at a rapid pace, already setting a record for the most confirmed during a president's first two years in office. GOP leaders are installing jurists favored by conservatives who are likely to influence decisions on immigration, voting rights, abortion and the environment for decades.</description>
