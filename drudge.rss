      <title>CHINA ACTIVATES HEALTH CODES ON SMARTPHONES...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Summer-in-Beijing-Hot-and-oppressive-but-almost-15428177.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIJING - All the signs of Beijing's infernal summer are in evidence. Men playing cards on the sidewalks are sporting their "Beijing bikinis," their shirts hoisted up over their beer bellies for better air flow, while young trendy types carry personal fans as they walk down the street.  People are cooking meat at outdoor restaurants or on little grills on the sidewalk. It's so hot that Beijingers - usually insistent on body-temperature beverages - are even drinking their beer cold.  It could almost be any other steamy July in any other year.  But even here, where life is almost back to normal after months of strict controls, the coronavirus remains a lingering menace, lurking behind the quotidian veneer.  Restaurants and malls are open, but to enter, customers have to activate a health code on their smartphones. The code tracks their movements and determines whether they have been to any risky places. Only those with green codes are allowed in. Many offices insist on green codes, too. A red code, or even an amber one, is the scarlet letter of 2020.  You can have concerns about privacy, or you can have a functioning life. You can't have both.  Security guards with temperature guns man the gates at supermarkets and residential compounds, pointing them at the wrists of every person who wants to enter. This is largely a formality, as the reading often does not reflect reality. This reporter has recorded temperatures in the low 80s on several occasions, yet was alive enough to walk through the gate.  Gyms are open, but only if they are above ground. Movie theaters on Monday turned the lights back on, but at 30 percent capacity and with no eating or drinking allowed. Beijing's main tourist attractions, such as the Forbidden City, require advance reservations, and masks are...</description>

      <title>MAG: Live sports becoming video games...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/927132/pandemic-accelerating-video-gamification-sports</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you 'take me out with the crowd' when there's a global pandemic? By filling the stadium with people who can't get sick. Fox Sports announced Thursday that its broadcasts of Major League Baseball games this season will utilize 'cutting-edge' technology to populate the stands with 'virtual fans.' The Sims-like creations will wear their teams colors and thin out if the game is a blowout. They'll cheer, boo, and â€” abominably â€” even do the wave. If Fox's intention was to make empty stadiums less eerie, they've definitely failed. But its choice represents an even bigger shift in professional sports: the creep toward becoming more and more like video games. No fans? Not on FOX Sports. Thousands of virtual fans will attend FOXâ€™s MLB games this Saturday. pic.twitter.com/z9oQU0rYuC â€” FOX Sports (@FOXSports) July 23, 2020 Sports and video games have been in conversation with each other for decades; 1958's Tennis for Two, played on an oscilloscope, is considered one of the first video games ever. But while electronic games used to be more influenced by live sports, that relationship has shifted thanks to advances in television graphics, made possible in part by 'a new wave of high-resolution cameras and smart algorithms,' Fast Company reports. Since ESPN debuted in-game box scores in the mid-'90s, networks have tried to cram screens with as many angles and statistics as possible â€” much like the stat bars and camera toggles available in a video game. The push for electronic strike zones also pursues the mechanical perfection of a video game: a pitch either is or isn't a strike in the eyes of a computer, leaving no room for subjectivity or the delightful randomness of human error. The use of digital avatars in the place of human fans seems to take this to a Philip K. Dick extreme: Why involve real people at all, who might run onto the field, look bored on camera, or interfere with the game, when you can replace them with a sea of faces right out of MLB: The Show? Of course, there's an extreme beyond even digital fans: That the players themselves could eventually be replaced by algorithms, where stats are crunched in simulations, so no games need to be played at all (it would certainly save teams some money). That might sound laughably impossible â€” but hey, so would have a 60-game MLB season played in empty stadiums just six months ago. Jeva Lange</description>

      <title>What would happen if Trump refused to accept loss?</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Trump-s-assault-on-election-integrity-forces-15426993.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's relentless efforts to sow doubts about the legitimacy of this year's election are forcing both parties to reckon with the possibility that he may dispute the result in November if he loses - leading to an unprecedented test of American democracy.  With less than four months before the election, Trump's escalating attacks on the security of mail-in ballots and his refusal again this week to reassure the country that he would abide by the voters' will have added urgency to long-simmering concerns among scholars and his critics about the lengths he could go to hold on to power.  "What the president is doing is willfully and wantonly undermining confidence in the most basic democratic process we have," said William Galston, chair of the Brookings Institution's Governance Studies Program. "Words almost fail me - it's so deeply irresponsible. He's arousing his core supporters for a truly damaging crisis in the days and weeks after the November election."  Most legal experts said it is hard to envision that Trump would actually try to remain in office after a clear defeat by former vice president Joe Biden, considering the uproar that would follow such a challenge to U.S. democratic norms. Trump has previously said he offers up inflammatory ideas to provoke the media and his critics.  But his unwillingness to commit to a smooth transition of power has forced academics and political leaders - including, privately, some GOP lawmakers - to contemplate possible scenarios.  The resulting turmoil could surpass the contention over the outcome of the 2000 presidential election, confounding the legal system, Congress and the public's faith in how the country picks its leaders. Such a crisis could also have long-lasting consequences for a nation that has already been rocked this year by the coronavirus pandemic,...</description>
