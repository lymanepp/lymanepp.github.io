      <title>Longtime NY congressman tries to fend off challenger from left...</title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Longtime-N-Y-congressman-tries-to-fend-off-15354455.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MAMORONECK, N.Y. - Standing outside a firehouse here, as 10,000 donated face masks were delivered, Rep. Eliot Engel confronted the questions that had put his 31-year congressional career in jeopardy.  How did the longest serving New York congressman suddenly face complaints of ignoring his district? How did Jamaal Bowman, a former middle school principal who has never run for office, turn Tuesday's Democratic primary into a pitched battle over who cared more about the north Bronx and southern swath of Westchester County?  "It's a farce," Engel said. "People know I bring millions of dollars home from Washington. I know virtually everybody in the district. If there are three people in a room and I'm invited, I'm there."  Two years after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., stunned the political establishment and unseated Joseph Crowley, then the fourth-ranked House Democrat, Engel is trying to fend off the same insurgency from the left. The House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman knew it was coming and has welcomed the help, from the endorsements of Hillary Clinton, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and top congressional Democrats to Republican donors funding a super PAC that backs him.  "I'm grateful to anyone who supports me," said the 73-year-old Engel.  A victory for Engel would humble his party's growing left wing after its favored candidates came up short in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. A defeat would reveal the limits of a party establishment that, just a few years ago, could keep its incumbents safe with a simple premise: You know them, so why not keep them?  "It's like B.C. and A.D. - before AOC and after AOC," said Ritchie Torres, a liberal state legislator running in the 15th District, which neighbors Engel's. "In the post-AOC world, incumbency is no longer an entitlement, no longer a guarantee of...</description>

      <title>PURGE:  Barr replaces Manhattan U.S. Attorney who was probing Rudy...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Trump-administration-replaces-Manhattan-U-S-15353719.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Trump administration announced Friday night that Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, whose office has handled a number of investigations involving the president or his campaign, will be leaving that job.  Attorney General William Barr announced the change, saying the president plans to nominate the current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, for the job.  Berman's office has been conducting a criminal investigation of President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in a campaign finance case that has already led to charges against two of Giuliani's associates.  While the Senate considers Clayton's nomination, Barr said, the job will be filled by Craig Carpenito, who currently serves as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Carpenito will take over the job on July 3, Barr said.  "Geoff has done an excellent job leading one of our nation's most significant U.S. Atorney's Offices, achieving many successes on consequential civil and criminal matters," Barr said in his statement.  The reasons behind Berman's departure were not immediately clear. A spokesman for Berman did not immediately comment. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan handle some of the most sensitive financial, political and national security cases in the Justice Department, and Berman's office has a long tradition of charting its own course on high-profile cases.  The office has filed campaign finance charges against two Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, accusing them of conspiracy and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission.  People familiar with the case have said investigators are scrutinizing Giuliani's consulting business and eyeing donations made to America First Action, the main pro-Trump super PAC set up by his advisers and...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.houstonchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TULSA, Okla. - Tulsa was a city on edge Friday night, as Donald Trump fans and counter protesters gathered in anticipation of the president's first campaign rally in months set for Saturday, raising fears of a violent confrontation and a worsening spread of the coronavirus as local cases spike. Authorities set up perimeter around the 19,000-seat BOK Center in downtown Tulsa, where those eager to see Trump started lining up at midweek. Businesses around the area boarded up their windows, the mayor issued a state of emergency and set up a curfew out of concern that outside groups were headed to town to raise trouble. But the city announced it was rescinding the safety measures after Trump tweeted: "I just spoke to the highly respected Mayor of Tulsa, G.T. Bynum, who informed me there will be no curfew tonight or tomorrow for our many supporters attending the #MAGA Rally," Trump said. "Enjoy yourselves - thank you to Mayor Bynum!" The surprise decision threw another dose of chaos into the mix, as Trump moved forward to stage a rally that was controversial on two fronts. Not only did it come in a racially torn city at a fraught moment, but it flouted health guidelines that recommend against mass gatherings amid the coronavirus epidemic, with opponents of the rally on health grounds unsuccessfully pressing their objections at the state Supreme Court. Outside the perimeter of the center Friday, Trump fans were already chanting "All lives matter" at one counter protester chanting and waving a "Black lives matter" sign. About a mile from the arena, thousands more people gathered Friday for the emancipation celebration of Juneteeth in the historic black community of Greenwood, once known as Black Wall Street, where an estimated 300 black residents were killed by a white mob...</description>

      <title>PRESIDENT WARNS REPUBLICANS TO STAY LOYAL</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/921059/trump-warns-senate-republicans-stay-loyal-dont-embrace-theyre-going-lose</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump has a 'love it or leave it' mentality for the Republican Party. In an interview with Politico published Friday, Trump showed a 'rare admission of concern' when it came to winning back the presidency this fall and retaining a GOP Senate majority. And the key to mitigating that concern, he said, was to keep every Republican senator in line, issuing a stern warning for anyone who dares break ranks. 'If they don't embrace, they're going to lose, because, you know, I have a very hard base. I have the strongest base people have ever seen,' Trump told Politico. Trump's aides, including his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, are apparently enforcing this ultimatum. Potential targets of this threat could include Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who said she hasn't decided whether to support Trump in 2020, and Michigan GOP Senate candidate John James, who has told voters he disagrees with Trump on 'plenty, plenty of issues.' Trump recently met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to discuss Senate Republicans' re-election strategies, and seems to want to use his popularity to encourage party loyalty in all of them. For example, when Trump was handed a document during the interview comparing his and Senate candidates primary results, he specifically noted his 98 percent vote in North Carolina. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is considered at risk of losing this fall, got 78 percent of his primary vote. He then listed some GOP senators who broke ranks with him in 2018 and ended up being voted out: Arizona's Jeff Flake and Nevada's Dean Heller, to name a few. Read more, including what Trump thinks is his 'biggest risk' in 2020, at Politico. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
