      <title>Washington National Cathedral report corroborates allegations of sex misconduct by 16 adults against students over decades...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Washington-National-Cathedral-report-corroborates-14056636.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - An investigation launched by Washington National Cathedral and three affiliated District of Columbia private schools corroborated allegations of sexual misconduct by 16 former employees involving students decades ago, officials said Thursday.  A 19-page summary of the investigation released by the cathedral, St. Albans School, the National Cathedral School and the Beauvoir School said the investigation had substantiated allegations of misconduct mostly during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, with the most recent corroborated incident dating back eleven years."  In a letter to parents, officials from the institutions said that no allegations involving current employees were found but that the investigation found "incidents from our past that are deeply troubling" and involving "16 former adult members of our community."  "We take responsibility and offer a sincere apology for the abuse of trust and betrayal of innocence caused by former adult members of this community in decades past," the letter said.  The letter added that "for all adults credibly accused of sexual misconduct against students, we have made reports to law enforcement and to employers where the adults might have had access to children."  The investigation was initiated by St. Albans in February after The Washington Post reported allegations that former teacher Vaughn Keith sexually abused a student at another private school in the 1970s and was fired for alleged sexual misconduct.  Keith was named in a January report commissioned by Key School in Annapolis, Marylandm that corroborated allegations against him, including those of a woman who said he sexually abused her while she was a student. He went on to teach Latin and classical history at St. Albans for six years in the 1980s and...</description>

      <title>Marianne Williamson Hopes For Spiritual Healing...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/lifestyle/article/Marianne-Williamson-won-t-make-you-feel-better-14056689.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author Marianne Williamson has spent a good portion of her career standing in front of troubled audiences and speaking to them in tones that are soothing, admonishing and invigorating. She has written best-selling books aimed at helping people get their spiritual lives in order and part of that process includes exploring their own culpability in their predicament.  Williamson has brought a similar sense of self-examination to her presidential campaign which is, at this early stage, a massive long shot, but not quite as quixotic as those stragglers who couldn't even meet the first debate's qualifying standards: attract 65,000 individual donations or register 1 percent support in three polls. Williamson did both. She will not be center stage in Miami Thursday night - that spot is reserved for former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, who are leading in the polls. She may not be knee deep in legislative experience or wonky verbiage, but she can be both charismatic and intriguing on the stump. She is a palate cleanser.  Williamson is not new to campaigning. She ran for Congress in 2014 as an independent. She lost. Mostly, she is known for books such as "A Return to Love," as an adviser to Oprah Winfrey and part of the media mogul's Super Soul Sunday series.  Williamson stands out in a lineup with other candidates. They hand-chop the air like dark-suited lumberjacks, reflexively smile even when there is nothing in particular to smile about and pace the stage as if mileage equals substance. Williamson speaks in a husky alto with a cadence that is part meditation guide and part preacher. Her gestures are smooth elucidation, rather than a series of exclamation points. She does not plod across the stage; she alights upon it. She is not here to brag about herself; she is here to help you bring forth your best...</description>
