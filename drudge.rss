      <title>PAPER: Senate likelier to remove than think...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/The-Senate-is-likelier-to-remove-Trump-after-14514050.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the House of Representatives builds momentum to impeach President Donald Trump, conventional wisdom holds that the constitutionally required two-thirds vote in the Senate to remove him would be impossible.  This conventional wisdom is wrong.  While getting rid of the president this way remains far from certain, it's more likely than most observers will admit. And it's becoming a stronger possibility day by day as Trump's foreign policy stumbles remind GOP senators that speaking out against the president doesn't have to be political suicide.  Historically inclined naysayers cite the acquittals of our only two impeached presidents as support for the argument that Trump won't be removed. Those examples, both of which ended with the commander in chief beating the charges against him and serving out his full term, on first blush do appear to bolster that case.  Andrew Johnson's experience in particular astounds to this day. After that president's egregious behavior and manifest unfitness for office got him impeached by the Republican-dominated House in 1868, the Senate failed to remove him from office - by one vote. That result came despite the GOP holding a greater-than-two-thirds majority in the Senate.  The wrong lesson, however, can be taken from Johnson's nonconviction. Senators allowed the president to remain in place partly because they suspected the law that the president had violated to prompt his impeachment, the Tenure of Office Act, itself stood on particularly shaky ground. (It was, in fact, later ruled unconstitutional.) Other articles of impeachment against Johnson included "crimes" like speaking ill of Congress in public - which may very well have contravened a lingering norm from the early days of the republic but fell very well short of warranting immediate ejection from the presidency.  It's hard to...</description>

      <title>Farmers kept refusing to let him have sex with their animals. So he sought revenge...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Farmers-kept-refusing-to-let-him-have-sex-with-14514093.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For well over a year, two mysteries consumed a peaceful New Jersey community. There were the strange letters that showed up in the mailboxes of local barns, asking about the possibility of forming a "sexual relationship" with horses, cows or other large animals. And then, there were the homemade tire-slashing devices that farmers kept finding in their driveways, or near the entrances to rural farm roads.  Now, authorities in Sussex County, New Jersey, are saying that both were the work of the same man, Richard Decker, who lashed out by harassing people who refused to let him have sex with their farm animals.  The 31-year-old was arrested Oct. 3, according to the New Jersey Herald. Prosecutors said at a Wednesday detention hearing that since August 2018, he had been sending letters and emails detailing his request to farms, stables and horse boarding facilities throughout Sussex County, located in the northernmost point of the state. Unsurprisingly, many of the recipients were not thrilled to learn than an adult man was interested in having a sexual relationship with their livestock.  Decker didn't take the rejection well, authorities said on Wednesday. He left messages harassing the property owners who had turned him down - in one instance threatening to beat a man's wife with a wooden stick - and wrote negative online reviews of their businesses. The 31-year-old also allegedly kept a stash of homemade metal tire deflation spikes in his bedroom, and would plant them in the driveways of farmers who angered him.  In January, police in Decker's hometown of Vernon Township, New Jersey, issued a warning to "anyone who has farm-like property" after several residents found that their tires had been destroyed by homemade spikes, which are also known as caltrops. The department's Facebook post was deluged with comments from...</description>
