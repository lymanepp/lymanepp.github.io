      <title>LINCOLN PROJECT drops bombshells into anti-Trump ad on China...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/920729/lincoln-project-already-dropped-john-boltons-bombshells-into-antitrump-ad-china</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Say what you want about the conservative anti-Trump super PAC the Lincoln Project, but they are quick on the draw. Reporters started revealing scandalous tidbits from former National Security Adviser John Bolton's tell-all about his time in President Trump's White House on Wednesday, and it didn't take more than a few hours for the Lincoln Project to use one of Bolton's biggest bombshells in a new ad arguing that Trump is continually losing against China â€” or at least the United States is losing under Trump's dealmaking skills. China knows 'who Donald Trump is â€” weak, corrupt, ridiculed,' the ad claims. 'China beats him every time. No matter what he says, China's got his number. Trump even begged Chinese leader Xi to help him win re-election, like a dog.' The gratuitous 'like a dog' is the Lincoln Project's addition, but the begging for re-election help is from Bolton's copious notes. Trump has made clear in his own campaign ads, tweets, and public statements that he hopes to hit former Vice President Joe Biden as soft on and subservient to China. Yes, Trump publicly asked China to investigate the Bidens, but he has also 'spent months claiming China is secretly working to help his opponent,' Jonathan Chait writes at New York. 'It seemed as if Trump's motivation for leveling this baseless charge was deflection. ... But it turns out Trump's actual motive was projection.' Peter Weber</description>

      <title>Trump campaign runs ads with marking once used by Nazis to designate political prisoners...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-campaign-runs-ads-with-marking-once-used-by-15349154.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In its online salvo against antifa and "far-left mobs," President Donald Trump's reelection campaign is displaying a marking once used by the Nazis to designate political prisoners in concentration camps.  The red inverted triangle was first used in the 1930s to identify Communists, and was applied as well to Social Democrats, liberals, Freemasons and other members of opposition parties. The badge forced on Jewish political prisoners, by contrast, featured a red inverted triangle superimposed on a yellow triangle.  A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The symbol appeared in Facebook ads run by Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, as well as the "Team Trump" account on Facebook. It was featured alongside text warning of "Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups" and asking users to sign a petition about antifa, a loose collection of anti-fascist activists whom the Trump administration has sought to tie to recent violence, in spite of arrest records showing their involvement is trivial.  Other variations of the ads use a yield sign, which has the same shape and a similar color scheme but is notably distinct in only featuring a red outline and a white interior. Some of the material also features a stop sign.  "I think it's a highly problematic use of a symbol that the Nazis used to identify their political enemies," said Jacob Eder, a historian of modern Germany at the Barenboim-Said Akademie in Berlin. "It's hard to imagine it's done on purpose, because I'm not sure if the vast majority of Americans know or understand the sign, but it's very, very careless to say the least."  Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, a progressive advocacy group, condemned the use of the notorious symbol in campaign advertising.  "This isn't just one post,"...</description>

      <title>Dangerous threat emerges from Boogaloo movement...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/As-Trump-warns-of-leftist-violence-a-dangerous-15347940.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A far-right extremist movement born on social media and fueled by anti-government rhetoric has emerged as a real-world threat in recent weeks, with federal authorities accusing some of its adherents of allegedly working to spark violence at largely peaceful protests roiling the nation.  At a time when President Donald Trump and other top U.S. officials have claimed - with little evidence - that leftist groups were fomenting violence, federal prosecutors have charged various supporters of a right-wing group, which calls itself "the Boogaloo Bois," with crimes related to plotting to firebomb a U.S. Forest Service facility, preparing to use explosives at a peaceful demonstration and killing a security officer at a federal courthouse.  Prosecutors even successfully argued before a federal magistrate in Texas over the weekend that a drug possession suspect with alleged Boogaloo ties should be denied bond because Facebook and Instagram posts he'd made advocating violence against National Guardsmen and threatening to kill looters showed he was a "threat to the community."  The Boogaloo are more of a violent anti-government ideology than a formal movement, say those who study extremist groups. They say they cannot identify a leader, headquarters or command structure, just loosely affiliated social media pages ranging from explicitly violent to merely commercial, peddling Boogaloo-themed merchandise.  But the visibility of Boogaloo supporters at recent protests - dressed in trademark Hawaiian shirts and carrying assault rifles - had alarmed researchers who for months had warned about the danger the group posed.  Now federal prosecutors in California, Texas, Nevada and Colorado appear to be endorsing those concerns with a series of criminal charges against self-described Boogaloo supporters, whose arrests often were...</description>

      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Trump-asked-China-s-Xi-to-help-him-win-15347229.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to help him win the 2020 U.S. election, telling Xi during a summit dinner last year that increased agricultural purchases by Beijing from American farmers would aid his electoral prospects, according to a damning new account of life inside the Trump administration by former national security adviser John Bolton.  During a one-on-one meeting at the June 2019 Group of 20 summit in Japan, Xi complained to Trump about China critics in the United States. But Bolton writes in a book scheduled to be released next week that "Trump immediately assumed Xi meant the Democrats. Trump said approvingly that there was great hostility among the Democrats.  "He then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming U.S. presidential election, alluding to China's economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win," Bolton writes. "He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome. I would print Trump's exact words but the government's prepublication review process has decided otherwise."  At the same meeting, Xi also defended China's construction of camps housing as many as 1 million Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang - and Trump signaled his approval.  "According to our interpreter," Bolton writes, "Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do."  The episode described by Bolton in his book, "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," bears striking similarities to the actions that resulted in Trump's impeachment after he sought to pressure the Ukrainian president to help dig up dirt on Democratic rival Joe Biden in exchange for military assistance. The China allegation also comes amid ongoing...</description>

      <title>Biden calls revelations 'morally repugnant'...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Joe-Biden-reacts-to-allegations-against-Trump-in-15348038.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former vice president Joe Biden released a scathing statement Wednesday, describing President Donald Trump's actions as alleged in former national security adviser John Bolton's new book as "morally repugnant" and accusing the president of ignoring the coronavirus threat to keep his trade deal with China alive.  Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to challenge Trump in November, reacted to Bolton's claim that Trump tried to convince Chinese President Xi to increase imports from American farmers because it would be good for his reelection prospects.  "He was willing to trade away our most cherished democratic values for the empty promise of a flimsy trade deal that bailed him out of his disastrous tariff war that did so much damage to our farmers, manufacturers, and consumers," Biden said in a statement.

Biden then linked Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic to his desire for a finished trade deal with Xi for political leverage. It's why, Biden posits, that Trump continued to praise the Chinese government and downplay the threat even as the coronavirus began to spread.  America has "been hurt far worse because of Donald Trump's inability to lead and his failure to meet the crisis." Biden said. "Today we learned more about the depth and nature of that failure," Biden added.  Missing from his lengthy statement is reaction to Bolton essentially confirming the charges leveled by Democrats against Trump during the impeachment inquiry. Biden unwittingly became a central figure in that probe as it centered around Trump freezing military aid to Ukraine to pressure that country to launch an investigation into Biden and his son,...</description>
