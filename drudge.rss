      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.cnn.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In hundreds of highly classified phone calls with foreign heads of state, President Donald Trump was so consistently unprepared for discussion of serious issues, so often outplayed in his conversations with powerful leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan, and so abusive to leaders of America's principal allies, that the calls helped convince some senior US officials -- including his former secretaries of state and defense, two national security advisers and his longest-serving chief of staff -- that the President himself posed a danger to the national security of the United States, according to White House and intelligence officials intimately familiar with the contents of the conversations.</description>

      <title>Americans living in big 'anger incubator'...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Americans-are-living-in-a-big-anger-incubator-15376110.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Americans are angry. The country erupted into the worst civil unrest in decades after the death of George Floyd, and anger about police violence and the country's legacy of racism is still running high. At the same time, we're dealing with anger provoked by the coronavirus pandemic: anger at public officials because they've shut down parts of society, or anger because they aren't doing enough to curb the virus. Anger about being required to wear a mask, or anger toward people who refuse to wear a mask. Anger with anyone who doesn't see things the "right" way.  "We're living, in effect, in a big anger incubator," said Raymond Novaco, a psychology professor at the University of California at Irvine, who has expertise in anger assessment and treatment.  According to psychiatrist Joshua Morganstein, the country is now dealing with "three disasters superimposed on top of one another": the pandemic, the economic fallout and civil unrest. "Certainly, one way of responding, and a common way of responding, is anger," said Morganstein, who chairs the American Psychiatric Association's Committee on the Psychiatric Dimensions of Disaster.  Surveys over the past few years suggested that anger had risen in the country even before the 2020 crises. A Gallup poll conducted in 2018, for example, concluded that Americans' stress, worry and anger had intensified that year. Twenty-two percent of Americans had felt anger the previous day, up from 17 percent the previous year.  The emergency weekly surveys conducted since April by the Census Bureau and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention don't ask specifically about anger. But they reveal that many Americans are anxious or depressed - especially black and Asian Americans in the week following George Floyd's death. Both anxiety and depression can manifest as anger.  Anger is also an...</description>

      <title>Fed driving savers to riskier investments...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/How-the-Fed-is-driving-savers-to-riskier-15375915.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Federal Reserve is getting lots of love from the financial markets because it's lowered the short-term rates that it controls to just about zero, and has figured out inventive ways to drive long-term rates to ultralow levels and get some formerly troubled parts of the financial system working smoothly again.  The stock market has risen sharply in the past three months, in large part because of the Fed, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index erasing most of the terrifying 34 percent, five-week drop that it suffered from its mid-February all-time high to its March 23 low.  And even though retail sales are still well below where they were before the pandemic struck and the unemployment rate is much higher, they're are a lot better than they were not long ago, in large part because of the stimulus created by ultralow interest rates and various pieces of bailout legislation.  But despite the benefits that our economy and stock market have gotten from the Fed, I've got a problem with the "We're not even thinking about thinking about raising rates (for the next few years)" policy of Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell.  And with the fact that ultralow rates have made it much cheaper to finance our country's 13-digit budget deficits - yes, a trillion has a 1 and 12 zeros - than would otherwise be the case.  So what's my problem? It's that millions of individual investors are being forced into the stock market to get any meaningful income from their savings, because they can no longer count on traditional havens such as savings accounts, certificates of deposit, Treasury securities or money market mutual funds.  Bizarrely, the dividend yield on an S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index fund, about 1.8 percent, is almost triple the yield on a 10-year Treasury note (0.64 percent when last I looked) and considerably higher than the...</description>

      <title>Republican lawmakers confirm intelligence reports...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-says-U-S-intelligence-did-not-find-reports-15373347.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON -- Leading Republican lawmakers on Monday confirmed that U.S. intelligence agencies have developed information about a Russian military operation targeting U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan. But they said that any U.S. response should wait until intelligence agencies fully review the material, some of which was shared with members of Congress in a classified briefing at the White House.  Current and former intelligence officials familiar with the intelligence said it was less ambiguous than White House officials and some lawmakers have portrayed and indicated that Russian military intelligence had offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants who killed U.S. military personnel.  The CIA in particular has been analyzing the intelligence for several months and has assessed that the Russian program is real, according to these people. The CIA declined to comment.  The intelligence was considered significant and credible enough that it was included in the President's Daily Brief, according to two individuals familiar with the matter, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. The brief is a collection of the most significant analysis on issues affecting national security and foreign policy and is prepared for the president and his top advisers.  Some officials think the Russian operation led to the deaths of several U.S. service members, according to intelligence gleaned from captured militants in recent months. It was unclear exactly how many Americans or coalition troops from other countries may have been killed or targeted, several people familiar with the matter said.  "There was intelligence reported on the allegation that the Russians were offering a bounty to the Taliban to kill Americans, but at the same time there was a very strong dissenting view from another...</description>

      <title>Johns Hopkins's tracker has become gold standard, but creators say many miss real story...</title>
      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/Johns-Hopkins-s-coronavirus-tracker-has-become-a-15374750.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;She found herself listening for the sirens all the time. Before, they had been just background noise, ambulances regularly blasting through Beth Blauer's neighborhood in Baltimore to or from a nearby critical-care facility for the elderly.  Now she knew every emergency trip from the nursing home could turn up later as a statistic on her computer screen.  The novel coronavirus was working its way through the United States, and Blauer - along with dozens of colleagues at Johns Hopkins University - was actively tracking its path.  "The sirens now feel different," she said recently. "They come with a different flood of emotions."  The noise outside her window was a tangible reminder of the human lives hidden in the maze of anonymous data that had come to dominate her days.  Since launching in January, the university's Coronavirus Resource Center had exploded in scope and popularity, garnering millions of page views and popping up in news coverage and daily conversation. Through numbers, the tracker has told the story of what the virus is doing while the story is still unfolding, offering a nearly real-time picture of its silent march across the globe.  But even as data has jumped to the forefront of international discussions about the virus, the Johns Hopkins team wrestles with doubts about whether the numbers can truly capture the scope of the pandemic, or whether the public and policymakers are failing to absorb the big picture. They know what they are producing is not a high-resolution snapshot of the pandemic, but a constantly shifting Etch a Sketch of the trail of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.  Case counts are consistently inconsistent. Reporting practices differ from country to country, state to state, even county to county. If authorities fail to...</description>
