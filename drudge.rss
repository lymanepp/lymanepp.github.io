      <title>Senator to supporters: How about skipping a meal to donate?</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/McSally-to-supporters-How-about-skipping-a-meal-15507664.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHOENIX (AP) - Sen. Martha McSally has suggested that supporters could "fast a meal" to donate to the Arizona Republican's campaign as she fights to fend off a tough challenge from Democrat Mark Kelly.  McSally made the request at a recent event in northern Arizona where she said her campaign needs financial help to counter advertising by Kelly and groups supporting the former astronaut's campaign, azfamily.com reported.  "We're doing our part to catch up, you know, to get our message out," McSally said. "But it takes resources. So, anybody can give, I'm not ashamed to ask, to invest. If you can give a dollar, five dollars, if you can fast a meal and give what that would be."  The remark drew critical attention on social media, while McSally's campaign said the candidate was just joking about skipping a meal.  "This is a dumb, non-story about a candidate," Caroline Anderegg, a McSally campaign spokeswoman, told the Arizona Republic. "It is frankly sad and disgusting that the Dems and the Kelly campaign are launching a misleading character assassination on Martha McSally, who would literally give the shirt off her back for anyone."  Republican businesswoman Christine Jones, who ran for Arizona governor in 2014 and Congress in 2016, called McSally's fundraising pitch "unconventional."  "I haven't talked to (McSally) about it, so I can't really opine on the specifics. But it does feel like its a little bit of an act of desperation," Jones said.  McSally trails Kelly in recent polls by anywhere from 5 to 11 percentage points, according to realclearpolitics.com.</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Changing-weather-prompts-more-fire-fears-in-15508114.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - An unwelcome change in the weather, with higher winds, temperatures and lightning that threatens to spark new wildfires was coming Sunday to parched Northern California, where firefighters have for nearly a week battled three huge "complexes" of fires that have destroyed hundreds of homes and forced tens of thousands to flee.  Firefighters made slow but hopeful progress in battling the blazes on Saturday, aided by good weather but hampered by smoky skies that grounded water-dropping aircraft for some of the day. Reinforcements arrived to bolster overwhelmed crews, and evacuation orders were lifted in some areas.  But the changing weather brought fears of new fires overnight and warnings from state and local officials for residents in threatened areas to prepare to flee at any moment.  "There's not a feeling of pure optimism, but a feeling of resolve, a feeling of we have resources backing us up," Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore said.  Since Aug. 15, state fire officials said more than 12,000 lightning strikes across the state have ignited more than 500 wildfires. Of those, about two dozen major fires were attracting most of the state's resources. Most of the damage was caused by three clusters of fire "complexes" that were ravaging forest and rural areas in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. They have burned 1,120 square miles (2,900 square kilometers).  Among the casualties were ancient redwood trees at California's oldest state park, Big Basin Redwoods, plus the park's headquarters and campgrounds. Smoke from the fires made the region's air quality dangerous, forcing people to stay inside.  Overall, the fires have killed five people, torched nearly 700 homes and other structures and forced tens of thousands from their houses.  "Tuesday night when I went to bed I had a...</description>

      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Mail-in-ballots-were-part-of-a-plot-to-deny-15507606.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traveling to Baltimore in the fall of 1864, Orville Wood had no way of knowing he would soon uncover the most elaborate election conspiracy in America's brief history.  Wood was a merchant from Clinton County in the most northeastern corner of New York. As a supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, he was tasked with visiting troops from his hometown to "look after the local ticket."  New York legislators had only established the state's mail-in voting system in April with the intent of ensuring the suffrage of White troops battling the Confederate Army.  The results of the 1864 elections would heavily affect the outcome of the war. Lincoln and his supporters in the National Union Party sought to continue the war and defeat the Confederacy outright. Meanwhile antiwar Democrats, also referred to as Copperheads, looked for an immediate compromise with the Confederate leaders and the end of the abolition movement.  Troops from New York were allowed to authorize individuals back home to cast a vote on their behalf. Along with their mail-in ballots, troops would assign their power of attorney on slips that required four signatures: the voter's, the person authorized as a recipient, a witness to the signed affidavit and a fellow officer. These documents would be sealed in an envelope and shipped back home to be counted in the final vote. This was the process that Orville Wood intended to uphold, he would testify in court later. He quickly found out what a challenge that would be.  Wood arrived at Fort McHenry in Baltimore to visit with the 91st New York Regiment. There, an Army captain suggested that there had been some "checker playing" when it came to the gathering of soldiers' mail-in ballots. These suspicions of fraud were echoed when Wood visited wounded men at the Newton University Hospital. The rumors of wrongdoing led...</description>

      <title>Two Dems chase generational change from opposite corners of movement...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/In-Mass-two-Democrats-chase-generational-change-15507162.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Morse and Joe Kennedy both want to turn the page to a new generation of Democrats, suggesting that entrenched incumbents sometimes just tend to coast.  Who should have the real clout on Capitol Hill?  "It's not those members of Congress who have been there 30 or 40 years," Morse, 31, said Friday in a telephone interview.  "I am running against somebody who's been in elective office in Massachusetts for 47 years," Rep. Kennedy, 39, said Thursday, rattling off the extent of his opponent's career in politics. "I think by all accounts, he was pretty much a figure of the political establishment."  Morse, the four-term mayor of Holyoke in western Massachusetts, is trying to unseat Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, a 30-year incumbent who chairs the powerful House Ways and Means Committee in the state's Sept. 1 Democratic primary. And Kennedy, a four-term member of the House from outside Boston, is running against Democratic Sen. Edward Markey, whose first congressional oath of office in 1977 took place before Kennedy was born.  Yet Morse and Kennedy find themselves in opposite corners of today's Democratic moment, a political interchange that is confusing with its mixed paths of generational challenges and ideological purity tests.  Morse has the full backing of the liberal groups that have helped knock off a handful of veteran Democratic incumbents in the past two years, paving the way to Congress for a younger, more diverse array of lawmakers. Most of the same groups have rallied behind Markey, despite his being a 74-year-old White man, after he forged an ideological alliance with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., whose upset primary win in June 2018 served as a bolt of lightning for these far-left liberals.  That's left Kennedy running defensively at times, as if he is...</description>
