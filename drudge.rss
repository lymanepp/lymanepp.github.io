      <title>Couple married for love. Then bride's father hired assassins...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/A-young-Indian-couple-married-for-love-Then-the-14357641.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MIRYALAGUDA, India - They were young, glamorous and dreamily in love.  Pranay Perumalla strode into the wedding hall in a midnight blue suit, his face lit by a grin as he clasped the hand of his bride, Amrutha Varshini. The couple draped huge garlands of flowers around one another's necks and relatives threw grains of yellow rice that caught in their dark hair.  But even as they celebrated, they were already in danger.  One bright afternoon less than a month later, the couple left a doctor's appointment in the small southern Indian city where they grew up. A man came up behind them carrying a large butcher knife in his right hand. He hacked Pranay twice on the head and neck, killing him instantly.  Pranay, 23, was a Dalit, a term used to describe those formerly known as "untouchables." Amrutha, 21, belongs to an upper caste. Her rich and powerful family viewed the couple's union as an unacceptable humiliation. Her father, T. Maruthi Rao, was so enraged that he hired killers to murder his son-in-law, court documents say.  While Indian society is changing, it is not shifting rapidly enough for couples like Amrutha and Pranay, whose marriage defied an age-old system of discrimination and hierarchy. Even as India has lifted millions out of poverty, increased education rates and built one of the world's fastest-growing economies, the influence of caste - a social order rooted in Hindu scriptures and based on an identity determined at birth - remains pervasive.  That system is at its most resilient in marriage. A 2017 study found that just 5.8% of Indian marriages are between people of different castes, a rate that has changed little in four decades. The results surprised the researchers, who had expected to see "more intermingling of the different castes," said Tridip Ray, a statistician and the lead author. "Unfortunately,...</description>

      <title>WHITE HOUSE MULLS PAYROLL TAX CUT</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/White-House-officials-eyeing-payroll-tax-cut-in-14360954.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several senior White House officials have begun discussing whether to push for a temporary payroll tax cut as a way to arrest an economic slowdown, three people familiar with the discussions said, revealing the growing concerns by President Donald Trump's top economic aides.  The talks are still in their early stages, and the officials have not decided whether to formally push Congress to approve the cut, these people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to disclose internal discussions. But the White House in recent days has begun searching for proposals that could halt a slowing economy.  Millions of Americans pay a "payroll tax" on their earnings, a 6.2 percent levy that is used to finance Medicare and Social Security programs. The payroll tax was last cut during the Obama administration, to 4.2 percent, as a way to encourage more consumer spending during the recent economic downturn. But the cut was allowed to reset back up to 6.2 percent in 2013.  Americans pay payroll taxes on income up to $132,900, so cutting the payroll tax has remained a popular idea for many lawmakers seeking to deliver savings for middle-income earners and not the wealthiest Americans. But payroll tax cuts can also add dramatically to the deficit and - depending on how they are designed - pull billions of dollars away from Social Security and Medicare.  The discussions about whether to pursue a new payroll tax cut have only begun in recent days, the three people said, and specific details about the design have not been reached yet.  Trump and top aides have spent the past few days trying to convince the public that the economy is strong and that fears about a recession are misguided. But White House officials quietly have begun scrambling for new ideas to reverse public concerns and boost business...</description>

      <title>Speaks at Native American forum in Iowa...</title>
      <link>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/08/19/warren_begins_speech_to_native_american_forum_with_apology.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren began her speech Monday morning at the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City with an apology for incorrectly identifying herself as a Native American throughout her career. President Trump catapulted the issue into the headlines last year by labeling her "Pocahontas," eventually goading her into taking a DNA test which showed she was less than 1% Native American.  "Before I go any further in this I want to say this -- like anyone who's been honest with themselves I know I've made mistakes. I'm sorry for any harm I've caused," Warren told the audience. "I have learned a lot and I am grateful for the many conversations that we've had together. It is a great honor to be able to partner with Indian country and that's what I've tried to do as a senator, and that is what I promise to do as President of the United States of America." "The federal government's history with our tribal nations has been one of broken promises. We need to make change," Warren continued. Warren's campaign released a policy platform aimed at Native American issues on Friday, ahead of this forum: Warren Unveils Native American Policy Plan -- The Hill President Trump most recently mocked her with the name of the 17th-century Native American woman at a New Hampshire rally on Thursday where he said: "I did the Pocahontas thing. I hit her really hard. And it looked like she was down and out. But it was too long ago, I should have waited. But don't worry, we'll revive it. It can be revived. It will be revived. And it can be revived very easily and very quickly, and we're gonna have some fun in the state of New Hampshire."</description>
