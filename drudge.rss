      <title>Hezbollah downs Israeli drone...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Hezbollah-downs-Israeli-drone-in-ongoing-tension-14424127.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;JERUSALEM - Hezbollah announced Monday it had downed an Israeli drone in southern Lebanon, part of a string of clashes between Israel and Iranian-banked groups throughout the region.  The Israeli army also said early Monday that Iran's elite Quds Force oversaw the firing of several rockets from Syria toward Israel, none of which managed to reach their target.  The rocket attacks follow reports from Syrian opposition activists that several Iranians and allied militias were killed by airstrikes in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border. It was not immediately clear who had carried out these strikes, although Israel has launched a significant number of attacks on Iranian targets in Syria throughout the country's civil war.  In recent weeks, Israel has struck targets in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon to stop Iran from distributing sophisticated weapons within striking distance of its borders.  Although limited, Hezbollah's downing of a drone - seen as a possible retaliation for an earlier strike that the militant group blamed on Israel and which Jerusalem has yet to deny - and the rockets fired from Syria could be the latest salvos in the simmering tensions between Israel and Iran, Hezbollah's chief sponsor.  In a statement, Hezbollah said that its operatives shot down the Israeli drone outside the village of Ramyeh, across the border from northern Israel and that "it is now in their hands."  The Israeli Army confirmed in a statement that the drone had been shot down "on a routine mission in northern Israel" as it "fell into Lebanese territory." Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli Army, declined to comment on the specific nature of the drone's activities in Lebanon or if Israel had been involved in the strikes on Syrian territory.  "There is no risk of breach of...</description>
