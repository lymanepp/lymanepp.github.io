      <title>App on Xi ideology allows data access to 100 million user phones...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Chinese-app-on-Xi-s-ideology-allows-data-access-14516955.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIJING - The Chinese Communist Party appears to have "superuser" access to all the data on more than 100 million cellphones, owing to a back door in a propaganda app that the government has been promoting aggressively this year.  An examination of the code in the app shows it enables authorities to retrieve every message and photo from a user's phone, browse their contacts and internet history, and activate an audio recorder inside the device, according to a U.S.-funded analysis.  "The [Chinese Communist Party] essentially has access to over 100 million users' data," said Sarah Aoun, director of technology at the Open Technology Fund, an initiative funded by the U.S. government under Radio Free Asia. "That's coming from the top of a government that is expanding its surveillance into citizens' day-to-day lives."  The party, led by Xi Jinping, launched the app, called "Study the Great Nation," in January. The name is a pun because the Chinese word for study - "xuexi" - contains the authoritarian leader's family name.  The app contains news articles and videos, many of them about Xi's activities or his ideology, "Xi Jinping Thought." There is even a sense of competition, with users earning points for reading articles and commenting on them, and a leader board showing how users are faring in quizzes.  The app, which can be downloaded on all types of smartphones including Apple and Android, has been called Xi's high-tech equivalent of Mao Zedong's Little Red Book and was launched amid a campaign to bolster the Communist Party's ideological control over the Chinese population.  It quickly became the most downloaded app in China, including in Apple's app store in the country, with state media reporting in April that it had more than 100 million registered users.
