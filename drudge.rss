Australia is dealing with its worst COVID-19 outbreak, fuelled by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus that has put more people in hospitals and intensive care than at any time during the pandemic. A total of 74 deaths were registered by late morning between New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, Australia's three most populous states, exceeding the previous national high of 57 last Thursday, official data showed.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chamath Palihapitiya, the CEO of "Social Capital" and owner of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, told the "All-In" podcast that "nobody cares" about the ethnic cleansing of Uyghur Muslims in East Turkestan by the Chinese Communist Party.  "If you're asking me if I care about a segment of a class of people in another country, not until we can take care of ourselves will I prioritize them over us," he said.  Social Capital's website states: "Our mission is to advance humanity by solving the world's hardest problems. We partner with companies at every stage of their business, for as long as it takes." "It's a nice thing that you care, but nobody else cares." "I'm telling you a hard, ugly truth. Of all the things I care about, it is below my line," Palihapitiya said. "I care about the fact that our economy could turn on a line if China invades Taiwan. I care about that. I care about climate change. I care about America's crippling and decrepit healthcare infrastructure. But if you're asking me if I care about a segment of a class of people in another country, not until we can take care of ourselves will I prioritize them over us." "I'm sorry if that's a hard truth to hear, but every time I say I care about the Uyghurs, I m really just lying."
