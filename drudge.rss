      <title>Dems demand U.S. Postal Service reverse rules slowing delivery...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-targets-Nevada-mail-voting-in-lawsuit-even-15461535.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill told negotiators for President Donald Trump on Wednesday that preserving funding for the U.S. Postal Service and removing new rules that have slowed delivery times are essential ingredients of a new coronavirus relief bill in a year when millions of Americans plan to vote by mail.  "Elections are sacred," Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters after a meeting with Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. "To do cutbacks when ballots, all ballots, have to be counted - we can't say, 'Oh, we'll get 94 percent of them.' It's insufficient."  Schumer said he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told DeJoy, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, that their demands regarding the Postal Service are necessary to striking a deal on a broader relief bill that may also include new unemployment benefits and a payroll tax cut.  "It was a heated discussion," Schumer said, adding that the demand is a "sine qua non for us. We told that to the postmaster."  DeJoy declined to take questions as he left the Capitol. Meadows suggested that Schumer is looking at the Postal Service as a "fall guy" to blame if ballots are delayed.  "I don't know that it's the postmaster general's position to assure him what's going to happen with the elections," he said.  "It's not a post office problem," Meadows added. "It's a secretary of state problem in each state."  That contradicted a statement from Trump earlier Wednesday, when the president said that part of his opposition to mail balloting is that the USPS is ill prepared to handle it.  "I'm sure the post office doesn't have enough time," Trump said in the Oval Office during a meeting with Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican. "Millions of...</description>

      <title>WHITE HOUSE FOR RENT:  PLANNED RNC CONVENTION SPEECH FROM SOUTH LAWN IGNITES CONTROVERSY...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Democrats-and-Republicans-push-back-on-Trump-s-15462379.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Local and national leaders pushed back Wednesday against President Donald Trump's desire to deliver his convention acceptance speech from the White House, warning that the event could bring protests and novel coronavirus spread to the nation's capital while violating historic norms that separate political activity from the seat of presidential power.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., predicted that a political convention gathering at the White House "won't happen," for legal and ethical reasons, while District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, said she did not plan to offer "any exemptions" for the event from a recent health order that restricts the movement of nonessential visitors to the city from 27 states with elevated rates of the virus.  Members of the District Council expressed alarm about the idea, and on Capitol Hill, some Republicans also voiced concern. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas called it "problematic," Sen. John Thune of South Dakota questioned the legality of political events at the White House, and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin suggested that other plans should be made.  "Probably not allowed," he said. "Probably shouldn't do it."  The pushback came as Trump indicated publicly for the first time that he preferred speaking from the White House at the end of four nights of convention programming, from Aug. 24-27, that will be a mix of live speeches from around the country and prerecorded video. In an interview Wednesday on "Fox and Friends," he described the White House as a "beautiful setting" that is "greatly representative of our nation" where the logistics would be easy and inexpensive to arrange.  A Republican involved in the planning said it was highly likely that Trump's speech would be delivered at the White House, perhaps on the South Lawn, but various locations were...</description>

      <title>Keeping loved ones from visiting patients making them sicker...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/article/Keeping-loved-ones-from-visiting-our-coronavirus-15463298.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly six months into the coronavirus pandemic, an emptiness lingers at the bedsides of our patients in hospitals wards and intensive care units. Though some hospitals are trying out limited visitation policies, most are not, leaving too many of our patients without loved ones at their side. The trauma to families, while difficult to measure, is immense, and the absence of loved ones is making things worse for patients and their medical care teams. It's as if we have fallen back in time.  ICUs of the 1990s were not inviting to families. We imposed uncompromising and paternalistic limits on visitation with patients. There was no sharing of power, or even knowledge. A patient's family was often viewed as preoccupied by minor concerns that paled in comparison to the physician's definitive vision of what was important. That period, in retrospect, was defined by a kind of testimonial injustice - a prevailing prejudice that deflated the authority of family and consolidated power solely within the medical team. Are we repeating that same injustice now?  What the virus that causes covid-19 brought - along with fear, contagion and uncertainty - is epistemic exclusion, which is to say that families are excluded from essential moments of their loved one's illness, recovery and dying process that would allow understanding and healing. There is simply no way the family, excluded from the bedside during a novel pandemic, can share the knowledge the team possesses. The best tools and patterns of communication on our digital devices are never going to be enough to allow someone to truly know what's going on in the hospital. And without families, care teams are missing essential knowledge about the patient. We are handicapping each other.  Take, for example, Fred Reyes, an ICU patient who, like so many others we've seen, is Hispanic...</description>

      <title>SHOCK TURNS TO ANGER</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Beirut-blast-death-toll-rises-to-100-with-more-15459969.php#item-85307-tbla-6</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIRUT - As dazed Lebanese picked through the wreckage inflicted by the massive explosion in their capital city on Wednesday, shock turned to anger at the corruption and incompetence that allowed a massive pile of dangerous chemicals to sit unattended in a warehouse at Beirut's port for six years.  An estimated 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer and bombmaking ingredient, has been identified as the immediate cause of the blast that engulfed the city on Tuesday, killing at least 135 people, injuring more than 3,000 and leaving more than 100 unaccounted for. The material had been stored in a warehouse since being seized by customs authorities in 2014, despite repeated warnings from port officials that it was a risk.  Government investigators still have not pinpointed the origin of the fire or explosion that erupted some 15 to 20 minutes before the ammonium nitrate ignited, sending a vast mushroom cloud of toxic gases rippling across the city. The blast was heard 150 miles away on the island of Cyprus.  Beirut has witnessed many explosions, including the bombing of the U.S. Marine Barracks in 1983 that killed 241 Marines, the assassination of the former prime minister Rafic Hariri in 2005 and the countless small blasts of the mortars and shells that rained down on the city during the civil war from 1975 to 1990.  This was by far the biggest - and the shock waves reverberated beyond the immediate tragedy of lost lives and homes. It seemed to encapsulate everything that is wrong with Lebanon at this juncture in its turbulent history: A weak state, inept government, corrupt officials and, many said, the existence of a parallel state run by the powerful Hezbollah movement, as well as other Lebanese factions that used the port for their own smuggling operations.  "People saw firsthand with devastating results what it...</description>

The goal of Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. vaccine initiative, is 300 million doses of a safe, effective vaccine by January, and if realized, it would be one of the greatest scientific achievements of all time. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs predicted the Food and Drug Administration would approve at least one vaccine before the end of the year.</description>
