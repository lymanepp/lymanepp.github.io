      <title>From Hollywood to Silicon Valley, the Justice Department is backing corporate giants... </title>
      <link>https://www.ncadvertiser.com/opinion/article/From-Hollywood-to-Silicon-Valley-the-Justice-14918993.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ncadvertiser.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a battle going on for the future of American business. On one side are a handful of giant corporations that dominate their industries. On the other are the smaller companies they compete against, buy from, or sell to, and the workers they hire. And what you need to know is that under President Donald Trump, the Justice Department is routinely weighing in on the side of the corporate giants.  We've already seen the big-is-better philosophy in the department's approval of megamergers such as Aetna and CVS in health care, T-Mobile and Sprint in mobile phone service and movie giants Disney and Fox, which in some years account for half of all box office sales. The one time the department went to court to stop a megamerger (AT&amp;T and Time-Warner), it managed to lose.  Now, antitrust chief Makan Delrahim is moving aggressively to help the giants enhance their market power in new ways.  Last month, the Justice Department asked a federal court in New York to terminate a set of 70-year-old decrees that prevented the major Hollywood studios from owning and operating movie theaters. The decrees also prevented the studios from setting minimum ticket prices or requiring independent theaters to take blocks of movies - the likely flops along with the hits - rather than choose which movies they wanted to exhibit.  The department argued that the arrival of new studios such as HBO, Netflix and Amazon Prime, along with the advent of other distribution channels such as CDs, cable TV and streaming over the Internet. The brief also embraced now-discredited economic theories that mergers between producers and distributors, and business practices such as bundling and retail price maintenance, were good for competition and consumers.  Thanks to those decrees, Hollywood is enjoying a golden era, with more studios producing more movies...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BERLIN (AP) — Scientists in Switzerland have found a way to make brown chocolate colorful, without adding further ingredients. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology said Thursday that researchers discovered a method to imprint a special structure on the surface of chocolate that makes it shimmer and shine like a rainbow. The university said the process mimics the effect of chameleon skin, which can change to display specific colors. It said the rainbow chocolate is ready for industrial production and the scientists are already in talks with big chocolate makers. ___ Video: https://youtu.be/l3ZFZ_ApzGY</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who would have taken President Trump for a box office prognosticator? He briefly became one with a gaffe at his Wednesday night rally occurring at the same time that the House of Representatives passed articles of impeachment charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The president meant to declare that Democrats will experience a backlash in the 2020 election as a result, but instead, he briefly got the worlds of entertainment and politics all mixed up. 'They'll receive a big backlash at the box office,' Trump said of House Democrats, clearly trying to casually correct himself moments later by referencing 'that ballot box on November 3rd' as if that's what he said the first time. Then again, if Trump did mean box office, it wouldn't be out of line after his declaration in August that 'Hollywood is racist' and that 'what they're doing with the kind of movies they're putting out, it's actually very dangerous to our country.' Or perhaps he was actually taking about the Democrats' decision to hold a presidential debate on the opening night of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, predicting a huge surge in ticket sales from those who are specifically choosing not to tune in. As Trump might say, who can figure out the true meaning of the box office comment? Enjoy! Brendan Morrow Pres. Trump: House Democrats 'look like a bunch of foolsâ€¦Theyâ€™ll receive a big backlash at the box office.â€� https://t.co/O9l3h6v4WW pic.twitter.com/3mxqYeprIi â€” ABC News (@ABC) December 19, 2019</description>

      <title>Authorities find 'monkey dungeon' in zoo...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Va-authorities-find-a-monkey-dungeon-in-a-zoo-14918185.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a U.S. Department of Agriculture animal welfare inspector visited Wilson's Wild Animal Park this summer, she identified no violations. The federal inspection report for the Virginia zoo, home to about 200 exotic and barnyard animals, was pristine.  But that is not what local law enforcement officers found the very next day. Sent by the state attorney general, their observations triggered a search one week later by a team of veterinarians, zoologists and law enforcement officers. They discovered an array of problems, according to later court testimony, including a pony with a swollen face, maggot-covered meat in the tiger cage, and what a prosecutor described as a "monkey dungeon."  The search team seized 119 animals whose lives they deemed to be in danger. Last month, zoo owner Keith Wilson and an employee were each charged under Virginia law with 46 counts of animal cruelty.  The chasm between the USDA and local assessments is a stark illustration of a dramatic decline in federal animal welfare enforcement amid a Trump administration deregulation push. From 2016 to 2018, the number of citations issued by the USDA to about 10,000 zoos, circuses, breeders and research labs it regulates dropped by 65 percent. The agency attributes the drop in citations, which can lead to fines and revoked licenses, to new efforts to work closely with businesses and their veterinarians to correct violations. Former employees have said it's the result of a more lenient approach that puts animals at risk.  Wilson's was among the facilities the USDA stopped citing. For years, inspectors documented numerous violations there, including a lion enclosure with walls too short to prevent the cats' escape and a concrete-floored bear pen with little more than a tire swing for entertainment. Since mid-2018, the zoo's three reports have been...</description>

      <title>Three-month battle tested political will of both parties...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Three-month-battle-tested-the-political-will-of-14917367.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sat quietly at the head of the long table inside her ornate conference room early this month, listening as her deputies debated the last major decision in the impeachment of President Donald Trump.  Her senior lieutenants argued for an expansive bill of charges encompassing the Mueller report. Others pressed for articles of impeachment focused solely on Trump's pressure on Ukraine to help his reelection bid.  Ultimately, it didn't matter. Pelosi had all but made up her mind.  Two days earlier, while she was in a Madrid hotel for a climate conference, Pelosi took a call from anxious moderate members of her Democratic caucus who were feeling heat in their home districts about supporting impeachment. The speaker, they said, should resist liberal calls to expand the investigation.  Pelosi did not tip her hand on the call. But it was a compelling argument from her "majority makers," the group whose members flipped pro-Trump districts in 2018, helping make Pelosi speaker for the second time, and have guided her thinking from the earliest moments of the three-month impeachment saga.  "It was not much of a debate," Pelosi, D-Calif., recalled in an interview Tuesday. "When we made our decision to go forward, there was no opposition to it."  The back and forth was a closing snapshot of how Democrats proceeded toward Wednesday's momentous vote to impeach Trump on two counts, abusing his power and obstructing Congress. While the Democrats voted almost entirely in lockstep, and the outcome was never truly in doubt, the result belied an emotional and often caustic behind-the-scenes drama that exposed - and at times exacerbated - divisions within the House Democratic caucus.  The experience tested the will of centrist Democrats from pro-Trump...</description>
