      <title>Did Bloomberg waste $500 million?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Did-Mike-Bloomberg-waste-500-million-running-for-15101124.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the craps table of this campaign, there's a $500 million chip sitting on "Super Tuesday." The bettor's name is mike - small "m," according to the visual design of his campaign, like he's your modest neighbor from the split-level down the block instead of a titan of media and finance with estates in Bermuda and Southampton.  That's Bloomberg. Mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013. Democrat, then Republican, then independent, then Democrat. Purveyor of fancy data terminals. Ninth-richest person in the world. A few months ago Bloomberg saw a moribund field of candidates and thought he could vault his way to the nomination through a delegate grab on Super Tuesday.  So now it's mike, responsible presidential candidate, asking for the car keys as the nation stumbles around.  Is he trying to save the party, or accidentally sabotaging it? Is "mike" just a proxy for Bloomberg as he tries to buy the presidency?  "My first answer to that all the time is: What's the right price to save democracy from Donald Trump?" said Tim O'Brien, a senior adviser to mike, at a Bloomberg house party in McLean, Virginia, Thursday night. There, Northern Virginians sipped Chianti and canned Perrier and whispered about Joe Biden as if he were an uncle in hospice care (this was 48 hours before his defibrillation in South Carolina). They shuddered at the thought of Bernie Sanders, democratic socialist, for his perceived radicalism and dismissed Elizabeth Warren, capitalist reformer, for her vendetta against mike.  What's a democracy worth? A year ago, before mike arrived on the scene, Bloomberg pledged a half billion to vanquishing Trump. In Virginia, over the past three years, he spent $3.5 million to help flip the statehouse to Democrats, whose gun-control advocates now speak of him with reverence. So far this year, Bloomberg has spent $50 million to...</description>

      <title>Smiley responds to six PBS employees' accounts...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Smiley-responds-to-six-PBS-employees-accounts-15099830.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - One by one, the voices of six female employees of former PBS talk show host Tavis Smiley sounded in a District of Columbia courtroom, each woman describing incidents in which they claim Smiley requested sex or told a lewd joke while at work.  Some of the women said that they felt pressured to comply with those requests and that they faced retaliation - even losing their jobs - if they didn't. Others described comments or jokes by Smiley that they said made them uncomfortable in the workplace.  During three weeks of trial, Smiley listened to the women's accounts, played in court by video deposition. When he took the witness stand he admitted that he'd had intimate relationships with two of the women. But he said several of the accounts were false and insisted he never acted with retribution and never intended to offend.  "I'm a black man struggling to make it in America. I have laughed at all of this so-called power. I struggled to raise money to keep my show on the air. I never had such power," Smiley, 55, testified. "I have influence, but I don't have power."  The accusations - and Smiley's responses - were detailed as Smiley and PBS squared off in court, with each side arguing that the other was in breach of contract when the network stopped airing his show in 2017 amid the sexual harassment allegations. On Monday, attorneys for PBS and Smiley gave their closing arguments before the jury began deliberations.  For 14 years, PBS distributed Smiley's late-night talk show to 238 stations nationwide, about 72% of its network.  PBS is suing Smiley for about $1.7 million the network says Smiley owes in money it had provided for a season that never aired. Smiley, who says the network terminated his contract without proof of the allegations, is countersuing...</description>

      <title>Officials clash over passenger tracking...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Major-airlines-U-S-officials-clash-over-15099881.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - U.S. officials are pressuring airline executives to turn over the email addresses and phone numbers of international passengers as the Trump administration tries to track who may have been exposed to the coronavirus, according to five people briefed on the situation.  Government officials have said they need the data so they can warn local authorities about who might have been exposed to the virus. But the airline industry has balked, saying the federal government should instead share information it already collects between different agencies and come up with a system for obtaining the rest.  The impasse has dragged on for weeks despite concerns about the growing number of people with coronavirus in the United States. It has become a top issue of the Trump administration's virus task force and U.S. lawmakers. Airline executives are slated to meet Wednesday with Vice President Mike Pence.  The airline industry has pushed Congress to intervene, with some lobbyists asking lawmakers to insert a provision in an emergency spending package that would effectively absolve the airlines of having to track some of the data.  The failure to resolve the issue could complicate the government's efforts to contain the outbreak's spread. United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines deferred questions to Airlines for America, a lobbying group that represents the airline industry. Airlines for America said collecting the data shouldn't be the airlines' job since the government already has much of it in existing databases. They also said it would take up to a year for the airlines to set up the tracking system.  Even though both sides have been fighting over the data for weeks, the battle has taken on new urgency in recent days.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is asking airlines to collect and - when...</description>

      <title>AMY, PETE ENDORSE JOE...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Democrats-embrace-Biden-as-Sanders-hopes-for-big-15100191.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A parade of establishment Democrats began coalescing around Joe Biden on Monday, an attempt to bolster the former vice president and stall Sen. Bernie Sanders' ascent as voters in 14 states prepared to cast ballots Tuesday, the most consequential day of the presidential nominating contest.  On a day with cascading developments that rapidly recast the presidential race, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., dropped out and made plans to join Biden at his rally in Dallas on Monday night. In a visual symbol of Biden's attempts to consolidate the moderates in the party, former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg - who dropped out Sunday night, and who had an intensely cold relationship with Klobuchar - also scrambled to get to Dallas and endorse Biden.  It was the second straight day that moderates, previously paralyzed over whom to endorse, rushed to join Biden's campaign. Harry Reid, a former Senate majority leader from Nevada, endorsed Biden along with other Democrats including Susan Rice, the former national security adviser to President Barack Obama; political activist and actress Alyssa Milano; Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; and Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.  There are still looming questions about Biden - his propensity for gaffes, the moments when he searches for words or, on Monday, his struggle to come up with well-worn phrases in the Declaration of Independence before shouting, "You know . . . the thing!" - but his campaign has found unmistakable new momentum it is hoping to carry into the elections Tuesday.
