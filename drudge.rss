      <title>Rise of encampments changing face of homelessness...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Homeless-living-in-a-tent-blocks-from-the-US-13709194.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before 10 a.m. on another cold Thursday, Monica Diaz stirred in her tent, filled with dread. It had been two weeks since the last cleanup, and city workers would again be here soon, with their dumpster truck and police cars, to clear out the encampment. Every morning was awful, but these were the worst of all, when Monica, who'd otherwise be resting before work, was forced to confront publicly what she did her best to hide: that she's homeless. That she lives in a tent. That she just turned 40, and that this is somehow her life.  "You ready?" Monica asked her husband, after a sleepless night at the base of Union Station, near CNN's Washington bureau, where the noise never stopped and they'd huddled together with their dog, Sassy, against the cold.  "Somewhat," said Pete Etheridge, 31, sighing.  They looked around their tent, which not only held the sum total of their world but also reflected a way of life that has, over the past decade, fundamentally changed the face of American homelessness. As housing costs climb ever higher in booming urban areas, the significant growth in tent encampments nationwide has become one of the most visible signs of the nation's failure to alleviate widening inequality. In Orange County, California, more than 700 people were cleared out of a tent city along the Santa Ana River last year after thousands signed a petition and Anaheim declared a state of emergency. Seattle, meanwhile, has allowed some tent cities to operate as de facto communities - long-term, regulated, even with phone numbers and addresses. And in Washington, the number of encampment cleanups has surged, according to city data, rising from 29 in 2015 to 100 in 2018.  Monica, a stout, wavy-haired woman now living in her seventh tent after cleanup crews tossed the others, looked down the busy street and tried to gird herself...</description>

      <title>Maddow, Queen of collusion, won't let go...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/entertainment/article/Rachel-Maddow-the-left-s-powerhouse-on-cable-13717367.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel Maddow, the queen of collusion, is not backing down.  A day after Attorney General William Barr said special prosecutor Robert Mueller hadn't found collusion between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russian agents, Maddow - primetime TV's primary and most tenacious proponent of the conspiracy angle - still wasn't buying it.  Instead, Maddow moved on to two related questions: Did Trump obstruct justice? And did Barr let him get away with it?  "Whatever information (Barr) just received from Robert Mueller about the president's behavior as it pertains to potential criminal obstruction of justice, Barr could have just passed that information onto (Congress) for them to decide what to do with it," Maddow said on her MSNBC program Monday night. "But instead, somewhat inexplicably, he decided to take it upon himself to declare definitively, 'Yeah, you know, I looked at all that stuff, and I can tell you there is no crime there, it's fine.'"  She added, "Where did this come from? I mean, on what grounds are you saying that you have concluded there is no crime here?"  Maddow's monologue suggests she is unmoved by the many attacks on her for promoting a Russia conspiracy that, at least according to the attorney general, seems to have run aground. Her nightly deconstructions of the case against Trump have made her the signal figure of the anti-Trump left and have abetted her rise to the most popular figure in cable news.  Trump's supporters savaged Maddow in the wake of the release of Barr's four-page memo Sunday night. The memo said Mueller's 22-month investigation had not turned up evidence sufficient to conclude Trump and his associates were involved in a conspiracy with Russia to sway the 2016 election. It also said Mueller had not drawn a conclusion about whether Trump had obstructed efforts to investigate him -...</description>

      <title>Obama cautions freshman Dems about price tag of liberal policies...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Obama-cautions-freshman-House-Democrats-about-the-13716526.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Former president Barack Obama gently warned a group of freshman House Democrats Monday evening about the costs associated with some liberal ideas popular in their ranks, encouraging members to look at price tags, according to people in the room.

Most Democratic candidates seeking the presidential nomination have embraced a single-payer health-care system and the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan to make the U.S. economy energy efficient in a decade.  But some moderate Democrats worry a lurch left will upend their chances at ousting President Donald Trump. Notably, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calf., who helped organize Obama's meeting with the freshmen, has not put those ideas on the...</description>
