      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.cnn.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was enraging to watch Axios reporter Jonathan Swan's interview with President Trump — and not only because the President displayed naiveté when repeatedly confronted with the facts.</description>

      <title>Republicans consider South Lawn of White House for Trump's convention speech...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Republicans-consider-South-Lawn-of-the-White-15459083.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Republican National Convention planners are considering the White House South Lawn as the site of President Donald Trump's nationally televised nomination acceptance speech later this month, according to a Republican familiar with the discussions.  The decision to stage the most high-profile political event of Trump's reelection campaign at the national seat of presidential power would be just the latest break by Trump in presidential norms, which have historically drawn clear lines between official business of the president and campaign events.  People involved in the planning said that no final decision had been made on the location of the Republican convention's celebratory events. Trump abandoned plans to hold the full convention in Charlotte, and later Jacksonville, Fla., over concerns that large crowds could spread the novel coronavirus.  The South Lawn, which can be subject to intense heat and afternoon thunderstorms in late August, is one of several sites under consideration for the week of festivities, including the Trump International Hotel in the District of Columbia, which the president leases from the federal government, officials said. Any costs incurred by the government to host the events would be repaid, said the Republican, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.  Several hundred Republican delegates plan to gather for a pared-down session of official meetings on Aug. 24 in Charlotte, N.C., to nominate Trump. That will be followed by three more days of speeches and programming from undetermined sites, culminating in Trump's acceptance speech on Aug. 27.  In a press briefing last month, Trump dodged a question about holding the acceptance speech in the White House.  "We haven't set that yet," Trump said. "We'll probably announce that over the...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.forbes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The widespread view that fossil fuels are “dirty” and renewables such as wind and solar energy and electric vehicles are “clean” has become a fixture of mainstream media and policy makers of all persuasions. But, in the case of EVs, the dirty secrets of “clean energy” should seem apparent to all.</description>

      <title>Birx is new target for Trump... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Top-virus-official-Birx-is-new-target-for-Trump-15456043.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump further disparaged his senior health advisers on Monday even as the pandemic deepened its hold on the nation, as the White House's top coronavirus coordinator, Deborah Birx, joined Anthony Fauci and other scientists on the receiving end of the president's ire.  Birx - who built a career leading public health efforts against HIV/AIDS - quickly garnered Trump's favor earlier this year for publicly championing the administration's coronavirus response, becoming a prominent figure inside and outside the White House.  But she soon lost support within swaths of the scientific and medical community for seeming to minimize the virus and to enable Trump's rosy view of the pandemic. This past weekend, Birx lost the backing of the nation's top Democrat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who privately called Birx "the worst" and publicly said she had no confidence in her.  On Monday morning, Birx appeared to lose ground with perhaps her most important constituency, Trump himself, who dismissed her as "pathetic."  "So Crazy Nancy Pelosi said horrible things about Dr. Deborah Birx, going after her because she was too positive on the very good job we are doing on combatting the China Virus, including Vaccines &amp; Therapeutics," Trump wrote in a tweet. "In order to counter Nancy, Deborah took the bait &amp; hit us. Pathetic!"  Trump was especially incensed that she did not strike a more optimistic tone about states that are doing well and by her praise for Pelosi, an ardent Trump critic, said one senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details of private discussions. When asked about Pelosi's lack of confidence in the handling of the pandemic, Birx replied, "I have tremendous respect for the speaker. And I have tremendous respect for her...</description>
