      <title>Conservatives call for 'expeditious' probe...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Conservatives-call-for-expeditious-impeachment-14506081.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - More than a dozen prominent conservative lawyers, including George Conway, offered their legal reasoning for an "expeditious" impeachment probe into President Donald Trump, creating a document they hope will be read by Republicans who continue to stand by the president.  The 16 attorneys, many of whom worked in Republican administrations, wrote in a joint statement to be released Thursday morning that Trump's now infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the text messages between diplomats and Trump's public call for China to investigate a political opponent are "undisputed" events that amount to Trump violating his oath of office.  "We have not just a political candidate open to receiving foreign assistance to better his chances at winning an election, but a current president openly and privately calling on foreign governments to actively interfere in the most sacred of U.S. democratic processes, our elections," they wrote.  Conway, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and outspoken Trump critic, helped form a coalition of like-minded conservatives a year ago who wanted to call out what they deemed illegal and unconstitutional behavior by the president. The signatories are members of that group, Checks and Balances.  Paul Rosenzweig, who served as President George W. Bush's deputy assistant secretary for policy at the Department on Homeland Security, said he personally would have gone further than the group's comments, which are stern, but measured in tone.  "It strikes me that no reasonable attorney can doubt that there was a quid pro quo here," said Rosenzweig, referring to Trump's holding back military aid to Ukraine while requesting the country investigate a political foe.  "I would vote for impeachment, and I would vote for conviction and removal in the Senate as well,"...</description>

      <title>PG&amp;E pleads for employee safety; Vehicle hit by gunfire...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/PG-E-pleads-for-employee-safety-amid-outage-14505820.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Officials at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. on Wednesday called for the public to let employees do their jobs safely amid frustrations with a widespread California power shutdown, after authorities reported that a bullet was fired at one of the energy provider's vehicles.  The plea came the same day that police say a threatening letter was reported at a PG&amp;E facility, as the utility switched off electricity to hundreds of thousands of people. The planned outage - the biggest in the state's history, announced as a measure to reduce wildfire risk - comes as PG&amp;E faces massive liabilities for starting a blaze that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise last year.  "We realize and understand the impact and the hardship as the result of this decision that we've made," Sumeet Singh, vice president of PG&amp;E's Community Wildfire Safety Program, said at a news conference. But employees and contractors "have families that live in your communities, they have friends that are members of your communities," Singh added. "So let's just ensure their safety as well as they are doing this work in the interest of your safety."  Power companies worried about California's devastating wildfires are increasingly turning to planned shutdowns. PG&amp;E says this latest, unusually disruptive measure, which could last several days, was prompted by the dry winds like those that helped fuel disastrous fires before. The outages have upset customers, closed schools and workplaces and raised fears that people who rely on electricity for medical needs could be caught unprepared.  Some have questioned this week's shutdown, which PG&amp;E expects to affect 800,000 people, as excessive. About 650,000 customers were expected to lack power Wednesday evening, according to the company.  "This cannot be something that can be acceptable nor...</description>
