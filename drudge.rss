      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A bright fireball streaked across the skies in the Washington region late Tuesday night.  People throughout the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia indicated that it seemed close to them.  "Did anyone else just see the fireball in the sky in Ellicott City/Marriottsville?!!" someone asked on Twitter around 11 p.m.  Many people apparently did, throughout the region.  A man in the District reported "a huge bright Fireball with bright blue fire falling very close to Capitol Hill at around 11:30pm. "  In a message to a reporter, Kumar Shrestha said he was certain that a search of the area might find its remnants.  "It was very very close," he said.  A woman in the Arlington area exclaimed as follows in a Tweet"Guys!! That was a #FIREBALL that just came shooting through the sky- going due South along the #Potomac."  An Alexandria resident said she saw a large fireball "fall from the" sky.  The American Meteor Society, a clearinghouse for fireball reports, listed a dozen from Maryland and Virginia. Reports were also received at about the same time from other parts of the country.  Estimates of sighting times ranged from about 10:45 p.m. to 11:30 p. m. EDT.  Several fireball photos were posted on twitter feeds late Tuesday and early Wednesday.  Some of the reports to the meteor society indicated that the fireball made a relatively small visual impact. The accounts classed the experience as only one on a scale of five.  However, a witness in Fairfax County rated it as a three.</description>

      <link>https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Craftsmen-built-Notre-Dame-eight-centuries-ago-13773005.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.seattlepi.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the first images of charred wreckage inside the Notre Dame cathedral appeared online Tuesday, engineers around the world said one observation was already clear: To return the ancient structure to its glorious past, builders will likely have turn to cutting-edge technology that many associate with the future.  Even before engineers had been able to access the deepest corners of the still-smoldering structure, design experts, preservationists and engineers were contemplating which modern technologies might be brought to bear to restore one of Europe's most iconic structures to its fabled past.  It's a speculative exercise, they admit, but one that is to be expected with the future of a UNESCO World Heritage Site at stake.  The rebuilding effort will likely draw upon expertise gleaned from disasters like the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan and the Brazilian National Museum fire, where experimental robots and new digital tools have been used to go places people cannot safely venture and replicate detailed artifacts lost to fire.  Throughout the rebuilding effort, experts say, engineers and preservationists will be forced to wrestle with an ever-present question.  "How do they meld brand new 21st century technologies with ancient craftsmanship and building trades in ways that keep the cathedral preserved and alive?" said Katherine Malon-France, the interim chief preservation officer of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded nonprofit based in Washington. "This is going to be a very interesting intersection of technology and craft, and the world will be closely watching how they pull it off."  Some of the technology that will be used to restore Notre Dame has already been on display. As a wall of orange flames roared across the cathedral's roof Monday, and hundreds of firefighters...</description>
