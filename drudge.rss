      <title>Now ineligible to play?</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/NFL-will-consider-placing-Antonio-Brown-on-paid-14431061.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NFL will give serious consideration to placing Antonio Brown on paid leave via its commissioner's exempt list, according to multiple people familiar with the situation, after he was accused in a federal lawsuit in Florida of rape and sexual assault.  The wide receiver would be ineligible to play for the New England Patriots if he's placed on the exempt list by the league.  Placing Brown on the exempt list is "possible" and something that the NFL is "going to have to focus on," said one of the people close to the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.  The league is investigating the allegations but it's unclear whether a decision about the exempt list will be made this week, before the Patriots are scheduled to play again. Brown has not been charged with a crime, so the NFL does not have to be concerned, at this point, about interfering with a criminal investigation. It is not clear yet if or when the league's investigators will be able to arrange interviews with Brown's accuser and other potential witnesses.  If the league opts to put Brown on paid leave, it also would have to decide under what conditions he would be permitted to come off the exempt list and how it would react, for example, to a prospective settlement of the civil lawsuit. Brown has denied the allegations through his attorney.  NFL leaders planned to meet Wednesday about the matter. The league potentially could allow Brown to begin playing for the Patriots while its investigation proceeds, and then place him on paid leave at some point if NFL officials believe that is warranted.  Brown was at the Patriots' facility Wednesday with the expectation that he would participate in meetings and practice, ESPN reported.  He agreed to a one-year contract with...</description>

      <title>POLL SHOCK:  6 Dem candidates beating Trump in Texas? </title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/864097/6-democratic-candidates-are-beating-trump-new-texas-poll</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump might not want to look at a new poll conducted by Univision and the University of Houston. The survey shows six Democratic presidential candidates leading the incumbent in Texas. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has the healthiest lead over Trump â€” a 48 percent to 42 percent edge. Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden has Trump beat 47 percent to 43 percent, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is ahead 44 percent to 42 percent. Those three, frequently considered the front-runners in the Democratic primaries, don't come as a huge surprise, but Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also hold slight advantages. Former Housing Secretary and homegrown Texan JuliÃ¡n Castro is the sixth candidate that Texas would seemingly support over Trump; he has a three point lead over the commander-in-chief. Those are the only six candidates highlighted in the survey for this particular question. Oddly, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) is not pitted against Trump, though among the Democratic candidates, he finished second only to Biden in the survey, and led all other candidates by seven points or more among Texas Latinx voters. So it appears the El Paso native is doing pretty well in his home state at the moment.

The poll was conducted between Aug. 31 and Sept. 6 on the phone and online. It consisted of 1,004 voters and the margin of error was 3.1 percent. See the full results here.

      <title>USA drops 40 tons of bombs on ISIS-'infested' island in Iraq...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/US-drops-40-tons-of-bombs-on-IS-infested-island-14428134.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BAGHDAD (AP) - The U.S.-led coalition says American warplanes have dropped 36,000 kilograms (40 tons) of bombs on an Island in the Tigris River "infested" with members of the Islamic State group.  The coalition said F15 and F35 warplanes took part in the bombing on Qanus Island in the central province of Salaheddine, north of the capital Baghdad.  Tuesday's attack is part of operations carried out by Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition against IS, which was defeated in Iraq in 2017.  IS sleeper cells have since carried out deadly bombings in Iraq.  IS controlled large swathes of Syria and Iraq where they declared a caliphate in 2014.  A video released by the military showed massive explosions creating mushroom clouds billowing from the island that appeared to have been subjected to carpet bombing.</description>
