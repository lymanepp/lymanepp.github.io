      <title>TRUMP WANTS WEEKLY FOX SHOW</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/937587/trump-says-hell-fox--friends-every-week--but-host-steve-doocy-doesnt-agree-have</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump is apparently under the impression he has a standing weekly date with the hosts of Fox &amp; Friends — but they might not be on board. Trump on Tuesday appeared on Fox &amp; Friends for another lengthy phone interview, and at the top of the conversation, he informed viewers that this would be a weekly occurrence going forward. 'We've agreed to do it once a week in the morning, and I look forward to it,' Trump said. But it's unclear who the 'we' in that sentence was considering host Steve Doocy expressed surprise at this news, responding, 'I haven't heard that.' Later, after a conversation that lasted nearly 50 minutes, Trump reiterated that viewers should tune in next Monday for more. But this time, Doocy made clear that this arrangement has not been agreed upon by Fox News at all. 'You may want to do it every week, but Fox is not committed to that,' Doocy told Trump. 'We're going to take it on a case by case basis.' Doocy's co-host Brian Kilmeade looked completely bewildered as he made this declaration on the air, possibly as he processed the fact that the network might soon have to start ghosting the president of the United States. Brendan Morrow Donald Trump: 'We're gonna [call into Fox &amp; Friends] every week. Every Monday I think they said.' Brian Kilmeade: 'Sounds good.'

      <title>Prominent Southern Baptists dropping 'Southern' name amid racial unrest...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Prominent-Southern-Baptists-are-dropping-15567758.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention are increasingly dropping the "Southern" part of their Baptist name, calling it a potentially painful reminder of the convention's historic role in support of slavery.  The 50,000 Baptist churches in the convention are autonomous and can still choose to refer to themselves as "Southern Baptist" or "SBC." But in his first interview on the topic, convention president J.D. Greear said momentum has been building to adopt the name "Great Commission Baptists," both because of the racial reckoning underway in the United States and because many have long seen the "Southern Baptist" name as too regional for a global group of believers.  "Our Lord Jesus was not a White Southerner but a brown-skinned Middle Eastern refugee," said Greear, who this summer used the phrase "Black lives matter" in a presidential address and announced that he would retire a historic gavel named for an enslaver. "Every week we gather to worship a savior who died for the whole world, not one part of it. What we call ourselves should make that clear."  The shift takes place at the end of a summer of racial unrest, when Confederate monuments have been removed, schools have been renamed and Washington D.C. has decided to change the name of its football team. For Southern Baptists, the change also reflects a long-standing desire to remove confusion when the convention launches churches in the Northern United States and overseas.  The convention formed in 1845, splitting from Northern Baptists over Southern support for missionaries who owned enslaved people, and is considered the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, with 14.5 million members. It will continue to legally operate as the SBC, officials said, citing the hefty cost and complexity of a legal name change. But since August, the denomination's...</description>

      <title>More Wohl Drama... </title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/A-fake-FBI-raid-orchestrated-by-right-wing-15567141.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fake FBI raid staged Monday by a notorious right-wing activist and conspiracist turned into an embarrassment for The Washington Post, which briefly reported the faux-event as if it were the real deal.  The "raid" on a house in Arlington, Va., actually involved actors recruited by Jacob Wohl, who has a history of making false accusations and has orchestrated dubious events in an effort to smear perceived opponents of President Donald Trump.  This time, Wohl recruited actors to pose as FBI agents, telling them they would be participating in a scene for a "TV pilot," one of the actors involved told the Daily Beast. The actors donned FBI-style windbreakers and pretended they were raiding a house during early-morning hours.  It appears Wohl used photos of the event to trick a reporter into believing that Wohl's longtime associate, Jack Burkman, was being targeted by law enforcement officials. The intended purpose of the deception was not clear.  In a story written by Metro reporter Rachel Weiner, The Post briefly reported Monday that a real FBI raid had taken place. The story was updated about two hours later to note that the raid was a fabrication.  The story unfolded as a confluence of outright falsehoods by Burkman and Wohl coupled with lapses by Post journalists.  A purported neighbor of Burkman emailed a tip to the Post on Monday morning to report "a bunch of commotion" outside Burkman's house. "His house was being raided by the FBI," said the email, which included a link to photos and video of the alleged raid.  Burkman and Wohl later corroborated this version of events to The Post; Wohl said agents had taken computers, papers and cellphones.  Burkman is longtime conservative lobbyist and recent conspiracist. Together with Wohl, a 22-year-old former hedge fund manager...</description>

      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Trump-s-latest-indoor-rally-defies-state-health-15567097.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's first indoor rally in months was staged as a rebuke to Democrats he accuses of using coronavirus restrictions against him, but the campaign event in Nevada also prompted sharp denunciations from critics on Monday as a symbol of the president's handling of the covid-19 pandemic.  The Sunday-night gathering came as the pandemic has caused at least 190,000 deaths in the United States, with the number expected to pass 200,000 before Trump holds his next official campaign events on Friday. The Nov. 3 election had already become a referendum on the president's often dismissive approach to the pandemic before revelations last week that he had told Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward that he knew the severity of the virus but preferred to play it down in public.  "We are already making the turn. We're making that round, beautiful, last turn" to a post-pandemic economic recovery, Trump said during the rally in Henderson, Nev., although the nation has recovered only about half of the jobs lost since spring and 13.6 million workers remain unemployed.  On Monday, Trump held another indoor campaign event at a luxury hotel in Phoenix that was billed as a roundtable with Latino supporters. The White House pool reporter traveling with Trump described the scene as looking much like a rally, with more than 100 people crowded closely together in a ballroom. Television footage showed mask-free supporters waving campaign signs.  "I know this was supposed to be, you know the fake news, they said that this is supposed to be a roundtable, but it looks like a rally," Trump said. "But it is a rally because we love each other." He then added that "it is a roundtable."  Democratic nominee Joe Biden has made adherence to coronavirus rules a defining feature of his mostly virtual campaign. Although Trump...</description>

      <title>Health and Human Services spokesman warns of armed insurrection after election...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Health-and-Human-Services-spokesman-warns-of-15567068.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A top communications official for the administration's coronavirus response urged President Donald Trump's supporters to prepare for an armed insurrection after a contested election and accused government scientists of "sedition" in a Facebook Live chat that he described in detail to The Washington Post on Monday.  Michael Caputo, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, which is overseeing the coronavirus response, leveled the accusations and promoted other conspiracy theories in a Facebook Live event first reported by The New York Times. Caputo confirmed the authenticity of the video in comments he made to The Post.  "Since joining the administration my family and I have been continually threatened and in and out of criminal court dealing with harassment prosecutions," Caputo said in a statement. "This weighs heavily on us and we deeply appreciate the friendship and support of President Trump as we address these matters and keep our children safe."  Caputo's comments come as Trump administration officials say they are seeking to build public support for a coronavirus vaccine but have faced setbacks, most recently the release of audio in which the president admitted that he deliberately downplayed the virus when he knew it was "deadly."  Trump installed Caputo in April after considering whether to fire Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar over a series of damaging stories about Trump's handling of the pandemic, according to three current and former White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe behind-the-scenes discussions. Allies persuaded Trump to not make such a change amid a pandemic, but instead to bring in Caputo, the officials said. (Trump denied reports that he was considering firing Azar at the time.)

      <title>BICOASTAL BURN: Smoke from West Coast fires reaches DC...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/937474/smoke-from-west-coast-fires-reached-all-way-washington-dc</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;You've seen the harrowing images of West Coast skies this past week, as wildfires continue to rage across California, Oregon, and Washington. Now, the smoke that created that apocalyptic orange glow has moved across the country, though the air quality and appearance is nowhere near as drastic as in the Pacific states. The National Weather Service office in Sterling, Virginia, confirmed that the 'hazy appearance to the sky' in the Washington, D.C. area on Monday is a result of smoke from the western fires getting caught in the jet stream and floating swiftly toward the Atlantic. Wow-- smoke from the West Coast fires has reached DC https://t.co/gqGSN7qfoB — Jennifer Haberkorn (@jenhab) September 14, 2020 Indeed, both NASA and AirNow — which monitors U.S. air quality — predict the smoke plume area will stretch far and wide this week. Tim O'Donnell Here's a map from https://t.co/OB2UM7gO3H which approximates smoke plume area in gray... it's covering much of Lower 48, including DC area: pic.twitter.com/hIfBTRzLzT — Capital Weather Gang (@capitalweather) September 14, 2020 this smoke is coming for the east coast. https://t.co/uWCD9vyXpo — Tim Dickinson (@7im) September 14, 2020</description>
