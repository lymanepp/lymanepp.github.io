      <title>PAPER: Powell propping up economy!</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Jerome-Powell-is-propping-up-Trump-s-economy-14901352.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell isn't heeding President Donald Trump's demands to slash interest rates.  But the central bank chief still delivered unequivocal good news for Trump's reelection hopes: He doesn't see the Fed raising interest rates anytime soon, leaving in place the cushion it put under the economy earlier this year.  Powell, addressing reporters after the Fed's final meeting of a turbulent decade, predicted smoother sailing next year as Trump gears up to face voters. He said monetary policymakers "expect moderate growth to continue," at a slowed but still healthy 2% pace.  And he took some credit for helping navigate head winds from Trump's trade war and choppiness abroad, saying the Fed's three interest rate cuts over the summer and into the fall, for which he forged consensus among Fed officials, "kept the economy on track."  Indeed, the Fed's official statement - accompanying the announcement it is holding the benchmark interest rate steady between 1.5 and 1.75% - dropped its mention of "uncertainties" facing the economic outlook.  Per my The Washington Post: "Powell left the door open to changing interest rates in 2020, but he stressed there is a high bar for moving rates up or down. 'We're going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy,' Powell said. If there is a 'material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly.' "  Powell's presentation marked a heel turn from earlier this year. Stocks tanked in July after Powell described the Fed's first interest rate cut in a decade as a "mid-cycle adjustment," because investors interpreted the remark as a signal the relief monetary policymakers were providing was only temporary. Now, however, "the cuts look much more permanent," Grant Thornton chief economist Diane Swonk wrote in a note. "The vote to hold rates...</description>

      <title>Lab chimps were dumped on island and left to starve. He saved them...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/U-S-lab-chimps-were-dumped-on-Liberia-s-Monkey-14901091.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MONKEY ISLAND, Liberia - All was quiet when the motorboat puttered to a stop. Saltwater lapped at the narrow sandy shore. Mangrove leaves fluttered in the breeze. Then the man in a blue life jacket cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted: Hoo hoo!  Like a secret password, the call unlocked a hidden primate universe. Dozens of chimpanzees emerged from the brush, hairy arms extended. They waded up to the rusty vessel with the nonchalance of someone fetching the mail.  "Time to eat," said Joseph Thomas, their wiry guardian of 40 years, tossing bananas into the furry crowd.  Chimps aren't supposed to be stuck on their own island - especially one with no food - or mingle with much-weaker humans. But nothing about Liberia's Monkey Island is normal. It's a spectacle, an increasingly costly burden and the enduring legacy of American scientists who set out to cure hepatitis B in 1974.  Animal testing has existed since doctors in ancient Greece studied the anatomy of rodents - an estimated 115 million creatures are still used each year in research worldwide - but rarely is the aftermath so visible. Rarely is it so hungry.  This colony of 66 chimpanzees, which never learned to survive in the wild, eats roughly 500 pounds of produce each day, plus a weekly batch of hard-boiled eggs for protein. They rely on money from a charity abroad and the devotion of men who've known them since they lived in steel cages.  "That's Mabel," said Thomas, the captain of that small crew, pointing to a 100-pound female. "Look! She likes to wash her food in the water."  As if on cue, Mabel dunked her banana in the mud-brown river.  Thomas, 60, met the chimp, 36, when she was a baby who pressed the soft black pads of her fingers into his open palm.  The New York researchers who once injected her with...</description>

      <title>Harvey Reaches $25M Settlement With His Accusers...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Weinstein-and-His-Accusers-Reach-Tentative-25-14899445.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;After two years of legal wrangling, Harvey Weinstein and the board of his bankrupt film studio have reached a tentative $25 million settlement agreement with dozens of his alleged sexual misconduct victims, a deal that would not require the Hollywood producer to admit wrongdoing or pay anything to his accusers himself, according to lawyers involved in the negotiations.  The proposed global legal settlement has gotten preliminary approval from all the major parties involved, according to several of the lawyers. More than 30 actresses and former Weinstein employees, who in lawsuits have accused Weinstein of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape, would share in the payout - along with potential claimants who could join in coming months. The deal would bring to an end nearly every such lawsuit against him and his former company.  The settlement would require court approval and a final signoff by all parties. It would be paid by insurance companies representing the producer's former studio, the Weinstein Company. Because the business is in bankruptcy proceedings, the women have had to make their claims along with its creditors. The payout to the accusers would be part of an overall $47 million settlement intended to close out the company's obligations, according to a half-dozen lawyers, some of whom spoke about the proposed terms on the condition of anonymity.  Representatives for Weinstein declined to comment. Lawyers did not respond to requests for comment for board members and other parties.  Weinstein is scheduled to be tried in New York in early January on charges of sexual assault involving two women. While his criminal prosecution has drawn public attention, the largely hidden negotiations over civil claims have been far more consequential for many of his accusers, who include women from the United...</description>
