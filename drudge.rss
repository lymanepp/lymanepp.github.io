      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/How-two-housekeepers-took-on-the-president-and-14882448.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEDMINSTER TOWNSHIP, N.J. - It was important for Sandra Diaz to be invisible.  Before entering the Trump family villa, she would tie back her hair, pull on latex gloves and step into delicate paper shoe coverings. She knew not to wear makeup or perfume that might leave the faintest trace of her presence.  As Donald Trump's personal maid, Diaz was dealing with a fussy celebrity owner who presided like a monarch over the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster long before he was elevated to president. She was an immigrant from Costa Rica working illegally for Trump with a fake Social Security card she had bought for $50. Being invisible was her life's work.  Moving quickly through the two-story house in the mornings, Diaz carried out Trump's fastidious instructions. In his closet, she would hang six sets of identical golf outfits: six white polo shirts, six pairs of beige pants, six neatly ironed pairs of boxer shorts. She would smear a dollop of Trump's liquid face makeup on the back of her hand to make sure it hadn't dried out.  The years of service that Diaz and other undocumented immigrant housekeepers, cooks, landscapers, greenskeepers, waiters, bellhops, farm hands and caddies devoted to the Trump Organization have given them a remarkable vantage point into the unvarnished lives of the now-first family. They have seen poolside tantrums and holiday arguments. They've laughed with the in-laws and watched after the grandkids.  Their recollections also show how Trump's entrance into presidential politics - denouncing illegal immigrants as criminals and job-stealers - upended their lives and prompted some of them to publicly confront their former boss.  Over the past year, The Washington Post has spoken with 48 people who had worked illegally for the Trump Organization at 11 of its properties in Florida, New Jersey, New York...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-rejects-Nixon-Clinton-precedent-on-14881575.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The showdown had been years in the making, Bill Clinton's personal lawyer confronting the lead investigator pushing for the second ever impeachment of a sitting president.  "Mr. Starr, good evening," David Kendall, the presidential attorney, said in November 1998.  "Good evening," replied Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel investigating Clinton. "How are you, David?"  "I'm very well, Ken," Kendall said.  For the next hour the two legal giants squared off in a prime-time clash exactly a month before the House voted to impeach President Clinton for his effort to cover up an affair with a White House intern. They debated the facts of the case and the merits of impeachment, as both Republicans and Democrats barely said a word.  It was the sort of legal battle royal that President Donald Trump would probably love to see from his legal team, feisty and carried live on national cable TV.  But Trump, unlike Clinton and President Richard Nixon in 1974, has opted against having legal advisers present for the House Judiciary Committee's first impeachment hearing Wednesday.  The White House decision, delivered to Democrats Sunday evening, accused them of a "complete lack of due process" but left open the possibility that his legal team "may consider participating" in future hearings if they are deemed a true process.  That move relinquishes Trump's side of the fight to Republicans on the committee, an unusual move for a president who loves to see his own top aides in public sparring with Democrats and the media. Many of those GOP lawmakers are his closest allies, and they plan to vigorously fight Democrats over committee procedures.  Some Republicans have quietly wondered whether this is a mistake, that it leaves out another combatant in the room who would be on Trump's...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was most certainly not a good idea. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor turned lawyer to President Trump turned linchpin of this whole impeachment situation, is back in Ukraine while the House debates the impeachment of his boss. And not only that, but he's there to talk to multiple former Ukrainian prosecutors who sparked a lot of his problems in the first place, people familiar with his efforts tell The New York Times. As the House continues its investigation of Trump, Giuliani, and their dealings with Ukraine, Giuliani has been overseas in an effort to 'shift the focus to purported wrongdoing by President Trumpâ€™s political rivals,' the Times writes. On Tuesday, he reportedly met with former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko in Budapest. Lutsenko is one of the prosecutors accused of ignoring corruption in Ukraine's government and had once been skeptical of the Bidens' dealings in Ukraine before recanting his suspicions. Trump seemed to praise Lutsenko as a 'very good prosecutor' during his July 25 call with Ukraine's president, who had dismissed Lutsenko. Then on Wednesday, as the House Judiciary Committee began its impeachment hearings with legal experts, Giuliani reportedly headed to Kyiv in Ukraine to meet other ex-prosecutors who targeted the Bidens. They included Viktor Shokin, who was pushed out of his position amid criticism from then-Vice President Joe Biden, and Kostiantyn Kulyk, who led the investigation into Burisma. All of the information Giuliani gathers is apparently going into 'episodes of a documentary series for a conservative television outlet promoting his pro-Trump, anti-impeachment narrative,' the Times continues.

The morning show devoted almost five minutes to promoting a glossy new book singing the praises of the corporate behemoth. Dismissing her own program as nothing more than a product no different then co-division Marvel, co-host Robin Roberts cheered, “It is called One Day at Disney and it celebrates the people and the culture that makes all this happen from Walt Disney world to Marvel to GMA.”</description>

      <title>France braces for massive strikes and transportation disruptions..</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/France-braces-for-massive-strikes-and-14881005.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARIS -France is bracing for major transportation disruptions throughout the country starting Thursday, as trade unions launch a strike in response to changes President Emmanuel Macron wants to make to the country's retirement system.  Much of the Paris Metro will be shut down, as will many national and international train lines, including certain Eurostar services. Flights will also be canceled, as air traffic controllers say they will join the protests through Saturday.  Strikes and protests, of course, are a well-known fixture of French life, from the student uprisings of 1968 to the "yellow vest" demonstrations against inequality that stunned the French government last year with their vigor and violence. No other Western democracy seems to have as high a tolerance for burning cars and broken windows.  But these protests could be bigger and more destabilizing than most.  Macron is playing with political fire: The retirement system is a beloved feature of France's famously generous welfare state.  The last time the French government seriously tried to overhaul it, in 1995, protests paralyzed the country for more than three weeks and forced then-President Jacques Chirac to back down and accept a stinging political defeat.  And although French transport unions largely steered clear of the yellow vest demonstrations over the past year, they are expressing the same anger that certain segments of the population have been abandoned by their leaders.  Yellow vest protesters could join these demonstrations. Teachers unions, postal workers, hospital workers and the police may also support the strikes.  "It's the coalition of all frustrations, and it demonstrates the isolation of the elite, the isolation of the president, even the personal rejection of Macron," said Dominique...</description>
