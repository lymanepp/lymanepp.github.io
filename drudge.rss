      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/california-wildfires/article/Smoke-from-deadly-Camp-Fire-still-blankets-Bay-13384133.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smoke from the deadly Camp Fire in Paradise is still drifting into the Bay Area, prompting public health officials to send out renewed alerts about air quality and urge residents to stay indoors. On Monday morning, an orange "unhealthy air" alert went out across the entire region, as air quality indexes range from 101 to 124, according to Bay Area Air Quality Management District. The polluted air is especially unhealthy for those with sensitive heart and lung conditions. Fine particles drifting in from the wildfire burning in Butte County can accumulate in the body to cause persistent coughing, difficulty breathing and reductions in lung function, according to the California Department of Public Health.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Robert and Jessica Meinhofer told friends they were moving into an RV in 2015, most thought they were crazy. The questions poured in: How could they go from living in a 2,000-square-foot home to living in a 250-square-foot trailer? What would they do with their stuff? What would their children, ages 6 and 9, do for school? Was this a midlife crisis? The hardest people to convince were Jessica's parents, who grew up in an impoverished Latino neighborhood in the Bronx and worked hard so their daughter could have a better life. They couldn't understand why the couple wanted to live like migrant laborers. The Meinhofers are doing this by choice, not financial desperation.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — The campers, some clad in combat fatigues, carefully aim their assault rifles. Their instructor offers advice: Don't think of your target as a human being. So when these boys and girls shoot, they will shoot to kill. Most are in their teens, but some are as young as 8 years old. They are at a summer camp created by one of Ukraine's radical nationalist groups, hidden in a forest in the west of the country, that was visited by The Associated Press. The camp has two purposes: to train children to defend their country from Russians and their sympathizers — and to spread nationalist ideology.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARADISE, Calif. (AP) — Authorities called in a mobile DNA lab and anthropologists to help identify the dead as the search went on for victims of the most destructive wildfire in California history. The overall death toll from the outbreak of fires at both ends of the state stood at 25 Sunday and appeared likely to rise. The worst of the blazes was in Northern California, where flames reduced the town of Paradise, population 27,000, to a smoking ruin days ago and continued to rage in surrounding communities. The number of people killed in that fire alone, at least 23, made it the third-deadliest on record in the state.</description>

As Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and dozens of other heads of state and government listened in silence, French President Emmanuel Macron used the occasion, as its host, to sound a powerful and sobering warning about the fragility of peace and the dangers of nationalism and of nations that put themselves first, above the collective good.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The first election workers are recounting ballots Sunday in Florida's bitterly close races for the U.S. Senate and governor, ramping up their efforts after the secretary of state ordered a review of the two nationally watched contests. Miami-Dade County election officials began feeding ballots into scanning machines Saturday evening. The tedious work in that one South Florida county alone could take days, considering some 800,000 ballots were cast. Multiply that by 67 counties in the nation's third-most populous state, and the scope of the task was beginning to sink in Sunday.</description>
