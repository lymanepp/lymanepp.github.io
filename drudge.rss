      <description>&lt;b&gt;news.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emmanuel Macron may have seen off far-right leader Marine Le Pen, but his second term could be even rockier than the first with mounting political opposition and boiling social discontent. As his supporters savoured a hard-earned re-election at a rally by the Eiffel Tower on Sunday, Macron acknowledged in his victory speech that many people who voted for him did so to block Le Pen and not because they support his ideas.

It signifies, however, that Twitter is now exploring whether a sale of the company to Musk is possible on attractive terms, the sources added.</description>
