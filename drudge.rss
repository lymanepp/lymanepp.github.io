      <title>TWITTER CEO Holding Closed-Door Meeting With Trump...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trump-meets-with-Twitter-CEO-at-the-White-House-13789622.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump on Tuesday met privately with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, a huddle at the White House between one of the site's most prolific users and an executive who's faced criticism for the way Twitter has handled the president's tweets.  The meeting comes as Trump continues to attack the tech industry, threatening to regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter out of concern that they censor conservatives online - allegations that those companies deny. Hours before sitting down with Dorsey, Trump had singled out Twitter for playing "political games" with his nearly 60 million followers.  A significant portion of the meeting focused on Trump's concerns that Twitter quietly, and deliberately, has limited or removed some of his followers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation who requested anonymity because it was private. Trump said he had heard from fellow conservatives who had lost followers for unclear reasons as well.  But Twitter long has explained that follower figures fluctuate as the company takes action to remove fraudulent spam accounts. In the meeting, Dorsey stressed that point, noting that even he had lost followers as part of Twitter's work to enforce its policies, according to the source.  Asked about the meeting, the White House did not respond to a request for comment.  In a statement, Twitter said the meeting- initiated by the president - focused on "protecting the health of the public conversation ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections and efforts underway to respond to the opioid crisis."  Twitter partners with the federal government on a program to encourage Americans to dispose of prescription drugs they no longer need to prevent against abuse.  In March, Trump accused Silicon Valley's largest companies of harboring a "hatred" for...</description>

      <title>How NEST allowed hackers in...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/How-Nest-designed-to-keep-intruders-out-of-13788592.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tara Thomas thought her daughter was just having nightmares. "There's a monster in my room," the almost-3-year-old would say, sometimes pointing to the green light on the Nest Cam installed on the wall above her bed.  Then Thomas realized her daughter's nightmares were real. In August, she walked into the room and heard pornography playing through the Nest Cam, which she had used for years as a baby monitor in their Novato, California, home. Hackers, whose voices could be heard faintly in the background, were playing the recording, using the intercom feature in the software. "I'm really sad I doubted my daughter," she said.  Though it would be nearly impossible to find out who was behind it, a hack like this one doesn't require much effort, for two reasons: Software designed to help people break into websites and devices has gotten so easy to use that it's practically child's play, and many companies, including Nest, have effectively chosen to let some hackers slip through the cracks rather than impose an array of inconvenient countermeasures that could will detract from their users' experience and ultimately alienate their customers.  The result is that anyone in the world with an internet connection and rudimentary skills has the ability to virtually break into homes through devices designed to keep physical intruders out.  As hacks such as the one the Thomases suffered become public, tech companies are deciding between user convenience and potential damage to their brands. Nest could make it more difficult for hackers to break into Nest cameras, for instance, by making the log-in process more cumbersome. But doing so would introduce what Silicon Valley calls "friction" - anything that can slow down or stand in the way of someone using a product.  At the same time, tech companies pay a reputational price for each...</description>

      <title>Rival politicians accused each other of using drugs. Result was showdown at urinalysis lab...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Rival-politicians-accused-each-other-of-using-13787781.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been described as a "political pissing contest" - literally.  Two feuding politicians in Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city, spent much of the past week accusing each other of being on mind-altering substances after getting into an ugly fight in the comments section of a local political blog.  Naturally, they could settle their dispute only one way: by challenging each other to a public drug test.  Calling it a "modern twist on the classic political duel," the Connecticut Post reported on Monday that Bridgeport City Councilman Ernest Newton and Board of Education member Maria Pereira had both handed over plastic cups of urine and passed their respective tests.  As it turns out, they're not the first ones to go through the humiliating ritual. Both front-runners in Ukraine's presidential election submitted to live-streamed drug tests earlier this month, and the state of Georgia once made screenings mandatory for candidates running for state office. Some elected officials apparently think the practice should be even more widespread: In September, one Republican lawmaker introduced a proposal to randomly drug test all members of Congress.  In Bridgeport, the showdown took place voluntarily after Newton and Pereira, both Democrats, began sniping at each other over a news item about budget figures that had been posted to Only In Bridgeport, a widely read site dedicated to discussing the city's often-colorful politics.  "Please remember to take your meds," Newton, the city councilman, wrote to Pereira on April 13.  Pereira, the school board member, hit back. "Ernie, I promise I will continue to take any and all prescribed medicine," she replied. "In turn, please ensure you take anything you need that may have to be swallowed, snorted, inhaled, or injected."  The remark had...</description>
