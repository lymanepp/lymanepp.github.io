      <title>Merry Christmas, you're being impeached... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Merry-Christmas-you-re-being-impeached-14912970.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Bill Clinton stood at a lectern in the Rose Garden, surrounded by supporters, including his wife, first lady Hillary Clinton. The votes had been counted, and the news had arrived: He was being impeached.  "I hope there will be a constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a prompt manner," he said. "Meanwhile, I will continue to do the work of the American people."  He decried the "excessive partisanship" and "obsessive animosity" of the day. Then he turned around, shook hands, walked back into the White House and threw a Christmas party.  In an amazing episode of "history repeats itself," the House is expected to vote to impeach President Donald Trump on Dec. 18 - one day short of the 21st anniversary of the House voting to impeach Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. Both arrived awkwardly in the holiday season known for "glad tidings" and "goodwill toward men."  Clinton wasn't the only one attempting holiday merriment that day in 1998. In the Capitol, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who chaired the House Judiciary Committee overseeing the impeachment at the time, scheduled the committee's holiday party for the same time as the impeachment vote. (The vote was later moved from Thursday to Saturday.)  Some Democrats were offended by the double-booking, The New York Times reported.  "It should do wonders for holiday cheer," Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., said sarcastically.  In the halls of the Capitol, CNN correspondent Bob Franken struggled to be heard on-air over a boombox blasting "O Tannenbaum."  And it wasn't just Dec. 19 where impeachment and the holidays intertwined. Ten days earlier, at the very moment Clinton lit the National Christmas Tree, House Republicans unveiled their four articles of impeachment against the president. (Only two were passed by the...</description>
