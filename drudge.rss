      <title>Surge of Mexican migrants new challenge for border crackdown...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Surge-of-Mexican-migrants-is-new-challenge-for-14544007.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sudden increase in the number of Mexican families and asylum seekers trying to cross into the United States has raised fears of a new border crisis, frustrating Department of Homeland Security officials who are unable to deter Mexican nationals with the same restrictive immigration policies designed to keep Central Americans out of the country.  Mexico surpassed Guatemala and Honduras in August to again become the single-largest source of unauthorized migration to the United States, according to administration officials who provided data on the Mexican migrants but were not authorized to speak about the situation publicly. In recent weeks, thousands of Mexican adults and children have been camping out in queues at U.S. border crossings, sleeping in tents while awaiting a chance to apply for safe refuge.  Most concerning to U.S. authorities is the percentage of Mexicans declaring a fear of persecution or harm, a claim that typically prevents their rapid deportation. Their requests for asylum are adding to the backlog of nearly one million pending cases in U.S. immigration courts, and by law, the United States must process their claims.  Neither the government of Mexico nor the Trump administration has publicly acknowledged the sudden change, a trend that threatens to shatter the fragile detente between the U.S. president and Mexican leader Andrés Manuel López Obrador.  The number of Mexican adults arrested along the border jumped by about 25 percent from the end of July to the end of September, a period when migration from Guatemala, Honduras and Salvadoran continued to decline, according to the latest statistics obtained by The Washington Post. The number of Mexican family groups taken into custody also surged, officials said.  Many of the migrant Mexican families say they are escaping corruption and flaring drug...</description>

      <title>'Get over it'...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Analysis-Mulvaney-s-twin-admissions-put-Trump-at-14543135.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - First came the lengthy infomercial touting President Donald Trump's private golf resort in Florida as "far and away the best" site in the country to host next year's Group of Seven summit of world leaders. Then, an admission: Trump did, in fact, withhold aid to Ukraine because he wanted the government there to investigate Democrats.  For 39 minutes Thursday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney turned the press briefing room into a sort of confession chamber, openly admitting to several acts that could deepen the legal predicament for the president. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry into whether he has abused his office for personal and political gain.  Mulvaney's retort to those charges came in a three-word mantra that now forms the central theme of the White House impeachment response: "Get over it."  In admitting that Trump had personally intervened to award a multimillion-dollar summit to his own company, and that the president had also used taxpayer money as leverage to push a Ukrainian investigation into Democrats, Mulvaney embraced a classic Trumpian tactic: saying the quiet - and potentially illegal - part out loud.  But that strategy with regard to Ukraine came in for withering criticism after Mulvaney's appearance, and he later tried to walk back his comments. In a statement late Thursday, Mulvaney denied the quid pro quo he had previously defended as appropriate and normal.  While Mulvaney came to the briefing room to announce the 2020 G-7 site, his most significant comments came when he described why Trump had intervened over the summer to block nearly $400 million in aid Congress had appropriated for Ukraine. Democrats are probing Trump's unorthodox Ukraine policy as part of their impeachment investigation, and several members of Trump's administration have said they were...</description>
