      <title>White House hopes Americans will grow numb to toll...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/923821/white-house-reportedly-hoping-americans-grow-numb-covid19-death-toll</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As new COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise in the United States, White House officials are reportedly crossing their fingers that Americans will simply get used to it. President Trump's advisers are looking to 'reframe' his coronavirus pandemic response, and they want to 'convince Americans that they can live with the virus,' with White House officials hoping 'Americans will grow numb to the escalating death toll and learn to accept tens of thousands of new cases a day,' The Washington Post reports. One senior administration official said Americans will have to 'live with the virus being a threat,' while a former official told the Post, 'They're of the belief that people will get over it or if we stop highlighting it, the base will move on and the public will learn to accept 50,000 to 100,000 new cases a day.' Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently said the U.S. could soon reach this shockingly high number of 100,000 new cases a day while also warning that the final death toll will be 'very disturbing.' The U.S. has reported almost 130,000 deaths from COVID-19 and has been setting records for the number of new cases per day. NBC News similarly reports the White House is preparing a new message on COVID-19 that the country must 'learn to live with it.' Trump has faced a declining approval rating during the pandemic, with Bloomberg reporting on Monday that support for Trump 'is slipping fastest in the 500 counties where the number of cases have been more than 28 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people.' Meanwhile, the Post reports that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaign plans to keep attacking Trump for his COVID-19 response, arguing that, as one adviser put it to the Post, 'the country would be in a much different place today ... if Joe Biden had been the president in January.'

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/China-detains-leading-critic-of-President-Xi-15388052.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TAIPEI, Taiwan - Chinese police on Monday seized the Tsinghua University professor and essayist Xu Zhangrun, silencing one of the last voices within China's besieged intellectual circles who dared to openly and persistently criticize President Xi Jinping's leadership.  Xu's arrest in Beijing's outskirts came five months after he published a lengthy essay pleading with political leaders to conduct an open investigation into the coverup of the covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan and reverse the country's spiral into tyranny. What began as a local outbreak was exacerbated by a political system that stifled whistleblowers and "a rot that goes right up to Beijing," Xu wrote in his February piece, which he predicted would be "the last piece I write."  Friends in Beijing, some speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said Xu was taken away early Monday. A widely circulated statement on social media from Xu's friends, which could not be independently confirmed, said Xu's home was surrounded by 20 police officers, who took away Xu and his computer.  Tsinghua University's Law Department, where Xu taught constitutional law until he was demoted last year for his political writing, said Monday it was "not clear" about Xu's situation. Beijing's public security department declined to comment.  One friend who met Xu on Saturday said the professor was in high spirits as he gathered with friends after weeks of isolation; Xu had been barred from leaving his home during the politically sensitive month of June, when some dissidents commemorate the anniversary of the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, but did not seem to be under an unusual degree of pressure.  But Xu's arrest was not wholly unexpected, coming at a time when the Communist Party is forcefully reasserting itself not only globally - over territorial disputes...</description>
