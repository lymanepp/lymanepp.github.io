      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jet lag can put the brakes on the most exciting vacations. Almost everyone who has ever flown across time zones knows what it feels like. The experience ranks somewhere between eating day-old cooked oatmeal and nursing a hangover. These food and drink metaphors aren't just a coincidence. Jet lag, it turns out, affects more than our sleep; it affects our internal organs as well. Given what is known about the importance of intestinal bacteria (called the microbiome) and their connection to immune function and well-being, it's clear that any discussion of jet lag, and how to deal with it, needs to consider "gut lag"as well.</description>
