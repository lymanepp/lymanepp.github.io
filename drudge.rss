      <title>White House struggles to contain public alarm...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/White-House-struggles-to-contain-public-alarm-15084160.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told The Washington Post late Monday that investors should consider "buying these dips" in the stock market amid the coronavirus panic. The message was to take advantage of one-day slumps and "buy low."  After all, the Dow Jones industrial average had just fallen 1,032 points. President Donald Trump tweeted similar guidance thousands of miles away in India.  Less than 24 hours later, the Dow Jones industrial average would fall another 879 points, bringing Trump and Kudlow's economic advice - at least in the short term - under greater scrutiny.  The rosy sheen that Trump, Kudlow, and other White House officials have tried to express about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak has now collided with reality: The coronavirus is spreading, quickly, to more countries. The death toll is rising, and the outbreak is wreaking havoc on global supply chains. Efforts to detect and contain it have failed.  And the White House's efforts to contain and control government messaging on the disease have come under attack. Trump is highly concerned about the market and has encouraged aides not to give predictions that might cause further tremors. He is expected to talk to officials on Wednesday, said aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.  At least publicly, Trump has devoted the majority of his public statements to slamming Democrats or complaining about the criminal justice system. But he has not publicly engaged much about the coronavirus, other than to downplay what he believes the impact will be on the United States. Privately, Trump has become furious about the stock market's slide, according to two people familiar with the president's thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal details.  While he has...</description>

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/898098/sp-500-suffers-2day-drop-not-seen-since-2008</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day after President Trump tweeted that the stock market is 'starting to look very good to me,' the markets once again took a dive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 879 points on Tuesday after the Centers for Disease Control came out with a dire warning about the coronavirus, saying its community spread in the United States appeared inevitable and Americans should be ready for the potential of major disruptions in their lives, CNBC reports. Additionally, the S&amp;P 500 on Tuesday fell about 3 percent, and CNBC notes that 'the last time the S&amp;P 500 fell more than 3 percent two days in a row was in November of 2008 during the financial crisis,' citing Bespoke Investment Group. Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said Tuesday that the coronavirus spreading in the U.S. is 'not so much of a question of if' but rather 'a question of when,' and 'we are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad,' The New York Times reports. This came after the Dow on Tuesday plunged 1,031 points in what NBC notes was its worst performance in two years. Brendan Morrow</description>
