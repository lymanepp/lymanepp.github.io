## What the Bible Says About Same-Sex Attraction

The topic of same-sex attraction has garnered significant attention in recent years, both within and outside Christian circles. For those seeking to understand the biblical perspective, it's important to approach the Scriptures with clarity and context. This blog post aims to provide a thorough examination of what the Bible says about same-sex attraction, focusing on key passages and their interpretations.

The biblical view holds that same-sex attraction, while not chosen, is a result of the Fall and is contrary to God’s design for human sexuality. These desires are considered disordered because they seek fulfillment outside the natural order established by God for human relationships. Romans 1:26-27 refers to same-sex desires as "dishonorable passions" and "contrary to nature," framing them as disordered in relation to God’s intended order.

### Old Testament Passages

- **Genesis 19:1-29 – The Story of Sodom and Gomorrah**  
  The account of Sodom and Gomorrah is one of the earliest references to same-sex attraction in the Bible. In Genesis 19, two angels visit the city of Sodom, and the men of the city surround Lot’s house, demanding to have sexual relations with the visitors. Lot’s refusal and the subsequent destruction of the city are often cited in discussions on same-sex attraction.

  While this passage clearly depicts same-sex sexual intent as part of the wickedness of Sodom, it is important to note that the sin of Sodom was multifaceted, including arrogance, lack of hospitality, and social injustice (Ezekiel 16:49-50). However, the specific act of same-sex sexual intent is highlighted as a grievous sin.

- **Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13**  
  These two verses in Leviticus provide direct prohibitions against same-sex sexual acts:

  Leviticus 18:22: "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination."

  Leviticus 20:13: "If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them."

  These verses are part of the Holiness Code, a section of Leviticus that outlines various laws meant to distinguish the Israelites from the surrounding nations. The use of the word "abomination" (Hebrew: to'ebah) indicates that this behavior is seen as morally detestable in God's eyes.

### New Testament Passages

- **Romans 1:26-27**  
  In Romans, the Apostle Paul discusses the moral decay of humanity, stating: "For this reason, God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error."

  This passage is often cited as a New Testament condemnation of acting on same-sex desires. Paul describes such behavior as "contrary to nature" and "shameless," indicating that it is inconsistent with God’s design for human sexuality.

- **1 Corinthians 6:9-10**  
  In this passage, Paul lists behaviors that are incompatible with inheriting the kingdom of God: "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."

  The phrase "men who practice homosexuality" is translated from two Greek words: *malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*. While there is debate about the precise meanings, it is generally understood that these terms refer to different aspects of same-sex sexual behavior.

- **1 Timothy 1:9-10**  
  Another Pauline passage lists "those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine." Here, acting on same-sex desires is grouped with other sins, emphasizing its incompatibility with Christian teaching.

### Understanding the Biblical Context

When examining these passages, it is crucial to consider the broader biblical context. The Bible consistently presents sexual relations as intended to be within the bounds of marriage between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6). Acting on same-sex attraction is viewed as a deviation from this design.

Additionally, the Bible's teachings on same-sex attraction must be understood within the context of its overall message of sin and redemption. All humans are considered sinful (Romans 3:23), and the gospel offers forgiveness and transformation through Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 6:11).

### Christian Response and Conclusion

The biblical stance on same-sex attraction is clear: it is considered a result of the fallen human condition and is contrary to God’s design. However, it is also important to recognize that the Bible calls Christians to respond to all sin with both truth and grace. This means upholding biblical teachings while also extending love and compassion to individuals, recognizing that all are in need of God's grace.

In a world where views on sexuality are rapidly changing, Christians are called to stand firm in biblical truth while also embodying Christ’s love. The Bible’s message is not just about condemning sin but about offering redemption and new life to all who turn to God in repentance and faith.

In conclusion, the Bible clearly presents acting on same-sex attraction as contrary to God’s design and will. However, it also calls believers to engage with others with love and compassion, reflecting the heart of the gospel.
