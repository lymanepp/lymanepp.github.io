      <title>CORTEZ CORNERED:  Rips Pelosi for 'singling out newly elected women of color' ...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/852117/alexandria-ocasiocortez-rips-nancy-pelosi-singling-newly-elected-women-color</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has made enemies of a few more Democratic newcomers. In an interview with The New York Times published Saturday, Pelosi pushed back against Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Ohmar (D-Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) for their opposition to a largely bipartisan border spending bill, referring to them just "four people." Now, Ocasio-Cortez has suggested there's a racial motivation to Pelosi's words. Pelosi has often rejected the will of progressive newcomers, and in an interview with The Washington Post published Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez said she "understood" that was "to protect more moderate members." But this "persistent singling out" has become "just outright disrespectful .â€‰.â€‰. the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color," Ocasio-Cortez added. Ocasio-Cortez's comment comes after she and her self-described "squad" pushed for amendments to a Republican-led bill that directed emergency funding to the border, received some compromises, and still voted against it. The bill still passed because despite having "their public whatever and their Twitter world," the freshmen representatives are just "four people and thatâ€™s how many votes they got," Pelosi told The New York Times. Pelosi also reportedly told a closed-door meeting Wednesday that Democrats can't just "tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just okay," per the Post. Yet as Politico Playbook describes it, Pelosi's words weren't meant as an insult. To Pelosi, "if you are one person who controls 20 votes, you're powerful," and everyone else is just a "normal member," Politico writes. Those supposedly offensive comments, as Politico puts it, are simply "a reflection of a reality under which [Pelosi] operates." Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>363-foot projection of rocket will be flashed on Washington Monument to celebrate Apollo 11 anniversary...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-363-foot-projection-of-a-rocket-will-be-flashed-14088032.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A 363-foot projection of a rocket will be flashed on one side of the Washington Monument next week to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing.  The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum is sponsoring a series of events to honor the Apollo 11 mission of July 20, 1969. The mission, which launched astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins from Earth on a Saturn V rocket, culminated with Aldrin and Armstrong successfully landing on the moon.  Part of the commemoration includes "Apollo 50 Festival" live performances, exhibits and speakers. The events will take place July 18-20 on the Mall.  As part of the celebration, the image of a 363-foot Saturn V rocket will be projected on the east side of the Washington Monument.  There will also be a free show that will have "archival footage to re-create the launch of Apollo 11 and tell the story of the first moon landing," according to Smithsonian officials. The show will also have a "re-creation of the famous Kennedy Space Center countdown clock."  Viewers can see the show from areas on the Mall in front of the Smithsonian Castle.  The event is being sponsored by the Air and Space Museum along with the Department of the Interior and will be produced by 59 Productions, which has handled the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games and other high-profile events.  In a statement, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said: "Almost 50 years ago, the Apollo 11 mission captivated the world as two American astronauts were the first to step foot on the moon, forever changing space exploration."</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The women at the Belgian nonprofit Femma decided quickly how to spend their new free time. Onetook up Spanish classes. Another studied flamenco dance. A senior manager revived her interest in art crafts.  Four years ago, the feminist advocacy organization polled its 60,000 female members on their biggest frustrations. The results were remarkably consistent, regardless of age: The women wanted more free time. Between work and their disproportionate share of the household and child-care responsibilities, the women reported having little time for themselves.  So as a one-year experiment starting in January, Femma implemented a 30-hour workweek for its approximately 60-person staff, which effectively means most take their Fridays off. The employees are being closely followed through December by Free University of Brussels researchers, who are studying the impact of more leisure time on both the women and their children.  "Our colleagues are very happy with this new situation; they're experiencing a lot more freedom," said Eva Brumagne, the director of the Belgian nonprofit, who has started a book club focused on modern literature. "They have a much more balanced life, new hobbies and are spending more time with their children. People are saying their lives have slowed down."  Femma's experiment comes as part of a new push across much of Europe to reduce working hours, including through a four-day workweek. For much of this decade, the idea of a four-day week has been primarily championed by industry executives in certain business niches - like those in software development or sales - as a way to boost employee morale and hourly productivity.  But over the past several years, particularly in Europe, trade unions, leftist organizations and some academics have increasingly called for a far broader, economy-wide transition to...</description>

      <title>White House pushes Congress to strike budget deal amid risk of fiscal pileup...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/Twin-challenges-on-budget-trade-test-withering-14085209.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The White House is pushing congressional leaders to strike a spending deal and increase the debt limit in the next two or three weeks, jolted by a recent report that found the Treasury Department was running out of cash much faster than previously forecasted.  But the talks have bogged down amid acrimony between Democrats and the White House, and now Washington's leaders run the risk of a fiscal pileup that could also imperil President Donald Trump's effort to update the North American Free Trade Agreement.  White House officials have said the debt ceiling must be raised by early September to ensure the government can pay its bills. And spending on many federal programs expires at the end of September, requiring a separate deal to prevent a government shutdown.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin consulted with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., this week and met Wednesday with GOP leaders, alongside acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, trying to forge a solution. Pelosi has made clear that any increase in the federal debt limit should come as part of a broader, two-year budget deal - an approach also favored by leading Senate Republicans - but it's far from clear whether lawmakers and the administration will be able to reach such an agreement before Congress leaves town for its annual summer recess in August.  The debt ceiling "is something we're having discussions about, updating the numbers and potentially the need to do something before everybody leaves" for the August recess, Mnuchin told reporters after exiting a meeting in the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Wednesday evening."We just want it passed. We don't care how it's passed," Mnuchin added when asked if the administration would prefer a stand-alone vote on the debt ceiling, as opposed to packaging it with a larger...</description>

      <title>Britain's special relationship with America in tatters as ambassador quits...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-US-UK-special-relationship-is-in-tatters-14085815.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The once "special relationship" between the United States and Great Britain is in tatters, shredded by the fallout from the 2016 Brexit referendum and President Donald Trump's determination to intervene in the politics of another country. If it improves, it likely will be on terms set by the president.  Wednesday's resignation under fire by Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the United States, represents a new low point in recent relations between the two countries. Leaked cables from Darroch back to his government that included critical comments about Trump and his administration were the ambassador's undoing. Trump saw an opportunity to embarrass the British government and drive the wedge more firmly between the two countries.  Darroch's resignation has caused an understandable uproar in Britain. Ahead of his decision to resign, he received strong support from outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May. In the aftermath of his letter of resignation, he has received an outpouring of praise from many others in the government, who said he had acted with utmost professionalism in providing candid analysis of the state of affairs in Washington. They blamed the leaker for taking revenge against the government.  But what Darroch lacked, in the face of the attacks from Trump, was a strong endorsement from the man now favored to succeed May in No. 10 Downing Street. Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and former foreign secretary, is the odds-on favorite to win the race for leadership of the Conservative Party against Jeremy Hunt, the current foreign secretary.  In a leadership debate, Johnson demurred when asked about Darroch's status and what it might be under a Johnson government. With Trump declaring that he would no longer do business with Darroch, and Johnson declining to give the ambassador standup backing, Darroch...</description>

      <title>Speaker's isolation gambit leaves four libs struggling...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Regrets-is-not-what-I-do-Pelosi-defends-her-14085447.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi admonished Democrats for personally attacking one another, warning in a closed-door meeting Wednesday that the party's fracturing was jeopardizing its majority.  Without naming names, her target was clear: the four liberal freshmen known as "the Squad."  "You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it. But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK," Pelosi, D-Calif., told Democrats.  But "the Squad" - Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts - is convinced it is Pelosi who is being the bully.  The four are struggling with the speaker's moves to isolate them in recent weeks, according to interviews with the lawmakers, congressional aides and allies. Pelosi has made at least half-dozen remarks dismissing the group or their far-left proposals on the environment and health care. More recently she scorned their lonely opposition to the party's emergency border bill last month.  And she defended those comments Wednesday, saying, "I have no regrets about anything. Regrets is not what I do," doubling down on her claim that the group has little power in the House.  "When these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm's distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood," Ocasio-Cortez told The Washington Post. "But the persistent singling out . . . it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful . . . the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color."  The four women are trying to figure out how to respond, texting one another and weighing whether to confront Pelosi to ask her to stop. But for now, they are focused...</description>
