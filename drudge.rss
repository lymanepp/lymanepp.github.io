      <title>Mormon valedictorian comes out in graduation speech...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/I-am-proud-to-be-a-gay-son-of-God-Mormon-13803233.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints considers same-sex marriage to be a "serious transgression" - and, until this spring, treated Mormons involved in these unions as apostates, subject to church disciplinary hearings that could result in their excommunication.  So a commencement ceremony on Friday at Brigham Young University, the flagship academic institution of the Mormon Church, was an unlikely occasion for this pronouncement: "I stand before my family, friends and graduating class today to say that I am proud to be a gay son of God."  The affirmation came from Matthew Easton, 24, who was being celebrated as the valedictorian in the political science department - and the graduating senior chosen to deliver remarks at the ceremony for the College of Family, Home, and Social Sciences.  Held up as a model for his classmates, he spoke plainly about the part of him that his church finds less commendable. Before an audience of about 10,000 - which included family members to whom he had not disclosed his sexuality - Easton asserted his value and his role in divine intent.  "I am not broken," he declared. "I am loved and important to the plan of our great creator. Each of us are."  Among the audience members to whom the announcement came as a surprise was one of Easton's sisters, who was recording a video of his speech. The camera slipped as she let out a whoop, part of a chorus of cheers that echoed through the Marriott Center. In the middle of the immense sports arena stood Easton, at a lectern bearing his university's initials. He smiled and paused, waiting for the applause to die down.  "Four years ago, it would have been impossible for me to imagine that I would come out to my entire college," he continued. "It is a phenomenal feeling. And it is a victory for me...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;uk.style.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixty years ago Dubai was little more than a village. Pearling and fishing propped up the economy and around 25,000 called it home. To put that into perspective, more people attend Sunderland’s football matches on a typical Saturday afternoon.</description>

      <title>POLL: Populist economic frustration threatens Trump's strongest reelection issue...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Populist-economic-frustration-threatens-Trump-s-13803043.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's strongest case for reelection remains the country's healthy economy, but the potency of that issue for him is complicated by a widespread belief that the economy mainly benefits people already in power, a Washington Post-ABC News poll finds.  The result previews a fresh wave of populism that could reshape yet another presidential campaign with about 18 months to go before voters decide whether to return Trump to the White House.  This sentiment runs the deepest among Democratic and independent registered voters, but also exists among a significant slice of Republicans. About 8 in 10 Democrats and more than 6 in 10 independents say the country's economic system gives an advantage to those already in power, while nearly a third of Republicans share that view.  The survey finds broad dissatisfaction with the country's economic and political systems. Overall, 60 percent of all voters say the country's economic system mainly benefits those in power, while 72 percent say the same for the nation's political structures.  The polling results in many ways echo the populist fervor that swept Trump to an unlikely victory over more than a dozen Republican challengers in the 2016 presidential primary campaign and an improbable win over Democrat Hillary Clinton that November.  But the findings show that, ahead of 2020, the sentiment is also animating Democrats.  The message of economic populism is carried most prominently in the Democratic presidential field by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who since his unsuccessful 2016 campaign has pushed the party leftward on a range of issues, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has proposed ideas such as a massive student loan forgiveness program and free tuition at public colleges paid for by taxing the...</description>

      <title>Pill that pings doctors shows promise, pitfalls...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/business/article/Pill-that-pings-doctors-shows-promise-pitfalls-13802445.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Food and Drug Administration approved in late 2017 a schizophrenia pill that sends a signal to a patient's doctor when ingested, it was seen not only as a major step forward for the disease but as a new frontier of internet-connected medicine.  Patients who have schizophrenia often stop taking their medicine, triggering psychotic episodes that can have severe consequences. So the pill, a 16-year-old medication combined with a tiny microchip, would help doctors intervene before a patient went dangerously off course.  Seventeen months later, few patients use the medication, known as Abilify MyCite. Doctors and insurance companies say it is a case in which real-world limitations, as well as costs, outweigh the innovations that the medical industry can produce.  In the case of schizophrenics, some doctors warn that Abilify MyCite could exacerbate the very delusions that the medication is designed to prevent.  "Patients who have a lot of paranoia might be uncomfortable with the idea of a medicine that is transmitting signals. The patient may be afraid to take it," said Richmond psychiatrist James Levenson. "The science of this one is kind of ahead of the data."  The debate over Abilify MyCite underscores a dilemma American health care will increasingly face as the medical industry and Silicon Valley try to promote innovation. For decades, medicine has been effectively delivered through a few simple mechanisms: a pill, a cream, a nose spray, a needle.  But in the hopes of improving outcomes further, the industry is turning to an array of new technologies against one of the biggest, and most human, challenges in treating disease: getting people to take their medicine in a consistent way.  Companies are producing apps for substance abuse treatment, diabetes management, and...</description>
