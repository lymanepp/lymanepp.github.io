But much like the subway grate stirred up her skirt, Monroe has created a whirlwind in just a few days in Stamford. Lorri Tamburro, a lifelong Stamford resident, was disturbed when she visited the statue with her husband and watched children climbing up Monroe's leg and looking up her skirt.</description>
