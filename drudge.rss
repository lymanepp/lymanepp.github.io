      <title>BIDEN WARNS TRUMP:  YOU WON'T DESTROY ME</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Biden-counterpunch-tries-to-turn-attention-to-14495561.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden on Saturday sought to take a more aggressive tone in combating President Donald Trump, a shift in strategy amid signs of worry among campaign donors and supporters that his message is getting lost in an onslaught from the White House.  Biden wrote an op-ed that was published Saturday night in The Washington Post, attempting to refocus attention on Trump's impropriety in asking Ukrainian leaders to investigate Biden's family.  "Enough is enough. Every day - every few hours, seemingly - more evidence is uncovered revealing that President Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president," Biden wrote. "He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal political interests instead of the national interest."  "He does not understand the immense responsibility demanded of all those who hold the office of the president of the United States," Biden continued. "He sees only the power - and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump."  Biden's move came amid growing anxiety among Biden's supporters that he is unprepared to handle the dual challenges of running a general-election campaign against Trump while simultaneously facing an intensifying Democratic primary contest.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has started to eclipse him in several polls, and Biden last week reported raising only $15.2 million during the last quarter - nearly $10 million less than Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Biden's supporters also have bridled that Democrats have been slow to rush to Biden's defense.  Biden's campaign on Saturday night distributed a memo to reporters from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield. The subject of the memo highlighted the twin challenges that one of the leading candidates has faced: "Biden...</description>

      <title>Heart attack raises questions about Sanders' campaign...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Heart-attack-raises-questions-about-Sanders-14495377.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders' admission late Friday that he had suffered a heart attack three days earlier invited new scrutiny of the presidential candidate's age, health and ability to keep up with the rigors of a national campaign.  Sanders released a video hours after he was discharged from a Las Vegas hospital, thanking well-wishers for their support and promising to return "soon" to the campaign trail.  "I'm feeling so much better," Sanders said, his arm draped around his wife, Jane.  But neither Sanders, I-Vt., nor his campaign offered details about how serious his condition was, leaving open the question of how soon he would re-emerge and whether voters would lose confidence in his ability to serve as president.  The episode also brought new attention to a Democratic field that is currently dominated by three septuagenarians: Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., 70 - each of whom would be the oldest president ever to take office.  "I think anybody's health is of concern when it comes to that high office," said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County, Iowa, Democratic Party, who supported Sanders in 2016 but is neutral so far this year. "You know, if the person was 40 and was having some issues, I'd have concerns about it too."  Sanders headed home Saturday to Burlington, Vermont, with no word on how long he would stay there. Jane Sanders said before his release that he would rest a "few days" but would take part in the Oct. 15 Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio.  The campaign's decision to wait three days to reveal that Sanders had suffered a heart attack conjured images of Hillary Clinton's collapse in 2016 at a memorial service for the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Clinton, at the time the Democratic presidential nominee, had been diagnosed with...</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Mounting-evidence-buttresses-the-facts-laid-out-14495008.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the revelation of an explosive whistleblower complaint that sparked an impeachment crisis for President Donald Trump, he and his Republican allies have coalesced around a central defense: The document was based on secondhand information, mere hearsay riddled with inaccuracies.  But over the past two weeks, documents, firsthand witness accounts and even statements by Trump himself have emerged that bolster the facts outlined in the extraordinary abuse-of-power complaint.  The descriptionof a July 25 phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine, which formed the heart of the complaint and was still secret at the time the claim was filed in mid-August, matches a rough transcript of the call that the White House released a day before the complaint was made public.  The whistleblower's assertion that records related to the phone call were transferred to a separate electronic system intended for highly classified material has since been confirmed by White House officials.  And the whistleblower's narrative of the events that led up to the call - including a shadow campaign undertaken by Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and the attempts of U.S. State Department officials to navigate his activities- have been largely confirmed by the text messages of three diplomats released Friday, as well as Giuliani himself in media interviews.  Independent evidence now supports the central elements laid out in the seven-page document. Even if they disregarded the complaint, legal experts said lawmakers have obtained dramatic testimony and documents that provide ammunition for the whistleblower's core assertion: that the president of the United States used "the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election."  "Everything we've found to date validates the information. . . ....</description>
