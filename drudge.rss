      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/864643/biden-shrugs-heathcare-costs-when-sanders-brings-canada-america</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary debates offer an important opportunity to shake out the differences between candidates with similar ideologies, a service that is all the more necessary when there are twenty of them running. The beginning of Thursday night's Democratic debate involved plenty of that sort of elbow-throwing as the candidates tried to make space for their own plans to address the question of health care in America, and things got particularly spicy between two of the front runners: former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden had been on the defense against Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) over his support of ObamaCare, which the senators had argued left too many people uninsured. "I think â€” I know that [Warren] says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack," Biden had said early in the night. "I think the ObamaCare worked." But Sanders fiercely pushed back on that statement. "Now let's be clear, Joe," Sanders said. "We are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on Earth." "This is America," said Biden. "Yeah, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries," Sanders shot back. "And [other countries] guarantee health care to all people ... What people want is cost-effective health care." Watch the prickly exchange below. Jeva Lange  Bernie Sanders: "We are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth."Joe Biden: "This is America.""Yeah, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries." https://t.co/INdRXlIwFs #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/hrYzxLgXiC â€” ABC News (@ABC) September 13, 2019</description>

      <title>New iPhone creep out? Tiny holes scare...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Does-the-new-iPhone-creep-you-out-Scientists-14433714.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Apple debuted its newest iPhones on Tuesday, a striking new feature took center stage: a three-lens setup that puts a near-professional camera in the hands of anyone who can afford the $999 to $1099 devices. Three lenses are a lot better than two - unless they send you reeling in disgust.  That's the unexpected reaction thousands of Apple fans shared on social media as images spread of the back of the new phone, where the trio of lenses are crowded into a small square near the top left corner.  "The new iPhone is creeping me ... out with the 3 little cameras," one Twitter user wrote.  The backlash comes from people who say they suffer from an obscure and perplexing condition called "trypophobia" - a fear of clusters of small holes like those found in shoe treads, honeycombs and lotus seed pods. Essex University Professor Geoff Cole, a self-diagnosed trypophobe and researcher in the United Kingdom who studies the condition calls it "the most common phobia you have never heard of."  The phobia isn't recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which psychologists and psychiatrists use to diagnose patients. But self-described sufferers and some researchers claim the images can evoke a strong emotional response and induce itching, goose bumps, and even nausea and vomiting.  Trypophobia was only named in 2005 after the word began appearing on Reddit and in other online forums, like in a post by an Irish woman named Louise who belonged to an online community of self-described "weirdoes who have an irrational fear of HOLES."  Over the next decade, though, thousands of people have reported suffering from trypophobia. Support groups have popped up on social media. In 2016, Kendall Jenner raised the condition's profile when she wrote a blog post saying...</description>
