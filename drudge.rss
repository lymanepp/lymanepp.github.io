      <title>SINGER DRAKE BECOMES STAR OF NBA FINALS...</title>
      <link>https://www.mediaite.com/sports/toronto-raptors-superfan-drake-spent-his-entire-night-trolling-the-golden-state-warriors/</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mediaite.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prior to Thursday night's NBA Finals Game 1 between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors, league commissioner Adam Silver personally addressed talks with Drake about his conduct on the sideline. "The league office had conversations directly with Drake and his manager, and I think we ended up in a good place," Silver said, according to ESPN. He might have to reevaluate. From before the opening tip until after the final horn sounded, Drake spent his entire night trolling the Warriors like crazy. The hip-hop star and Toronto Raptors superfan showed up to Thursday night's contest -- Toronto's first-ever appearance in the NBA Finals -- wearing a jersey of former Raptors player Dell Curry. Of course, Dell Curry is the father of Golden State star Stephen Curry. Then, at one point in the contest, Curry the younger and Drake exchanged words -- with their faces just millimeters apart. Drake noticed some lint on Curry's head, and proceeded to pick it off. After the game, he posted</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Zuckerberg's personal security chief has been placed on administrative leave amid allegations that he made racist and homophobic remarks about people including the Facebook founder's wife.  Liam Booth allegedly made the remarks about Zuckerberg's wife, Priscilla Chan, and some of the employees at their household, Business Insider reported earlier, citing legal letters from the former household staff. A spokesman for the Zuckerberg and Chan family office said Booth has been placed on leave while an outside law firm investigates. It didn't confirm the precise nature of the allegations published by Business Insider.  "The family office takes complaints of workplace misconduct very seriously," the spokesman told Bloomberg News in an email. "The allegations against Liam Booth were brought to the office's attention for the first time by the Bloom Firm after both former employees had left employment by the family office and engaged legal counsel."  Lisa Bloom of the Bloom Firm confirmed by email that she represents "the two individuals who have raised claims." She declined to identify the people involved or share details on the allegations.  Booth is a former Secret Service officer, according to his LinkedIn profile. He didn't immediately reply to a message outside of U.S. business hours.  Facebook's costs for Zuckerberg's personal protection amounted to $9.96 million in 2018, regulatory filings show. The chief executive officer also gets an additional annual $10 million allowance to cover security expenses for himself and his family.</description>

      <title>Avg millennial net worth $8,000 -- far less than previous generations...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/The-average-millennial-has-an-average-net-worth-13909188.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Millennials are doing far worse financially than generations before them, with student loans, rising rents and higher health care costs pushing the average net worth below $8,000, a new study shows.  The net worth of Americans aged 18 to 35 has dropped 34 percent since 1996, according to research released Thursday by Deloitte, the accounting and professional services giant. This demographic is paying more for education and such basics as food and transportation while incomes have largely flatlined.  "The vast majority of consumers are under tremendous financial pressure," said Kasey Lobaugh, Deloitte's chief retail innovation officer and lead author of the study. "That is particularly true for low-income Americans and millennials."  The growing gap between the nation's wealthiest residents and everybody else, he said, is affecting the way consumers spend.  Education expenses have climbed 65 percent in the past decade. Food costs have jumped 26 percent, health care is up 21 percent, housing jumped 16 percent and transportation rose 11 percent. And there are now expenses that most consumers didn't have to account for 20 years ago, including smartphones and data plans.  Today's 20- and 30-somethings spend about 17 percent of their incomes on education, health care and rent, compared with 12 percent a decade ago, the study found. Discretionary spending, which includes dining out, alcohol and furniture, has remained largely flat, at about 11 percent of total income.  "Only 20 percent of consumers were meaningfully better off in 2017 than they were in 2007, with precious little income left to spend on discretionary retail," the study found.  The findings, researchers say, "debunk many conventional wisdoms about the new-age consumer." Millennials, they contend, are putting off...</description>
