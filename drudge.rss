      <title>In countries keeping virus at bay, experts watch US cases with alarm...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/In-countries-keeping-the-coronavirus-at-bay-15351626.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As coronavirus cases surge in states across the South and West of the United States, health experts in countries with falling case numbers are watching with a growing sense of alarm and disbelief, with many wondering why virus-stricken U.S. states continue to reopen and why the advice of scientists is often ignored.  "It really does feel like the U.S. has given up," said Siouxsie Wiles, an infectious-diseases specialist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand - a country that has confirmed only three new cases over the last three weeks and where citizens have now largely returned to their pre-coronavirus routines.  "I can't imagine what it must be like having to go to work knowing it's unsafe," Wiles said of the U.S.-wide economic reopening. "It's hard to see how this ends. There are just going to be more and more people infected, and more and more deaths. It's heartbreaking."  China's actions over the past week stand in stark contrast to those of the United States. In the wake of a new cluster of more than 150 new cases that emerged in Beijing, authorities sealed off neighborhoods, launched a mass testing campaign and imposed travel restrictions.  Meanwhile, President Donald Trump maintains that the United States will not shut down a second time, although a surge in cases has convinced governors in some states, including Arizona, to walk back their opposition to mandatory face coverings in public.  Commentators and experts in Europe, where cases have continued to decline, voiced concerns over the state of the U.S. response. A headline on the website of Germany's public broadcaster read: "Has the U.S. given up its fight against coronavirus?" Switzerland's conservative Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper concluded, "U.S. increasingly accepts rising covid-19 numbers."  "The only thing one can say with certainty: There's...</description>

      <title>Tulsa imposes curfew to prevent violence...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Tulsa-imposes-curfew-ahead-of-Trump-rally-to-15351712.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TULSA - As thousands of fans and protesters poured into this city in advance of President Donald Trump's first campaign rally in months, authorities imposed a curfew as fears of potential violence mingled with anxiety about a spike in new cases of coronavirus.  Metal barricades went up around downtown and police cars began blocking off streets after Tulsa announced a last-minute curfew for the downtown area Thursday night that will continue Friday and Saturday.  Officials cleared the area around the BOK Center where Trump fans had been camping for days in the hopes of being among the first inside the Saturday night rally that is expected to draw far more than the 19,000-seat arena can hold.  The move came after Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum declared a "civil emergency," saying law enforcement informed him that "individuals from organized groups who have been involved in destructive and violent behavior in other states are planning to travel to the City of Tulsa for purposes of causing unrest in and around the rally," according to his executive order.  Meanwhile, the Oklahoma Supreme Court is expected to rule Friday on a lawsuit filed by local citizens against the venue demanding that the arena adhere to social distancing guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or be canceled.  Trump joined the fray, tweeting Friday that "any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma, please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!"  The president's decision to hold his first campaign style rally since the pandemic began in Tulsa on Juneteenth weekend has angered many across the country and in Tulsa, and comes as the country is in the midst of a historic reckoning on race after the death of George...</description>

      <title>TWITTER CENSORS AGAIN...</title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Twitter-labels-Trump-video-tweet-as-manipulated-15351108.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter on Thursday evening took the rare step of appending a warning label to one of President Donald Trump's tweets after the company determined it violated its policies on manipulated media.  The president tweeted a doctored version of a popular video that went viral in 2019, which showed a black and a white toddler hugging. In the version Trump shared, the video has been edited with ominous music and a fake CNN headline that says, "Terrified toddler runs from racist baby."  "Racist baby probably a Trump voter," the headline then says in a subsequent screen.  The video then cuts to the original clip of the children hugging, and then cuts to the message "America is not the problem. Fake news is."  The video received at least 3.8 million views, and more than 75,000 retweets.  "This tweet has been labeled per our synthetic and manipulated media policy to give people more context," Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said.  This is only the third time that the company has announced that it would take action against one of the president's tweets. Twitter has previously appended labels to a pair of Trump's tweets that made misleading claims about mail-in ballots, as well as another post that said "when the looting starts, the shooting starts" for violating its terms on violence.  Trump lashed out at Twitter after the company's initial decision to label his tweets regarding the mail-in ballots, signing an executive order that week that sought to punish social media companies by calling on federal regulators to reexamine a key legal shield that gives tech companies broad immunity for the posts and photos people share on their services.  Twitter's decision to label the tweets is the culmination of a series of quiet and incremental processes intended to dismantle a long-standing...</description>

      <title>'Whole country will be Minneapolis' if Dems win...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trump-warns-that-under-Democrats-whole-country-15351097.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump painted a dire image of America if he loses his reelection, warning in an interview with his son that the economy would collapse, law enforcement would disappear and the "whole country will be Minneapolis."  His threat that without him the country would look like the Midwestern city was alluding to the looting and riots that beset the city for several nights following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in police custody. He did not mention that during the day there were largely peaceful demonstrations in the city (or that there's an entire meme about how nice Minnesotans are).  "I feel that if the Democrats get in, we are literally going to end up in a recession-slash-depression the likes of which you've never seen," Trump said. "There will be tremendous negative growth, tremendous bedlam all over the place, there won't be law and order. You'll have a Seattle, you'll have a Minneapolis like you've never seen before. The whole country will be Minneapolis."  Trump's dystopian prediction came during a 20-minute interview with Donald Trump Jr. on his online show "Triggered" that ranged in topics from which Trump child is his favorite ("All the same, 100 percent") to "Saturday Night Live" ("I don't find it funny") to Don Jr.'s quarantine beard ("I don't like it on you").  Trump slammed Democratic-run cities, specifically deriding the creation of an autonomous, police-free zone in a Seattle neighborhood and taking credit for easing the unrest in Minneapolis.  "The Democrat-run cities are the ones having the trouble," he said. "You look at Seattle, when you go to Minnesota and you take a look at what's taken place there, it's incredible. They tried to take over a great city, Minneapolis, and they had taken it over before I said, 'you have to send in the National Guard'."  Gov. Tim Walz, a...</description>
