        "description": "Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, responsible for reporting on President Biden, the fifth president he has covered. He previously wrote about Presidents Donald J. Trump and Barack Obama for The Times and Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush for The Washington Post. Mr. Baker joined The Times in 2008 after 20 years at The Post and has reported on elections, inaugurations, economic crises, foreign policy, natural disasters, legislative battles and Supreme Court nominations. He co-authored the Post&#8217;s original story breaking the Ken Starr investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and served as the paper&#8217;s lead writer on the impeachment of Mr. Clinton. He covered the ups and downs of the Bush and Obama presidencies, including the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. And he chronicled the tumultuous Trump administration through the coronavirus pandemic, the storming of the Capitol and both impeachments. In between stints at the White House, Mr. Baker and his wife, Susan Glasser, spent four years as Moscow bureau chiefs for The Post, chronicling the rise of Vladimir Putin, the rollback of Russian democracy, the second Chechen war and various terrorist attacks. Mr. Baker also covered the early months of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was the first American newspaper journalist to report from rebel-held northern Afghanistan after Sept. 11, 2001, and he spent the next eight months covering the overthrow of the Taliban and the emergence of a new government. He later traveled the Middle East for six months, reporting from inside Saddam Hussein's Iraq and around the region before embedding with the United States Marines as they drove toward Baghdad. At The Times, he served briefly as Jerusalem bureau chief. Mr. Baker is the author of six books, most recently the bestselling \"The Man Who Ran Washington: The Life and Times of James A. Baker II&#8221; (Doubleday, 2020), written with Ms. Glasser and named one of the books of the year by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Financial Times, Fortune and Bloomberg. He also wrote &#8220;Obama: The Call of History&#8221; (New York Times/Callaway, 2017), a finalist for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work; &#8220;Days of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House&#8221; (Doubleday, 2013), which was named one of the five Best Non-Fiction Books of 2013 by The New York Times; &#8220;The Breach: Inside the Impeachment and Trial of William Jefferson Clinton&#8221; (Scribner, 2000), a New York Times bestseller; \"Impeachment: An American History\" (Modern Library, 2018) with Jon Meacham, Timothy Naftali and Jeffrey A. Engel; and, with Ms. Glasser, &#8220;Kremlin Rising: Vladimir Putin&#8217;s Russia and the End of Revolution&#8221; (Scribner, 2005), named one of the Best Books of 2005 by The Washington Post. Mr. Baker has won all three major awards devoted to White House reporting: the Gerald R. Ford Prize for Distinguished Coverage of the Presidency (twice), the Aldo Beckman Memorial Award (twice) and the Merriman Smith Memorial Award. Mr. Baker is also a political analyst for MSNBC and a regular panelist on PBS&#8217;s &#8220;Washington Week.&#8221; A native of the Washington area, Mr. Baker attended Oberlin College and worked for The Washington Times for two years before joining The Post in 1988 as a Virginia reporter. Ms. Glasser is now a staff writer for The New Yorker and the two live in Washington with their son Theodore."
