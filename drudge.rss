      <title>At Iowa dinner, Warren and Mayor Pete take aim at one another...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/At-Iowa-s-Democratic-dinner-Warren-and-Buttigieg-14804568.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DES MOINES, Iowa - The Iowa Democratic Party's fall fundraising dinner has often been the tone-setter for the stretch run ahead of the state's first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses. If the speeches and demonstrations here Friday night were any indication, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg now see themselves on a collision course.  Other candidates continue to be factors, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the most obvious. People also talk about the possibility that someone well down in the polls could suddenly emerge. Right now, however, the focus increasingly is on Warren and Buttigieg.  Warren is widely regarded as the candidate to beat in Iowa. Her organization is currently judged as the best in the field, and her disciplined campaign style has helped to provide the edge she currently enjoys.  One prominent Democrat closely monitoring the campaign, who asked not to be identified to offer a candid assessment, said Warren has "the best field organization seen in the state since Obama in 2008." Another longtime Democratic Party activist, who talks with many campaigns and also did not want to be identified, said, "She's killing it here in Iowa."  Buttigieg started slowly: His campaign initially consisted of four people, and his organization was late to get moving. Despite successes, the candidacy of the 37-year-old mayor of the city of 100,000 continues to face skepticism about its long-term durability, particularly over his ability to attract support from African Americans.  But in Iowa, he has been rising rapidly of late. His team is upbeat, and Buttigieg's sense of confidence was on display in an interview filmed late in the week with journalist John Heilemann of Showtime's "The Circus," the full contents of which will be on the air Sunday...</description>

      <title>Yang campaign has gone 'mainstream'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/876117/andrew-yangs-campaign-gone-mainstream</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;While some Democratic presidential candidates are cutting back on their campaigns, entrepreneur Andrew Yang is going all in, Politico reports. Yang, who as recently as April, had fewer than 20 staff members on his campaign's payroll, now has 73 people running the show. "It's been like a startup but this startup has gone mainstream, about to go public, if you want to keep using the analogy," said Zach Graumann, Yang's campaign manager. "And frankly and I tell the team, 'we're just getting started.'" There's some big names now involved with the campaign, as well, lending more credence to Graumann's words. Devine, Mulvey, and Longabaugh â€” a media consulting firm which worked for the 2016 campaign for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but opted to not to join forces again for 2020 over "differences in a creative vision" â€” has shifted its services to the Yang campaign because he's "offering the most progressive ideas" among the Democratic candidates. They also don't think he's a flash in the pan. "We wouldn't have signed on with somebody we didn't think was a serious candidate," Mark Longabaugh said. "Yang has a good deal of momentum and there's a great deal of grassroots enthusiasm for his candidacy and that's what's driven it this far." Yang still faces numerous hurdles to really get back in the running, but the campaign surely think it's possible. Read more at Politico. Tim O'Donnell</description>

      <title>Growing number of Republican senators consider acknowledging quid pro quo...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/GOP-senators-may-accept-there-was-Ukraine-quid-14803461.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A growing number of Senate Republicans are ready to acknowledge that President Donald Trump used U.S. military aid as leverage to force Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his family as the president repeatedly denies a quid pro quo.  In this shift in strategy to defend Trump, these Republicans are insisting that the president's action was not illegal and does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense as the Democratic-led House moves forward with the open phase of its probe.  But the shift among Senate Republicans could complicate the message coming from Trump as he furiously fights the claim that he had withheld U.S. aid from Ukraine to pressure it to dig up dirt on a political rival, even as an increasing number of Republicans wonder how long they can continue to argue that no quid pro quo was at play in the matter.  The pivot was the main topic during a private Senate GOP lunch on Wednesday, according to multiple people familiar with the session who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the meeting. Sen. John Neely Kennedy, R-La., argued that there may have been a quid pro quo but said that the U.S. government often attaches conditions to foreign aid and that nothing was amiss in Trump's doing so in the case of aid to Ukraine, these individuals said.  Inside the lunch, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who ran against Trump in 2016, said a quid pro quo is not illegal unless there is "corrupt intent" and echoed Kennedy's argument that such conditions are a tool of foreign policy.  "To me, this entire issue is gonna come down to, why did the president ask for an investigation," Kennedy, who worked as a lawyer, said in an interview. "To me, it all turns on intent, motive. ... Did the president have a culpable state of mind? . . . Based on the evidence that I see, that I've been...</description>
