      <title>With no end to pandemic in sight, coronavirus fatigue grips nation...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/With-no-end-to-the-pandemic-in-sight-coronavirus-15475104.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabe Rice began sheltering in his suburban Phoenix home with his wife and three youngest children in March. They worked remotely, learned remotely and put social events on hold to hunker down alongside much of the country.  It was challenging and frustrating, but, Rice initially assumed, temporary. It seemed like a plausible plan to help the nation get the pandemic under control within a couple of months.  But Arizona's economic reopening in May, urged by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, was soon followed by a spike in coronavirus infections in June, which became a terrible surge in hospitalizations and deaths by July.  Then came August, and the devastating realization for many Americans that the pandemic, which has killed at least 159,000 people across the country and sickened more than five million, is far from over.  "It's difficult when you think you have a light at the other end of the tunnel to look forward to, and then all of a sudden you realize it's a train," said Rice, 44, a program coordinator at Arizona State University.  An exhausted, exasperated nation is suffering from the effects of a pandemic that has upended society on a scale and duration without parallel in living memory.  The Rice family and millions of other Americans are wrestling with difficult questions about how to juggle school, pay their bills and look after their mental and physical health.  Parents lie awake, their minds racing with thoughts of how to balance work with their newfound role as home-schoolers. Frontline health workers are bone tired, their nerves frayed by endless shifts and constant encounters with the virus and its victims. Senior citizens have grown weary of isolation. Unemployed workers fret over jobs lost, benefits that are running out, rent payments that are overdue. Minority...</description>

      <title>Disinformation for profit: How Florida 'dealmaker' turns conservative outrage into cash...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Disinformation-for-profit-How-a-Florida-15474775.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reality curated by "The Bearded Patriot" and "The Wolf of Washington" is dismal.  The websites tell of nonstop riots and "crazed leftists." They warn of online censorship and the wiles of an "anarchist billionaire," a reference to George Soros, the liberal investor and Holocaust survivor.  The material is tailor-made to inflame right-wing passions. But its underlying purpose is to collect email addresses and other personal information from impassioned readers, whose inboxes then fill up with narrowly targeted ads. The effect is to monetize the anger stoked by misleading political content - for as much as $2,500 per list of contacts.  An investigation by Alethea Group, an organization combating disinformation that draws its name from the Greek word for "truth," has linked the operation to Mark S. Evans Jr., a self-proclaimed "online multimillionaire" who affixes "DM," for "dealmaker," to his name. The network of 178 sites, at least half of which are politically themed and share visual as well as technical features, is designed to harvest email addresses, which are then sold to commercial brands, according to Alethea Group's analysis, and possibly also to political campaigns.  The findings, which were provided to The Washington Post, illuminate the financial motives behind the spread of hyperpartisan, low-quality news. And they reveal how merchants of misinformation are exploiting techniques of data collection to more efficiently capitalize on polarization and falsehoods and more effectively target specific communities.  "This is for-profit fearmongering enhanced by aggressive data collection," said Cindy Otis, Alethea Group's vice president of analysis. The digital marketing apparatus made possible by the sites, including lucrative data profiles of their visitors, "comes with the capability to support political...</description>

      <title>Rice conspicuously left off DNC speakers list...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/930546/susan-rice-conspicuously-left-dnc-speakers-list-ahead-bidens-veep-announcement</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Democrats announced the lineup of speakers at next week's Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, and all the usual suspects are included â€” former President Barack Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and several ex-presidential candidates, like Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). But there's one name missing from the list that has pundits in a tizzy: Susan Rice, the Obama-era diplomat who is reportedly a top pick for vice president. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden hasn't announced his runningmate yet, and as he continues to punt the announcement, speculation has been escalating. He's already committed to selecting a woman, and is under some pressure to select a Black woman. But while another top contender, Harris, is listed as a speaker at the DNC, Rice is nowhere to be seen, despite her prominence and renewed spotlight as a VP possibility. Could she be the unnamed 'Vice Presidential Nominee' slotted to speak on Wednesday? Based on the official line up of the DNC convention, can we safely say @AmbassadorRice is the VP pick? pic.twitter.com/W2QL2GoxXR â€” Fernand R. Amandi (@AmandiOnAir) August 11, 2020 It's far from hard evidence, but with analysts hungry for an update in the veepstakes, it's hard to ignore. The DNC is set to begin on Monday, and will largely consist of pre-recorded videos and virtual appearances, to avoid the originally-planned gathering in Milwaukee. Delegates have been asked to stay home, though Biden is still expected to accept the nomination on stage in Wisconsin. Summer Meza</description>

      <title>Mexicans eschew hospitals, fearing doctors deliberately infecting...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/930357/mexicos-coronavirus-outbreak-worsened-by-widespread-distrust-hospitals</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The U.S., by a wide margin, leads the globe in COVID-19 cases. But its neighbor to the south has its own alarming spike, making it the third worst outbreak in the world. Mexico has had 52,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths, The New York Times reported Monday. A widespread distrust of hospitals has made the pandemic even deadlier, as Mexicans are reportedly frequently refusing to seek treatment until their COVID-19 symptoms have worsened past the point of possible recovery, or not at all. Additionally, the tendency to avoid hospitals has made it difficult to confirm the true number of coronavirus deaths â€” those who die at home often aren't tested, so their deaths aren't counted as part of the official death toll. Mexico's government says there were 71,000 excess deaths this spring, deaths that aren't officially COVID-19-related but likely point to an even deadlier outbreak. Last month, nearly 70 percent of Mexicans said they would feel unsafe taking their loved ones to a hospital for coronavirus treatment, writes the Times. The fear, of course, isn't unfounded. Almost 40 percent of those hospitalized with COVID-19 end up dying, data shows, compared to less than 25 percent in New York City at the peak of the outbreak. Deaths in hospitals also happen quicker in Mexico, though doctors say that's partly because patients wait so long before arriving for treatment. The vicious cycle has many fearing that medical workers are even deliberately infecting patients or allowing them to die, though no evidence suggests that's the case. Read more at The New York Times.
