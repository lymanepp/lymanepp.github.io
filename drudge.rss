      <title>POLL:  Bloomberg widely unpopular following campaign launch...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Michael-Bloomberg-is-widely-unpopular-following-14895801.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Electability is a central pillar of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's newly launched presidential campaign, but a poll released Tuesday finds he is deeply unpopular with voters nationwide.  A Monmouth University poll found about twice as many registered voters rated Bloomberg negatively as positively -- 54% unfavorable, 26% favorable. That margin was significantly worse than for five other Democratic candidates, as well as for President Trump. That same measure hampered Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016.  Bloomberg garnered 5% support nationally for the Democratic nomination, narrowly higher than some other recent polls.He was in fifth place behind former vice president Joe Biden (26%) and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (21%) and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (17%). Bloomberg's support is within the margin of error of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8%, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 4%, businessman Andrew Yang at 3% and Sen. Corey Booker of New Jersey at 2%.  Yet the negative favorability ratings are a sign Bloomberg may struggle to grow his support among both among Democrats the broader electorate. Since its launch last month, his campaign has spent more money on ads than all the top-polling Democrats combined and is simultaneously building out ground operations in 27 states.  "Bloomberg said he got into this race because he wants to defeat Trump, but his campaign kicks off with even lower ratings than the incumbent," said Monmouth polling director Patrick Murray. "That is not the most auspicious start, but views of Bloomberg are not as deeply held as they are for Trump, so he has room to shift those opinions,"  The Monmouth poll found leading Democratic candidates also have net negative images but by smaller margins than Bloomberg. Biden was rated favorably by 43% of all registered...</description>

      <title>Memo in 1990s pollution case shows Warren in action as corporate consultant...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Memo-in-1990s-pollution-case-shows-Elizabeth-14894375.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The memo from then-Professor Elizabeth Warren was written on Harvard University law school letterhead, a symbol of gravitas for a scholar renowned as a champion for consumers victimized by predatory banks and other big businesses.  But on this occasion, Warren was not arguing on behalf of vulnerable families, nor was she offering the sort of stinging rebuke of corporate greed that would later define her political career. Rather, Warren was representing a large development company that was trying to avoid having to clean up a toxic waste site.  The memo, which Warren wrote in 1996, used legalistic and often dense language to argue that businesses faced the "risk of the unknown" from a growing threat of lawsuits, and that defended the company's right to "maximize its returns to its unpaid creditors and to survive as an employer."  "Environmental claims, product liability claims, and mass tort claims, for which we have currently only seen the tip of the iceberg, are multiplying against American businesses," wrote Warren, who, according to her campaign, was arguing that a different company should bear the cleanup costs.  The eight-page memo, which has not previously been reported, offers a rare glimpse of Warren in action during her past work as a corporate consultant - one whose arguments were at times out of step with the liberal presidential campaign she is running today.  Warren's compensation in the 1996 case was included in a summary released by her campaign late Sunday night showing that she had been paid about $2 million as a legal consultant during her time as a professor, most of it between 1995 and 2009.  But Warren, who has released 11 years of tax returns, has not disclosed her tax records from most of that time period. And her campaign has provided few details about her private legal business beyond short...</description>

      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/In-opening-Trump-campaign-investigation-FBI-felt-14894307.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The FBI had barely closed a politically volcanic investigation into Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when it got a troubling tip about her rival's presidential campaign.  On July 28, 2016, the bureau received information from an Australian diplomat, who said a Donald Trump campaign aide had "suggested the Trump team had received some kind of suggestion from Russia" that Moscow could anonymously release damaging information about Clinton, according to the long-awaited Justice Department inspector general's report released Monday.  The tip, vague as it was, shook senior FBI officials, who were already investigating suspected Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, including the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee. Three days later, the FBI took the momentous decision to open a counterintelligence investigation of a presidential campaign, as the election season entered the home stretch.  Almost ever since, the origin of that investigation has been a lens through which Trump's most ardent supporters and critics see his entire presidency. To the former camp, it is the original sin of a Deep State determined to prevent Trump's election on the basis of slim, if not outright fabricated evidence. To Trump's opponents, the investigation was the only possible response to the threat of a foreign adversary compromising the Republican presidential nominee's campaign.  The 434-page report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz will not settle the feud. It finds that the FBI's investigation, dubbed Crossfire Hurricane, was sufficiently predicated and largely confirms previous findings about the origins of the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller.  But it also questions officials' investigative decisions, notably about how they decided to secretly monitor the...</description>
