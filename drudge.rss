      <title>New taxes coming...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Governments-eye-new-taxes-on-cigarettes-homes-15368171.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cash-starved cities and states across the country are starting to weigh whether to raise taxes on homes, cigarettes, local businesses and global tech giants, hoping to rake in new revenue that might help them close the massive budget shortfalls created by the coronavirus pandemic.  The increases that have been proposed - and in some cases adopted - reflect the growing desperation on the part of government leaders nationwide. Many have found that recent spending cuts, furloughs and layoffs haven't been enough to shore up their sagging finances, forcing them to consider more politically noxious and economically risky moves in the middle of an economic crisis.  "No politician wants to lead with raising taxes," said Mark Mazur, the director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. "When they get there, it's because they've run out of other options."  Philadelphia increased fees on parking and raised wage taxes on workers who reside outside the city. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, D, said this month she couldn't rule out a property tax increase to cover her city's $700 million budget shortfall. From New York to Seattle, other states and municipalities have considered a wide array of prospective rate hikes in response major drops in once-reliable sources of income - and months of failed attempts to get Congress to authorize more federal aid.  Nashville leaders even took the eye-popping step in June to increase property taxes by about 34 percent, a move meant to help pay down rising public education costs - and one that quickly sparked a public outcry.  The city's rates long had been historically low, according to Bob Mendes, an at-large member of the Nashville Metro Council who helped craft the budget blueprint. An increase helped pave the way for the city to close an anticipated $216 million financial hole in the 2021 fiscal...</description>

      <title>How Arizona lost control of the epidemic...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/How-Arizona-lost-control-of-the-epidemic-15367484.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHOENIX - A drive-up testing site equipped for several hundred people in West Phoenix was swarmed on Saturday by about 1,000 people, leaving some baking in their cars for hours.  A nearby testing station has already reached capacity for this weekend, appointments vanishing within minutes. Hospitals are filling up. Restaurants are again shutting down, more than a month after Arizona reopened its economy under the mantra "Return Stronger."  Arizona has emerged as an epicenter of the early summer's coronavirus crisis as the outbreak has metastasized, flaring across new parts of the country and, notably, infecting more young people.  Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, is recording as many as 2,000 cases a day, "eclipsing the New York City boroughs even on their worst days," warned a Wednesday brief by disease trackers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, which observed, "Arizona has lost control of the epidemic."  But physicians, public health experts, advocates and local officials say the crisis was predictable in Arizona, where local ordinances requiring masks were verboten until Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, reversed course last week. State leaders did not take the necessary precautions or model safe behavior, these observers maintain, even in the face of compelling evidence and repeated pleas from authoritative voices.  "We have failed on so many levels," said Dana Marie Kennedy, the Arizona director of AARP, who said her organization has yet to receive a response to four letters outlining concerns to the governor. She is working on a fifth.  Neither the governor's office nor the state health department responded to requests for comment.  At critical junctures, blunders by top officials undermined faith in the data purportedly driving decision-making, according to...</description>
