      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trump-lashes-out-at-George-Conway-who-has-been-13699482.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Tuesday ratcheted up a remarkable public spat with the husband of one of his top advisers, attacking Kellyanne Conway's husband as a "total loser" on Twitter in response to the lawyer's persistent questions about his mental health and competency.  "A total loser!" Trump wrote in the tweet targeting Conway's husband, a prominent conservative attorney. The president's tweet also included a dubious assertion from Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, that the president "doesn't even know" his senior adviser's husband.  But George Conway said in an interview Tuesday that he has had a number of notable interactions with Trump over the past decade, including legal representation and sensitive legal matters since Trump became president. He described the president as "mendacious" and "incompetent" and predicted he would not win reelection.  Conway also suggested his own tweets questioning the president's mental health were aimed in part at avoiding conflicts with his wife.  "It's so maddening to watch," said Conway, a longtime Washington attorney who is well-known in conservative circles. "The mendacity, the incompetence, it's just maddening to watch. The tweeting is just the way to get it out of the way, so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day. That's basically it. Frankly, it's so I don't end up screaming at her about it."  Conway has been a persistent critic of Trump's policies and actions, frequently going on Twitter to question whether the president is operating within the Constitution and other accepted boundaries. But the criticism recently has become more personal, and he has often attacked Trump just after his wife defends the president on television.  Conway's tweets on Monday included images from the...</description>
