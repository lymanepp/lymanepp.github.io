      <title>Georgia cover-up: Key info kept from public...</title>
      <link>https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-keeps-key-virus-information-from-public/DHZGBAGKJRFLVDCGCWGJ2NGCLE/</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ajc.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Georgia residents looking to gauge the stateâ€™s response to key challenges of the coronavirus pandemic arenâ€™t getting the information they need from a key state agency. The Georgia Emergency Management Agency, responsible for buying and distributing protective equipment and other supplies to facilities ranging from nursing homes to first responders, has withheld hundreds of pages of documents requested by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Among other things, those documents show the details of deliveries of personal protective equipment, projections of the need for such equipment, comparisons of deaths in Georgia counties and other counties across the country and details of agreements with local hospitals. Attorneys who specialize in open government say GEMA appears to be on shaky legal ground in withholding the documents. And by keeping the public in the dark, they say itâ€™s harder to hold the government accountable for its decisions â€“ and easier for the government to spin a positive story about its pandemic response.</description>

      <title>Discontent with McCarthy rises as GOP considers post-Trump world...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Discontent-with-McCarthy-rises-as-GOP-considers-a-15483529.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Discontent with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is on the rise in the House, as Republicans increasingly fearful of a loss by President Donald Trump on Election Day gear up for an intraparty war over the future of the GOP.  A cluster of GOP lawmakers is starting to privately question whether the California Republican is putting loyalty to the president over the good of the conference. And there is a small group of members discussing whether someone should challenge him for minority leader if Trump is defeated Nov. 3.  The matter bubbled to the surface this week with the primary election of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a fringe House candidate in Georgia who espouses the QAnon conspiracy theory and has made numerous racist comments. Multiple Republicans implored McCarthy to help defeat her by supporting her primary opponent. But McCarthy refused, phoning the candidate in an apparent peace accord before the primary, while Trump embraced her on Twitter this week as a "future Republican Star."  However, the frustration with McCarthy had already been brewing for weeks as Trump's polling has sagged behind presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. According to interviews with more than 10 House Republicans - all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to be frank - some GOP lawmakers are worried that McCarthy has tied the conference too much to Trump, refusing to stand up to the president or act as a buffer to distinguish the conference from him.  Others are also furious that he didn't shield them from a recent Trump campaign demand that House members donate to the president's reelection effort.  "There's no doubt that McCarthy is a Trump loyalist, through and through," said Doug Heye, a former House GOP leadership staffer who has known McCarthy personally for decades. "I think the challenge for everyone in the...</description>

      <title>BUNKER:  Secret Service sought tactical aircraft to protect White House amid Floyd demonstrations... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Secret-Service-sought-tactical-aircraft-to-15482671.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Secret Service sought to bolster its protection of the White House with surveillance aircraft and a Blackhawk helicopter carrying a "fast rope" commando team after crowds protesting the police killing of George Floyd knocked down temporary barricades and one man got onto the complex grounds in late May, according to newly obtained government correspondence.  That breach - combined with the throngs of protesters that converged outside the White House the night of May 29 - prompted agents to rush President Donald Trump to a reinforced bunker and spurred a deeper concern about the White House's vulnerability.  In a letter a week later, the Secret Service asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide aircraft that could be used in a rapid-response helicopter operation, the records show.  Customs and Border Protection ultimately provided the agency with live information from a surveillance plane, but the Secret Service determined that the helicopter was not necessary, according to administration officials familiar with the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.  Washington is the latest example of cities where CBP deployed surveillance aircraft in the skies in recent months to monitor demonstrations. In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed, a Predator drone was dispatched May 29. The agency's role has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and others who say such tactics infringe on privacy and free-speech rights.  In a June 5 letter, a top Secret Service official asked CBP for use of a Blackhawk helicopter equipped with special "fast ropes." The agency proposed the aircraft could be used to rapidly drop six tactical agents for emergency missions, to help officers under threat and to descend on crowds from overhead, according to government records.

      <title>Recession over for rich, but working class far from recovered... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/business/article/The-recession-is-over-for-the-rich-but-the-15482561.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;U.S. stocks are hovering near a record high, a stunning comeback since March that underscores the new phase the economy has entered: The wealthy have mostly recovered. The bottom half remain far from it.  This dichotomy is evident in many facets of the economy, especially in employment. Jobs are fully back for the highest wage earners, but fewer than half the jobs lost this spring have returned for those making less than $20 an hour, according to a new labor data analysis by John Friedman, an economics professor at Brown University and co-director of Opportunity Insights.  Though recessions almost always hit lower-wage workers the hardest, the pandemic is causing especially large gaps between rich and poor, and between white and minority households. It is also widening the gap between big and small businesses. Some of the largest companies, such as Nike and Best Buy, are enjoying their highest stock prices ever while many smaller businesses fight for survival.  Some economists have started to call this a "K-shaped" recovery because of the diverging prospects for the rich and poor, and they say policy failures in Washington are exacerbating the problems.  Congress has not passed another relief bill, and the bulk of the federal stimulus originally passed in March to sustain small businesses and more than 28 million people on unemployment benefits has largely expired.  As talks between Republicans and Democrats in Washington have disintegrated, the burden of supporting the economy has fallen on the Federal Reserve, which has pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system to prop up businesses and markets, fueling a 50 percent gain in the stock market since March and a surge in home and car buying. But the Fed's main tools in this situation are reducing the benchmark interest rate and buying bonds. The Fed cannot give...</description>
