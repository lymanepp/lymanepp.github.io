      <title>Mexicans eschew hospitals, fearing doctors deliberately infecting...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/930357/mexicos-coronavirus-outbreak-worsened-by-widespread-distrust-hospitals</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The U.S., by a wide margin, leads the globe in COVID-19 cases. But its neighbor to the south has its own alarming spike, making it the third worst outbreak in the world. Mexico has had 52,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths, The New York Times reported Monday. A widespread distrust of hospitals has made the pandemic even deadlier, as Mexicans are reportedly frequently refusing to seek treatment until their COVID-19 symptoms have worsened past the point of possible recovery, or not at all. Additionally, the tendency to avoid hospitals has made it difficult to confirm the true number of coronavirus deaths â€” those who die at home often aren't tested, so their deaths aren't counted as part of the official death toll. Mexico's government says there were 71,000 excess deaths this spring, deaths that aren't officially COVID-19-related but likely point to an even deadlier outbreak. Last month, nearly 70 percent of Mexicans said they would feel unsafe taking their loved ones to a hospital for coronavirus treatment, writes the Times. The fear, of course, isn't unfounded. Almost 40 percent of those hospitalized with COVID-19 end up dying, data shows, compared to less than 25 percent in New York City at the peak of the outbreak. Deaths in hospitals also happen quicker in Mexico, though doctors say that's partly because patients wait so long before arriving for treatment. The vicious cycle has many fearing that medical workers are even deliberately infecting patients or allowing them to die, though no evidence suggests that's the case. Read more at The New York Times.

      <title>Trump paints Biden in picture many don't recognize...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Trump-paints-Biden-in-a-picture-many-don-t-15471574.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is increasingly trying to run against a Joe Biden of his own making.  Rather than look for campaign ammunition in the former vice president's long track record of politically vulnerable votes and policy proposals, Trump has instead chosen to describe Biden as a godless Marxist bent on destroying the country with a radical agenda that would make Che Guevara blanch.  The caricature is one that neither Biden's critics nor supporters recognize - but it's one Trump continues to promote.  To hear Trump tell it, the former vice president and longtime U.S. senator is "the most extreme left-wing candidate in history." Biden is going to "abolish the police" and "abolish the suburbs." Biden is even "against God."  In lobbing such extravagant attacks on Biden, Trump has concocted a profile of the presumptive Democratic nominee at odds with much of Biden's personal and professional life - a cartoonish depiction so distant from the reality of Biden that the hits don't always resonate.  "Generically, can you successfully paint a caricature of your opponent and be rewarded at the polls? Yes," said Pia Carusone, a Democratic ad maker. "But you can't just do that without understanding the greater context that the attack is falling in, and we're in the middle of a heath and economic catastrophe and people are very pessimistic about what they're hearing from candidates and elected leaders."  The most effective political attacks, said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, are often the ones that heighten an existing concern or voter perception about an opponent.  "There is certainly this notion that a bunch of wizards sit around and come up with this caricature and then spend hundreds of millions of dollars to drive the...</description>
