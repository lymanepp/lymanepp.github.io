      <title>TROUBLES:  Newspaper cost-cutting persists...</title>
      <link>https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/As-Gannett-GateHouse-merge-newspaper-14374389.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.nhregister.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) - Just a week after announcing its $1.4 billion acquisition of Gannett , GateHouse Media was again laying off journalists and other workers at its newspapers, possibly foreshadowing the future awaiting employees of what will become the largest U.S. newspaper company.  GateHouse and Gannett say the merger will allow GateHouse to accelerate its newspapers' move to digital while paying down huge sums GateHouse borrowed in order to fund the acquisition. But it's unclear exactly how it will make that happen.  Last week, more than two dozen newsroom employees and other workers were reportedly laid off at 10 newspapers, from Providence, Rhode Island, to Brockton, Massachusetts, to Oklahoma City. The Associated Press confirmed several of these layoffs with the affected employees, others in their newsrooms or union representatives. GateHouse did not announce the workforce reductions, and neither the company nor its owner, New Media, had any comment for this story.  Gannett also declined to comment, but pointed to previous public statements by New Media CEO Mike Reed in which he said the merged company would "not only preserve but actually enhance quality journalism."  The latest layoffs may not be directly related to the merger. GateHouse also reportedly laid off dozens of employees in May and this winter. Its earnings reports show that revenue is declining when the impact of acquisitions is stripped out.  Further newsroom cuts show that "GateHouse doesn't have a vision for growing revenue, only cutting costs," charged Andrew Pantazi, a reporter at the Florida Times-Union, a GateHouse paper in Jacksonville, Florida, and the head of a union chapter there. "Eventually they'll run out of costs to cut."  Many in the newsrooms and the communities that depend on those newspapers are mourning the changes wrought by...</description>

      <title>Fed Chair doesn't commit to deep interest rate cuts...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Fed-Chair-Powell-vows-to-sustain-the-expansion-14373128.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the trade war is a "complex, turbulent" situation and he vowed the central bank will "act as appropriate to sustain the expansion," suggesting another interest rate cut may be coming but not the large decline President Donald Trump has urged.  "Our economy is in a favorable place," Powell said, according to prepared remarks, but he added that there are "significant risks," especially from trade policy uncertainty.  Twice during his speech here at the Kansas City Fed's annual monetary policy symposium, Powell reiterated that the Fed's overriding goal is to ensure the economy continues to grow and the central bank would do what was necessary to make that happen.  "Our challenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind," Powell said.  Trump has lashed out at the Fed almost daily, calling on Powell to lower interest rates a full percentage point from just shy of 2.25% now down to 1.25%, the type of action that is typically done when the economy is in a recession or dangerous situation.  "Now the Fed can show their stuff!," Trump tweeted shortly before Powell's speech Friday morning.  In his remarks, Powell repeatedly characterized the U.S. economy as in a good place with low unemployment, solid growth and strong consumer spending, painting a picture of an economy that could possibly use a small boost but does not need massive aid.  "The U.S. economy has continued to perform well overall, driven by consumer spending," Powell said. "It will be appropriate at times for us to tilt policy one way or the other because of prominent risks."  Wall Street investors now predict a 96% chance the Fed will...</description>
