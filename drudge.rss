      <title>Trump campaign turns Iran attack into massive FACEBOOK ad blitz...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-campaign-turns-Iran-attack-into-massive-14960107.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Days after President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, the commander in chief's 2020 campaign turned the attack into a political pitch, purchasing roughly 1,000 ads on Facebook that touted his military credentials - and sought to raise money for his reelection push.  The online advertising blitz began late Monday as Trump's team sought to defend the killing of Qasem Soleimani, a major general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Many of the ads solicited personal information from voters that could be useful as the campaign seeks to mobilize voters on Election Day.  The digital strategy mirrors Trump's previous social media campaigns concerning impeachment, immigration and other signature issues, relying on a mix of narrowly targeted messages - along with headline-grabbing tweets seen by millions - to command the political conversation, mobilize his base and advance his policy agenda with an eye on the election. Trump's campaign also alerted supporters with a series of similar text messages highlighting Soleimani's death.  "From a campaign perspective, any time the president accomplishes something - and fighting terrorism is among his biggest campaign promises, keeping our country safe - that is grounds for making the argument that he should be reelected," said Matt Braynard, the data director for Trump's 2016 campaign who says he is not involved in his reelection effort.  But some experts bristled at Trump's tactics in the context of national security, stressing that the stakes are higher than usual: Every ad, tweet and social media statement from Trump carries significant weight in a rapidly developing conflict, they said.  "Growing campaign email lists based on fear and online fundraising for political gain should hardly be a priority of the commander in chief during a...</description>
