      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Jerry Brown is leaving office Jan. 7 after signing more than 1,000 laws in his last year, further positioning the state as a bastion of liberal activism and goad to President Donald Trump. The laws, most of which take effect Tuesday, ease criminal sentences, tighten gun restrictions and address climate change, gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The Democratic governor approved 1,016 laws, the most in any of his last eight years in office. His 201 vetoes also were the most during his final two terms, as lawmakers passed a record number of measures.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The federal government has been partially shut down for a week, hundreds of thousands of workers are furloughed, but there's no sign of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the veteran dealmaker who's brokered an end to so many Washington impasses. McConnell is home in Kentucky, and the senator's spokesman, Donald Stewart, said it's up to President Donald Trump and the Democrats to come up with a deal to end the stalemate over funding for Trump's border wall. In other words, in McConnell's view, it's not on him.</description>
