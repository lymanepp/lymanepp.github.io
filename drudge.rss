      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ATLANTA (AP) — Long lines and malfunctioning machines marred the early hours of voting in some precincts across the country Tuesday. Some of the biggest problems were in Georgia, a state with a hotly contested gubernatorial election, where some voters reported waiting up to three hours to vote. At a polling place in Snellville, Georgia, more than 100 people took turns sitting in children's chairs and on the floor as they waited in line for hours. Voting machines at the Gwinnett County precinct did not work, so poll workers offered provisional paper ballots while trying to get a replacement machine.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A NASA spacecraft has made its first close approach to the sun, just 2 1/2 months after liftoff. The Parker Solar Probe flew within 15 million miles (24 million kilometers) of the sun's surface Monday night. Its speed topped 213,000 mph (342,000 kph) relative to the sun, as it penetrated the outer solar atmosphere, or corona. No spacecraft has ever gotten so close to our star.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Election Day has Americans turning to our digital civics teacher, Google, with all sorts of questions on when, where, and how to vote. The top trending search Tuesday morning was "dÃ³nde votar," the search engine reported, which is "where to vote" in Spanish. "Where to vote" in English also trended, though with a smaller spike. "DÃ³nde votar" ("where to vote") is the top trending search on Google in the US today - spiking 3,350%.#Midterms #vote https://t.co/7P9QmWr3G9 pic.twitter.com/AQe5gkMw8V â€” GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) November 6, 2018 Some of the trending questions don't focus on logistics. As of this writing, "who to vote for today," "what are we voting for today," and "what do midterm elections do?" are among the less, uh, encouraging Google trends. Google also tracks which issues have interested voters most in the run-up to the midterms. Immigration and health care consistently hold the top two spots, with abortion, social security, and minimum wage jockeying for third. Bonnie Kristian</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;ktla.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With fewer than 24 hours before polls open, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) spent Monday afternoon stumping with Democrat Gil Cisneros, who’s locked in a tight battle with Republican Young Kim to replace her former boss Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton). Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said he was feeling optimistic about Democrats’ chances of netting the 23 seats they need to take back control of the House. If they succeed, Schiff is widely expected to take over as chair of the committee tasked with investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOSCOW, Idaho (AP) — Flyers with the slogan "it's okay to be white" were posted on the University of Idaho campus and around Moscow last week as part of a provocation campaign by white nationalist groups. The Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports the flyers were an apparent repeat of a year-old campaign stemming from online message boards, intending to create strong reactions. Washington State University Communications Director Phil Weiler says the Pullman campus was the site of the same campaign last year.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — A turbulent election season that tested President Donald Trump's slash-and-burn political style against the strength of the Democratic resistance comes to a close as Americans cast ballots in the first national election of the Trump era. With voters going to the polls Tuesday, nothing is certain. Anxious Republicans privately expressed confidence in their narrow Senate majority but feared the House was slipping away. Trump, the GOP's chief messenger, warned that significant Democratic victories would trigger devastating consequences.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A motorcyclist was injured in a collision with a Waymo self-driving car last month - but Waymo says the accident underscores the robot cars' safety, as it was caused by the backup driver. The Oct. 19 accident came days before Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google parent Alphabet, won approval from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test cars without drivers on public roads - the first company in California allowed to do so. It has not yet begun those tests, although its cars have operated without backup drivers on Arizona roads for a year. For Waymo, as for all of the carmakers, tech companies and startups rushing to develop robot cars, it's important to manage public perception of the cars' safety.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — For Democrats, the midterm elections have been a beacon in the dark, a chance to re-emerge from the political wilderness and repudiate a president they view as a dangerous force. But on the cusp of Tuesday's vote , many Democrats are as anxious as they are hopeful. Their memories from 2016, when they watched in disbelief as Donald Trump defied polls, expectations and political norms, are still fresh. And as Trump travels the country armed with a divisive and racially charged closing campaign message, the test for Democrats now feels at once similar and more urgent than it did two years ago: They failed to stop Trump then, what if they fall short again?</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) — In his final pitch to voters, President Donald Trump implored Republicans on Monday to help preserve "fragile" GOP victories that could be erased by Democrats as he closes out a midterm campaign that has been defined by his racially charged rhetoric, hard-line immigration moves and scattershot policy proposals. Trump's shadow has hung over the midterm elections that will determine the future of his presidency, with the monthslong fight serving as a testing ground for his nationalist appeals and the strength of the coalition that powered him to the White House two years ago. Acknowledging the stakes in the closing days of campaigning, Trump stressed to voters that everything is on the line when they go to the polls.</description>
