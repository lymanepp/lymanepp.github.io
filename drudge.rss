      <title>Navalny aide says doctors blocking transfer to cover up poisoning...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Navalny-aide-says-doctors-are-blocking-transfer-15504353.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOSCOW - Doctors at the Siberian hospital where Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is in a coma after a suspected poisoning denied his family's request to send him to Europe for treatment, though they said Friday his condition had improved.  With Navalny's plight already a rallying point for Russian opposition groups and others who allege the prominent Kremlin critic was deliberately poisoned by President Vladimir Putin's regime, the decision to block him from obtaining treatment abroad fueled anger over perceived interference from Moscow.  Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, accused doctors of endangering his life, suggesting on Twitter that doctors wanted to hinder an investigation by stalling "until the poison in his body can no longer be traced."  "The ban on transporting Navalny is an attempt on his life, which is now being carried out by the doctors and the deceitful authorities who sanctioned it," she said.  Alexander Murakhovsky, the chief physician for the Omsk Emergency Hospital No. 1, said Navalny was not well enough to be moved.  "His condition has somewhat improved as of 8 a.m. But, nonetheless, we have been unable thus far to fully stabilize him," he told reporters, adding that doctors have "five working diagnoses" but that he could not offer details.  Meanwhile, Ivan Zhdanov, an associate of Navalny's, said Friday that transportation police told him they discovered poison they deemed dangerous not only for Navalny but for those around him - so much so that access to Navalny will not be permitted without a full hazmat suit. Zhdanov said the authorities did not disclose details of the poison, citing an active investigation.  But that conflicts with what Anatoly Kalinichenko, the deputy chief physician at the Omsk hospital, told reporters two hours later....</description>

      <title>FOXNEWS RAVES:  'Enormously effective,' 'A home run'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/932719/fox-news-raves-joe-bidens-speech-enormously-effective-home-run</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden's presidential nomination acceptance speech is being hailed as a career best, even by his critics. And perhaps no praise was more surprising on Thursday night than that being directed at him on Fox News. Anchor Chris Wallace, who previously panned Kamala Harris' vice presidential nomination speech, called Biden's big moment 'enormously effective.' 'Remember, Donald Trump has been talking for months about Joe Biden as mentally shot,' Wallace went on. He added, 'I thought that he blew a hole â€” a big hole â€” in that characterization. â€¦ Trump is gonna have to run against a candidate, not a caricature.' Commentator Brit Hume also praised Biden's speech, calling it 'very good' and 'delivered with force and clarity.' His colleague, Dana Perino shared the view, saying Biden 'just hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth â€¦ He had pace, rhythm, energy, emotion, and delivery. I think if he looks back, he's got to say that was probably the best speech of his life.' Karl Rove added that Biden's speech was an 'excellent end' to the convention, calling the former VP's remarks 'very good.' Watch more of Fox News' surprisingly favorable coverage below. Jeva Lange Dana Parino said Biden 'just hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth,' followed by Karl Rove saying 'it was a very good speech.' pic.twitter.com/trWr5eyrJx â€” Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) August 21, 2020</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden gave the biggest speech of his career on Thursday night when he accepted the Democratic nomination for president. 'The current president's cloaked America in darkness for far too long,' the former vice president said. 'Too much anger, too much fear, too much division. I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. â€¦ And make no mistake, united we can and will overcome this season of darkness.' The speech earned rave reviews, with former President Barack Obama's chief speechwriter Cody Keenan calling it 'easily Joe Biden's best speech. He rose to the moment in a big way.' Added Politico's chief political correspondent Tim Alberta, 'We're watching an old ballplayer whose skills have diminished turn in a career-best performance in the biggest game of his life. Remarkable to witness.' The speech even received praise by some across the aisle. Conservative commentator Erick Erickson tweeted, 'Biden exceeded expectations. That was a fine speech.' Rich Lowry, editor of the National Review, agreed, tweeting: 'Forceful, energetic delivery, strongest when portraying his program as all about jobs, speech lost focus in the second half â€” but overall, probably helped himself.' Guy Benson, the political editor of Townhall, said simply: 'Biden crushed expectations.' Even those who've known Biden for years were in awe. 'After Biden mopped the floor with Paul Ryan in 2012 VP debate, I looked at him and said 'you will never have a better performance than tonight,'' tweeted Jim Messina, Obama's 2012 campaign manager. 'I was wrong. Tonight is better.' Jeva Lange</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Television viewership Wednesday for the third night of the Democrats' virtual convention, which featured speeches by vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama, rose to 22.8 million viewers. The Nielsen company said the Democrats reached 19.7 million for Monday's first night and 19.2 million for the second night. Four years ago, the third night of Hillary Clinton's nominating convention was seen by 24.4 million viewers. There was no immediate estimate of people who streamed the convention online. Democrats say their program was designed with online viewing in mind, both as a complete event or in highlights.</description>
