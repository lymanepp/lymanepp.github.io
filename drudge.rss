      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/925170/democrats-are-getting-really-confident-thats-making-biden-pelosi-nervous</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point in the 2020 presidential campaign, you would rather be presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden than President Trump. Biden has a lead of 9 percentage points in the polling averages by RealClearPolitics and The Washington Post, and 9.4 points as measured by FiveThirtyEight. He leads Trump, 'in some cases outside the margin of error, in recent polls in the battleground states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,' the Post reports. Democratic congressional candidates are also crushing their GOP rivals in online donations, Politico reports, setting off alarm bells among Washington Republicans. In fact, 'Trump's management of this summer's crises has triggered what Democrats detect as a tectonic shift in the political landscape, with party leaders suddenly bullish about not only taking back the White House but also wresting control of the Senate, as well as expanding their House majority,' the Post reports. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) predicted 'there's a tsunami coming.' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said 'we're feeling very good' about taking back the Senate. Not everyone thinks this level of confidence is helpful. Ignore the polls. Weâ€™ve got work to do: https://t.co/GCxsKwFY4h https://t.co/fnJezEaAg5 â€” Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 12, 2020 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told the Post that Democrats have 'one advantage' over 2016: 'People are vigilant, they are attuned, they are concerned.' Trump and his allies will try to suppress Democratic votes, she warned. 'I say: 'Own the ground. Don't give one grain of sand. Get everybody out.'' Longtime GOP strategist Mike Murphy, who opposes Trump, similarly said he would warn Democrats: 'Caution! Elections are very dynamic!' 'Trump and his advisers insist that their campaign's internal data show the race as more competitive,' the Post reports, 'and that he can gain momentum in the weeks ahead with a disciplined message and a brutal, sustained assault on Biden's character, ideology, and mental acuity.' Things can absolutely change, but over the past month at least, 'Bidenâ€™s lead over Trump has been both incredibly stable and unusually large,' Geoffrey Skelley notes at FiveThirtyEight, and he 'is verging on a landslide. Thatâ€™s not a word we use lightly.' Certainly, 'the president is in a very, very deep hole, and I'm not quite sure how he gets out of it,' said Amy Walter, national editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. And 'instead of just a slight drag, the president is tying anchors around the ankles of Republican candidates.' Peter Weber</description>

      <title>Tony Stewart's new auto racing league to give fans alternative to NASCAR...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Tony-Stewart-s-new-auto-racing-league-to-give-15404212.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his NASCAR career winding down in October 2016, Tony Stewart described his plans for retirement.  "People ask, 'What are you're going to do next year?' and I say, 'Whatever I want.' It's the first time in 20 years I'm not going to be on NASCAR's schedule," he said. "You look at all the stuff I've got going on."  Since then, Stewart has tended to his NASCAR team, Stewart-Haas Racing, and continued to race on smaller dirt tracks across the country. But on Monday, his retirement shifted into a different gear, so to speak, with the news that he's starting a new auto racing circuit alongside fellow NASCAR Hall of Famer Ray Evernham, agent Sandy Montag and former NASCAR chief operating officer George Pyne.  The new venture, as reported by Sports Business Journal's John Ourand, will be called Superstar Racing Experience (or SRX) and will consist of six short-track races starting next summer, with all of the races televised live on Saturday nights by CBS. Unlike NASCAR, the SRX races will be designed to maintain viewer interest in part by fitting into a two-hour window, with two 45-minute heats and no pit stops.  "That's enough time to showcase the personalities in a way that's fun and appealing and exciting," Pyne told Ourand. "Having close, competitive racing, you're going to get 20 or 30 lead changes in a race."  There will be only 12 drivers per race, and they will drive identical cars designed by Evernham with identical equipment. Plus, each driver will be randomly paired with a crew chief for each race.  The races will take place at smaller tracks in what Ourand describes as "the American heartland," and the cars will be designed to race over a number of surfaces and styles - dirt, paved ovals, road courses, etc. - to further differentiate the product from NASCAR....</description>

      <title>Strapped workers wait for delayed unemployment payments...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Workers-are-pushed-to-the-brink-as-they-continue-15403810.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexis Herdez has been filing for unemployment every week since April, shortly after she was laid off on her first day of work at a bridal clothing store.  But more than two months later, the 23-year-old in Lexington, Ky., has yet to receive any payment.  She and her husband have been struggling to pay rent and make their monthly car payment.  The automated phone system for the state's unemployment system takes her to a queue for a callback that has yet to come. Visits to state offices have been fruitless. While Herdez was finally able to get an appointment with someone at the unemployment agency to look at her case, it's not until August, she said.  The pandemic's toll on workers who have been furloughed or laid off like Herdez is measured in numbers that splash across headlines: 1.4 million new weekly unemployment claims and 18 million people are already receiving continuous unemployment insurance. Tens of thousands of workers at Levi's, Wells Fargo and United Airlines learned this past week they could be furloughed or laid off in coming months, sending those workers to seek jobless benefits as well.  Four months into the worst recession since the Great Depression, tens of thousands of workers like Herdez across the country have filed for jobless claims but have yet to receive payments. Many are now in dire financial straits.  "We've been only able to make half payments on everything," Herdez said in an interview. "We bought a large amount of groceries and have been taking things out of the freezer, but as the weeks go by, it's hard to figure out whether to pay bills or whether we have enough food to last the week."  The issue has spilled back into public view in recent weeks, as thousands of frustrated workers awaiting payments have camped out, sometimes overnight, in front of unemployment offices in states like...</description>
