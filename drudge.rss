      <title>Potholes, water woes: New Orleans seeks more tourist tax...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/c109e32e9265488b8532e2cbbbb79cde</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A night's stay at a New Orleans hotel can take as much as a 15 percent bite in taxes and fees. Yet barely more than 1 in 10 of those tax and fee dollars — out of an estimated $166 million collected annually — finds its way into city coffers in this leading Southern tourist destination. That's according to estimates by an independent research agency that last calculated the figure in 2015. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell's still-new administration says the city needs and deserves a bigger share.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) — The young men sit in chairs in a circle in a small meeting room in suburban Seattle and introduce themselves before they speak. It is much like any other 12-step meeting — but with a twist. "Hi, my name is," each begins. Then something like, "and I'm an internet and tech addict." The eight who've gathered here are beset by a level of tech obsession that's different than it is for those of us who like to say we're addicted to our phones or an app or some new show on a streaming video service. For them, tech gets in the way of daily functioning and self-care. We're talking flunk-your-classes, can't-find-a-job, live-in-a-dark-hole kinds of problems, with depression, anxiety and sometimes suicidal thoughts part of the mix.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;JERUSALEM (AP) — A day after snap elections were called in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emerged as the overwhelming early front-runner Tuesday, with rivals and commentators alike pinning their primary hopes of unseating him on a potential corruption indictment. With Netanyahu holding a commanding lead in the polls, all eyes are on Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit and whether he will decide before April's elections on whether to press charges against the longtime leader on a series of corruption allegations.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ROME (AP) — An earthquake triggered by Mount Etna's eruption jolted eastern Sicily before dawn Wednesday, injuring at least 10 people, damaging churches and houses on the volcano's slopes and prompting panicked villagers to flee their homes. Italy's Civil Protection officials said the quake, which struck at 3:19 a.m., was part of a swarm of some 1,000 tremors, most of them barely perceptible, linked to Etna's volcanic eruption this week.</description>

      <title>EARTH ALIVE!  Indonesia says avoid coast near volcano, fearing new tsunami...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/391e7f6e49154b13b5c7c7f2bded82cd</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CARITA BEACH, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities urged people to avoid the coast in areas where a tsunami killed at least 430 people over the weekend in a fresh warning issued on the anniversary of the catastrophic 2004 Asian earthquake and tsunami. The big waves that followed an eruption on a volcanic island hit communities along the Sunda Strait on Saturday night. The eruption of Anak Krakatau, or "Child of Krakatoa," is believed to have set off a large landslide on the volcano, apparently on its slope and underwater, displacing water that slammed into Java and Sumatra islands.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A clamor to create "Medicare for All" has exploded on the left. Democratic presidential hopefuls are racing to co-sponsor legislation, rising stars in the party are embracing it, and national polls show Americans warming to the concept. But even the idea's most fervent backers acknowledge that the goal is far off in the distance, beyond the next year or even the 2020 election. Their aim for now is to shift the health care debate.</description>

      <title>Summers raises chance of recession next year to 60%...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/814429/clinton-treasury-secretary-ups-chances-recession-before-2020</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The markets aren't looking good, but former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers says not to panic ... yet. Amid a month of falling stocks, Summers cautioned that "weak markets" don't necessarily mean "economic disaster is around the corner." Still, he's increasing his prediction of a recession from "a bit less than 50 percent" to 60 percent, he tweeted Wednesday. Summers served as former President Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary and directed the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama. In tweets Wednesday, he cited the assertion of Robert Rubin, his predecessor at the Treasury Department, that "markets go up, markets go down" to describe slumping stocks. President Trump shouldn't have claimed credit for August's roaring markets, Summers said. But seeing as "one can see essentially no trace of even the 1987 crash in economic data," Summers said we should remember "markets are noisy, flawed predictors of the economy." As Bob Rubin often told @whitehouse staff during @BillClinton Admin: Markets go up, markets go down. @realDonaldTrump was wrong to treat euphoric markets as validating his policies. And his critics should not suppose that weak markets mean economic disaster is around the corner. â€” Lawrence H. Summers (@LHSummers) December 26, 2018 Still, Summers went on to say that before December's tanking market he predicted a "bit less than 50 percent" chance of a recession starting next year. He's now increased those odds to 60 percent. Stock markets are still on track for their worst December performance since the Great Depression, especially after an unprecedented Christmas Eve drop.

It said Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw the test launch of the Avangard vehicle from the Defense Ministry's control room. In Wednesday' test, the weapon was launched from the Dombarovskiy missile base in the southern Ural Mountains. The Kremlin says it successfully hit a designated practice target on the Kura shooting range on Kamchatka, 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) away.</description>
