      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like a cocaine-fueled Homeric epic, Colombia's long tragic battle with the drug cartels has produced countless heroes and villains. But one figure cutting across the country's current narco battlefield, a name drawing praise and hate alike, is actually a six-year-old German Shepard you can find trotting through the country's airports. Sombra - "Shadow" in English - is a drug detection dog with the Colombian National Police. Over the last few years, her radar nose has led to more than 200 arrests and the seizure of at least 9 tons of illicit drugs. That success has turned the dog into something of a folk hero in a country consumed by ongoing bloodshed piled on top of a long legacy of drug violence.</description>
