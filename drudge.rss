      <title>LINCOLN PROJECT coming after Republican Senate...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/The-once-mocked-Never-Trump-movement-becomes-a-15402028.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The grainy first-person testimonial arrived at 2 a.m. in late June. A 40-year-old man with a thick southern accent - shirtless, the red ember of his cigarette glowing in the green twilight between drags - looked into his smartphone and began talking.  "Hi, my name is Josh and I live in North Carolina and I voted for Donald Trump - my bad, fam," he begins, before explaining that this November will mark the first time "ever, ever" that he will vote for a Democrat. "If Joe Biden drops out and the DNC runs a tomato can, I will vote for the tomato can, because I believe the tomato can will do less harm than our current president."  The unsolicited video submission to a group called Republican Voters Against Trump is just one small part of a broader "Never Trump" rebellion that began four years ago as a largely ineffective cadre of appalled Republicans, but which has transformed in recent weeks into a potentially disruptive force in this year's presidential race.  Groups such as the Lincoln Project and Republican Voters Against Trump - which is focused on first-person testimonials like Josh's - emphasize guerrilla tactics and scathing ads as they troll the president. The movement seeks to build a national political operation to oust both the president and his supporters in Congress, with a particular emphasis on convincing white suburban voters who consider themselves true Republicans to break from the president, according to interviews with more than a dozen anti-Trump advisers and allies who are involved in the planning, some of whom requested anonymity to describe private discussions.  Advisers to the Lincoln Project, which they say has about 30 employees and raised $16.8 million this quarter, will soon expand to include ground operations. They are coordinating over 2,500 volunteers in Michigan, and plan to...</description>

      <title>Fauci sidelined by White House as he steps up blunt talk...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Fauci-is-sidelined-by-the-White-House-as-he-steps-15401980.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - For months, Anthony Fauci has played a lead role in America's coronavirus pandemic, as a diminutive, Brooklyn-accented narrator who has assessed the risk and issued increasingly blunt warnings as the nation's response has gone badly awry.  But as the Trump administration has strayed further from the advice of many scientists and public health experts, the White House has moved to sideline Fauci, scuttled some of his planned TV appearances and largely kept him out of the Oval Office for more than a month even as coronavirus infections surge in large swaths of the country.  In recent days, the 79-year-old scientist and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has found himself directly in the president's crosshairs. During a Fox News interview Thursday with Sean Hannity, Trump said Fauci "is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes." And in an interview last week with Greta Van Susteren, when asked about Fauci's assessment that the country was not in a good place, Trump said flatly: "I disagree with him."  Fauci no longer briefs Trump and is "never in the Oval [Office] anymore," said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Fauci last spoke to the president during the first week of June, according to a person with knowledge of Trump's calendar.  For some administration officials, such developments have been an early sign their job was on the line. But Trump cannot directly fire Fauci, a career civil servant with more than 50 years in government service who enjoys strong bipartisan support in Congress. In any case, the president has no plans to get rid of him, said the official.  As for Fauci himself, although he is frustrated by the turmoil and the state of the outbreak, friends say he has no plans to abandon his...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaders agonizing about whether, and how, to safely reopen colleges and universities this fall now have another worry: The frat house.  In recent weeks, as students have trickled back onto campus, public health officials have been warning about an alarming spike in coronavirus cases that appear related to fraternity housing and parties that had been a staple of the college experience.

"There's no doubt that this is a massive change, a massive transition for all of us," said Judson Horras, president and chief executive of the North American Interfraternity Conference, a fraternity membership organization representing 6,000 undergraduate chapters and 250,000 fraternity members.

In a sign of the growing concern, the leadership at the University of California at Berkeley sent an urgent appeal Wednesday to students, noting that the number of coronavirus cases on campus had more than doubled in just a week. The majority of cases have been traced back to fraternity or sorority social gatherings, UC-Berkeley University Health Services' medical director, Anna Harte, and assistant vice chancellor, Guy Nicolette, wrote in a letter to students.  "At the rate we are seeing...</description>
