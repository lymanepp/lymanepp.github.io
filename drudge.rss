      <title>AMAZON FACES ANTITRUST</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Amazon-could-face-heightened-antitrust-scrutiny-13916551.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amazon could face heightened antitrust scrutiny under a new agreement between U.S. regulators that puts it under closer watch by the Federal Trade Commission, three people familiar with the matter said.  The move is the result of the FTC and the Department of Justice, the U.S. government's leading antitrust enforcement agencies, quietly divvying up competition oversight of two of the country's top tech companies, according to those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the government's work is confidential. The Justice Department is set to have more jurisdiction over Google, The Washington Post reported on Friday, paving the way for a potential investigation of the search-and-advertising giant.  The FTC's plans for Amazon and the Justice Department's interest in Google are not immediately clear. But the kind of arrangement brokered between the Justice Department and the FTC typically presages more serious antitrust scrutiny, the likes of which many Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have sought out of fear that tech companies have become too big and powerful.  The Justice Department this week declined to comment, citing a policy against confirming or denying investigations. The FTC also declined to comment. Amazon did not immediately have comment. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)  "If there is an active discussion of where the boundaries are, that would indicate there's a reason for that discussion, whether it's a new interest, study or investigation," said Maureen Ohlhausen, a partner at the law firm Baker Botts who previously served as chair of the FTC.  The early moves from the government's twin antitrust agencies mark the latest attempts by U.S. regulators to better supervise tech giants. Earlier this year, the FTC established a special task...</description>

      <title>Can Biden be both future and past?</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Can-Joe-Biden-be-both-the-future-and-the-past-13915734.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Vice President Joe Biden is off to a good start in his third bid for the White House. His opening weeks have set him apart from his Democratic rivals. For the time being, he is operating on his own timetable, at his own pace and rhythm. So far there have been no major negative effects to that strategy.  But there is a question at the heart of his candidacy, in part created by the focus of his campaign message. It involves intangibles that shape almost every presidential campaign. For Biden, it comes to this: Can he be both past and future? Can he be the custodian of a pre-President Donald Trump status quo and a candidate offering real change?  Two weeks ago, he held a rally in downtown Philadelphia. His speech was a compendium of personal reflections, political messaging and policy ambitions. His overall theme was unity and the need to bring the country together, across the partisan divide. One line, however, seemed to capture how he wants people to see the coming campaign and his place in it.  He was talking about the need for action on climate change. He had drawn some fire from climate activists for a comment attributed in a Reuters report to a Biden adviser, who indicated that he would seek a "middle ground" position on climate. To some it sounded like a lowering of ambitions, a retreat from big and bold action that many in the party favor.  Biden sought to reassure people that he views the changing climate as an existential threat to the planet, something he would take seriously and deal with aggressively. He also told his audience that the "first and most important plank" of a Biden climate policy could be summed up in two words: "Beat Trump."  His argument was hardly specious. He pointed to all the things that he - and the 22 other Democrats seeking the party's nomination - are talking about, all they would...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's brinkmanship with Mexico over immigration has opened a new and risky front in his global campaign to pressure other nations to capitulate to his demands, a strategy that has paid few dividends over 21/2 years and left his major foreign policy initiatives in doubt.  From his "fire and fury" rhetoric against a nuclear-armed North Korea to an escalating trade war with China to new ultimatums aimed at Mexico, Trump has wielded threats, insults and punishments against his foreign counterparts with diminishing returns.  Though he lured Kim Jong Un to the negotiating table through a "maximum pressure" campaign of economic sanctions, Trump's historic summits with the young dictator ended in failure after talks collapsed in February.  Beijing attempted to negotiate over Trump's push for a trade deal, but President Xi Jinping has met successive rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods with commensurate retaliatory measures, deepening an increasingly zero-sum clash between the world's two largest economies.  And although Mexico took steps to comply with Trump's hard-line immigration policies - allowing Central American asylum seekers to the United States a temporary haven - Trump's vow this week to impose sweeping tariffs unless that nation curbs unauthorized immigration into the United States stirred a public backlash.  For Trump, who campaigned on achieving "peace through strength," the consistent application of a tool kit of toughness has limited his options and left him in a precarious position as he accelerates his campaign for a second term.  Despite his pressure tactics, unauthorized immigration at the U.S.-Mexican border is at a 12-year peak, the tariff wars have sent jitters through Wall Street, and Pyongyang has resumed testing of short-range...</description>

      <title>New credit bubble ready to burst?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/A-new-credit-bubble-gets-ready-to-burst-13911193.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a speech a couple of weeks back that showed that financial regulators have learned many lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, but not the most important one, namely:  If regulators wait to act until they can say with certainty that a credit bubble is about to burst, they've waited too long.  That's particularly true when it comes to the opaque and unregulated "shadow" banking system on Wall Street that has now supplanted regulated banks as the leading source of credit for businesses and consumers. This shadow system gets its money from big investors rather than depositors, and it revolves around hedge funds, investment banks and private equity funds rather than banks.
