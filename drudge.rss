      <title>BALZ: Buttigieg has been surprise of Dem field. Where does he go next? </title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Buttigieg-has-been-the-surprise-of-the-Democratic-13782776.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is on a trajectory that few people would have imagined when he first formed his presidential exploratory committee. His poise and thoughtfulness have produced accolades on Twitter and cable TV that must make him blush at times. But his performance has made him the surprise factor in the Democratic nomination race.  What happens as the campaign moves ahead is the interesting question. History is an uncertain guide but still worth examining as Buttigieg tries to capitalize on the attention he has gotten. Is he a genuine breakthrough candidate, whose rise to prominence shatters both barriers and expectations? Or is he like some candidates of the past, who found a following within a segment of their party's electorate - or the attention of the media - but could not move beyond it?  Several past candidates come to mind in trying to assess the Buttigieg phenomenon. One is Barack Obama. Another is former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley. A third is former Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt. All had their moments. All were the subject of favorable and sometimes gushing media coverage. Only Obama went on to become both his party's nominee and president of the United States.  Obama is the candidate anyone like Buttigieg would like to become: a history-maker, an outsider who shook the system, a political meteor who flashed across the nation's screens but didn't burn out. Obama's 2004 keynote speech to the Democratic National Convention turned him into an overnight political celebrity. By the time he announced his candidacy for president more than two years later (and after election to the U.S. Senate), he was already destined to become the most serious challenger to Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic nomination.  Buttigieg's rise has been far more condensed - and limited. He formed his...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Venezuela in flames, China and Russia are seeking claims in the rubble.  But the United States has been caught flat-footed, and the Pentagon is struggling to develop ways to blunt the countries' influence in Latin America since President Donald Trump has antagonized and distanced himself from nations in the Western Hemisphere.  Defense officials have sought non-force options to deter China and Russia in Venezuela, CNN reported this week, through a mix of humanitarian missions and more training in Latin America led by U.S. Southern Command, the Pentagon arm that oversees a sixth of the world's land mass.  Yet experts said those efforts and others are in opposition to pressure and rhetoric from the White House, which has made significant demands to Latin American nations to curb migration and drug trafficking without offering much in return - all while ceding influence and support that Russia, and particularly China, have been happy to take over.  "The Trump administration's policy has supercharged China's increased presence in the region," said Benjamin Gedan, former National Security Council official under the Obama administration and a senior adviser to the Latin American program at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. "It's entirely counterproductive."  For years, China and Russia have sought more influence in the Western Hemisphere, but are increasingly emboldened to bolster their economic and security positions in South America, Central America and the Caribbean.  China has pledged to invest $250 billion there and reach half a trillion dollars in trade, while Russia has taken root to antagonize the United States and demonstrate its might. Both have invested billions in Venezuela, though some experts have questioned Russia's true prominence and focus on the...</description>

      <title>WOODWARD:  NOW WE WAIT FOR THE TAPES...</title>
      <link>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/04/19/bob_woodward_on_mueller_report_now_we_wait_for_the_tapes.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Watergate" journalist Bob Woodward told MSNBC's "Morning Joe" on Friday that in the wake of the Mueller report, he is waiting for someone to come forward with "tapes or new evidence." WILLIE GEIST, MSNBC: Having been through a few of these fights and a few of these administrations, particularly one comes to mind. What did you make of the report and what do you believe happens next?  BOB WOODWARD: Well, first of all, I think the report is quite amazing, and the Attorney General Barr did himself a mass of disservice because his letter quoted a portion of the report that looked like Trump was off the hook on obstruction of justice, but as we know on page 182, Mueller makes it very clear that they did not reach this issue because of evidence, because they could not make a determination determination. Joe may remember this, but the day Reagan was shot 1981 was it was Al Hague who rushed in and defined the way people were going to remember him by saying 'I'm in charge here.' Of course, he wasn't.  And Barr is going to be remembered for this because it was not -- it was just a deception and a misrepresentation of what this report shows.  Now, where it goes, I think it turns on the quality of evidence. In the Nixon case again, I'm sorry to go back but the tapes showed conclusively the President of the United States ordered the payment of hush money to the Watergate burglars and their overseers. He did it again and again, said, 'Let's blow the safe, let's break in.'  Now, in the case of the Trump case here, as Michael Schmidt I think was wisely pointing out, they stumbled, Trump stumbled. It was kind of obstruction of justice-lite. And as I reported in my book, there were lots of people who said, 'I'm not going to do these things that he ordered.' So where this goes, does somebody come up with tapes or new evidence? I think that would be the propellant here.</description>
