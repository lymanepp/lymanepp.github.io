      <title>Boris threatens to purge rebel party members as Brexit battle heats up...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Britain-s-Johnson-threatens-to-purge-rebel-party-14406878.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LONDON - Prime Minister Boris Johnson sharply raised the stakes in the Brexit fight on Monday, threatening to kick members of Parliament out of the Conservative Party if they don't support his plans to leave the European Union next month.  The move comes as Johnson and his opponents position themselves for a fierce showdown over Brexit on Tuesday when Parliament returns from its summer recess.  A cross-party group of opposition legislators, led by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, plan to introduce legislation to block Britain leaving the E.U. without an agreement in place to regulate trade, border security and other critical issues - the so-called no-deal Brexit.  Most lawmakers in Parliament oppose leaving without an exit plan, something many analysts say could be economically damaging and lead to food and medicine shortages. Johnson has dismissed those predictions as fearmongering.  Conservative rebels reacted angrily to Johnson's threat to force them out of the party, which would mean they could not run as Conservative candidates in future elections. A general election, as soon as the next few weeks, is a possibility if Johnson and his opponents fail to reach agreement over Brexit.  Nick Boles, a former Conservative legislator who quit the party over Brexit, told the BBC that Johnson's tactics meant the party had been "taken over" by the "hard right."  "The Conservative Party has fallen prey to an almost religious obsession with the hardest form of Brexit, which is obviously a Brexit with no deal," he said in a radio interview Monday.  This week's battles in Parliament will also center on Johnson's plan to suspend Parliament for five weeks, starting sometime next week, which will sharply limit the amount of time legislators have to debate the terms of the Oct. 31...</description>
