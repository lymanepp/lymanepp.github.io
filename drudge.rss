      <title>Winners and losers... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Winners-and-losers-from-the-November-Democratic-14851164.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Democratic presidential candidates momentarily sidelined the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday night, when they met in Atlanta for the November MSNBC-Washington Post debate.  Below are some winners and losers.  Winners  Pete Buttigieg: Buttigieg has been good in the debates, and now he's got real momentum in the first contest in Iowa, where a Des Moines Register-CNN poll showed him up nine points there last week. The question has been how he would handled the newfound pressure - and answer questions about whether a young, small-town mayor has the gravitas to win the presidency. "We need somebody who can go toe-to-toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that [Donald Trump has] been appealing to," he said, adding: "I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small. But frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small." On a night he seemed likely to be the target of many rivals' attacks his most tense back-and-forth was with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii. That's about the best he could have hoped for, given her limited constituency in the Democratic Party.  Amy Klobuchar: She's shown perhaps less momentum in Iowa, but she's rising slightly. And in a key moment, she turned what could have been a dicey question - about her suggestion that a woman with Buttigieg's experience wouldn't make the debate stage - into a crowd-pleasing response about a female president. She said Buttigieg was qualified, but, "Women are held to a higher standard; otherwise, we could play a game called Name Your Favorite Woman president." Then she brought the house down with this: "If you think a woman can't beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."  Marijuana: It took most of the debate, but Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., ultimately seized upon an issue that...</description>

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/885475/final-democratic-debate-2019-all-about-pete-buttigieg</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's no 'I' in team â€” but there are a few in 'Buttigieg.' The final Democratic debate of 2019 was largely about South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, as he racked up nearly 20 minutes of speaking time and found himself at the forefront of several squabbles. Buttigieg was attacked more than any other Democratic candidate, fielding at least nine callouts during the three-hour debate, according to NBC News. But Buttigieg didn't just play victim â€” he also went on the offensive 17 times. That's more than any other candidate, save for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who made 24 attacks. Buttigieg's name was invoked throughout the evening, including in a particularly testy exchange with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on the subject of his wine cave fundraiser. The two candidates also sparred over tuition assistance and, more broadly, campaign finance. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) wasted no opportunity to go after her fellow moderate on the debate stage, first calling out Buttigieg for parroting 'talking points' and then raising concerns over his experience and electability. But Buttigieg should rest easy knowing there was at least one other non-Democratic candidate who was attacked more than him: President Trump. Marianne Dodson</description>

      <title>From Hollywood to Silicon Valley, the Justice Department is backing corporate giants... </title>
      <link>https://www.ncadvertiser.com/opinion/article/From-Hollywood-to-Silicon-Valley-the-Justice-14918993.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ncadvertiser.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a battle going on for the future of American business. On one side are a handful of giant corporations that dominate their industries. On the other are the smaller companies they compete against, buy from, or sell to, and the workers they hire. And what you need to know is that under President Donald Trump, the Justice Department is routinely weighing in on the side of the corporate giants.  We've already seen the big-is-better philosophy in the department's approval of megamergers such as Aetna and CVS in health care, T-Mobile and Sprint in mobile phone service and movie giants Disney and Fox, which in some years account for half of all box office sales. The one time the department went to court to stop a megamerger (AT&amp;T and Time-Warner), it managed to lose.  Now, antitrust chief Makan Delrahim is moving aggressively to help the giants enhance their market power in new ways.  Last month, the Justice Department asked a federal court in New York to terminate a set of 70-year-old decrees that prevented the major Hollywood studios from owning and operating movie theaters. The decrees also prevented the studios from setting minimum ticket prices or requiring independent theaters to take blocks of movies - the likely flops along with the hits - rather than choose which movies they wanted to exhibit.  The department argued that the arrival of new studios such as HBO, Netflix and Amazon Prime, along with the advent of other distribution channels such as CDs, cable TV and streaming over the Internet. The brief also embraced now-discredited economic theories that mergers between producers and distributors, and business practices such as bundling and retail price maintenance, were good for competition and consumers.  Thanks to those decrees, Hollywood is enjoying a golden era, with more studios producing more movies...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BERLIN (AP) — Scientists in Switzerland have found a way to make brown chocolate colorful, without adding further ingredients. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology said Thursday that researchers discovered a method to imprint a special structure on the surface of chocolate that makes it shimmer and shine like a rainbow. The university said the process mimics the effect of chameleon skin, which can change to display specific colors. It said the rainbow chocolate is ready for industrial production and the scientists are already in talks with big chocolate makers. ___ Video: https://youtu.be/l3ZFZ_ApzGY</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who would have taken President Trump for a box office prognosticator? He briefly became one with a gaffe at his Wednesday night rally occurring at the same time that the House of Representatives passed articles of impeachment charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The president meant to declare that Democrats will experience a backlash in the 2020 election as a result, but instead, he briefly got the worlds of entertainment and politics all mixed up. 'They'll receive a big backlash at the box office,' Trump said of House Democrats, clearly trying to casually correct himself moments later by referencing 'that ballot box on November 3rd' as if that's what he said the first time. Then again, if Trump did mean box office, it wouldn't be out of line after his declaration in August that 'Hollywood is racist' and that 'what they're doing with the kind of movies they're putting out, it's actually very dangerous to our country.' Or perhaps he was actually taking about the Democrats' decision to hold a presidential debate on the opening night of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, predicting a huge surge in ticket sales from those who are specifically choosing not to tune in. As Trump might say, who can figure out the true meaning of the box office comment? Enjoy! Brendan Morrow Pres. Trump: House Democrats 'look like a bunch of foolsâ€¦Theyâ€™ll receive a big backlash at the box office.â€� https://t.co/O9l3h6v4WW pic.twitter.com/3mxqYeprIi â€” ABC News (@ABC) December 19, 2019</description>
