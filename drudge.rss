      <title>Allies, foes united in skepticism on redactions...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/US-allies-foes-may-have-different-takes-on-13777089.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BERLIN - Like much of the United States, governments abroad will watch closely Thursday as special counsel Robert Mueller's report is released in a redacted version. U.S. allies and foes may have very different hopes for that report, which is also expected to shed more light on the extent to which Russia was able to disrupt the 2016 U.S. elections.  But even though their interests in the Mueller report may be different, they will be united on at least one aspect: skepticism of the redactions by Attorney General William Barr.  The attorney general has said he plans to restrict only lightly access to information that would violate privacy rights, affect ongoing inquiries, provide insights into sensitive intelligence details or include grand jury material. Key members of Congress are expected to have access to a more complete version of the report.  And yet, the one thing that is almost certain is that there will be a battle over the things that won't be included. Democrats are likely to argue that Barr may have deliberately left out crucial details that would cast President Donald Trump in a negative light. Republicans will side with Barr, arguing that redactions are standard practice and necessary to protect other investigations and the integrity of the process.  But watching from afar, many Europeans are likely to share the Democrats' concerns: Often, in the past, their own concerns over redactions have proved to be justified.  That is especially true for countries where memories of the abuse of such techniques are still vivid. In what was once East Germany, authorities regularly opened letters sent to or from democratic West Germany and redacted passages deemed a threat to socialism, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. What became known as the "postal war" has deeply ingrained an inherent skepticism of redactions...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A bright fireball streaked across the skies in the Washington region late Tuesday night.  People throughout the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia indicated that it seemed close to them.  "Did anyone else just see the fireball in the sky in Ellicott City/Marriottsville?!!" someone asked on Twitter around 11 p.m.  Many people apparently did, throughout the region.  A man in the District reported "a huge bright Fireball with bright blue fire falling very close to Capitol Hill at around 11:30pm. "  In a message to a reporter, Kumar Shrestha said he was certain that a search of the area might find its remnants.  "It was very very close," he said.  A woman in the Arlington area exclaimed as follows in a Tweet"Guys!! That was a #FIREBALL that just came shooting through the sky- going due South along the #Potomac."  An Alexandria resident said she saw a large fireball "fall from the" sky.  The American Meteor Society, a clearinghouse for fireball reports, listed a dozen from Maryland and Virginia. Reports were also received at about the same time from other parts of the country.  Estimates of sighting times ranged from about 10:45 p.m. to 11:30 p. m. EDT.  Several fireball photos were posted on twitter feeds late Tuesday and early Wednesday.  Some of the reports to the meteor society indicated that the fireball made a relatively small visual impact. The accounts classed the experience as only one on a scale of five.  However, a witness in Fairfax County rated it as a three.</description>
