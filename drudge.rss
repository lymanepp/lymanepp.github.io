      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/933760/larry-kudlow-referring-still-raging-coronavirus-pandemic-past-tense</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, declared during his Republican National Convention speech that Trump 'successfully fought' the coronavirus pandemic, which is still very much raging in the United States. His use of the past tense was quickly picked up by several journalists, including David Corn of Mother Jones, who tweeted that Kudlow spoke 'as if this crisis is over. Thousands are dying every week. This is crazy propaganda.' Tim O'Brien, a Bloomberg Opinion writer, pointed out that Kudlow has been beating this drum for awhile now, saying on March 9 that the coronavirus was 'relatively contained.' In late June, right before a major surge in cases, Kudlow declared there was 'no second wave coming. It's just hot spots. They send in CDC teams, we've got the testing procedures, we've got the diagnostics.' On Tuesday, the coronavirus death toll in the United States climbed to more than 178,000.

      <title>White House role in convention raises Hatch Act concerns... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/White-House-role-in-Republican-convention-raises-15514687.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The White House is serving as the backdrop for several events during this week's Republican National Convention, raising questions of whether the production of the programming could run afoul of a federal ban on government employees participating in politics while on the job.  Unless they take precautions, White House aides who assist with the events could be in danger of violating the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from taking part in political activity while on duty or in a government building, or while wearing an official uniform or insignia, according to the Office of Special Counsel, which enforces the law.  On Monday, the first night of the convention, President Donald Trump appeared in two prerecorded videos shot inside the White House, one in the East Room and another in the Diplomatic Reception Room. The night concluded with a view of the White House in one of the closing shots.  On Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump planned to speak from the Rose Garden, and the president was expected to appear in two other events - a pardon ceremony and a naturalization ceremony - at the White House. On Thursday, Trump is expected to deliver his official acceptance speech from the South Lawn, which is set to host hundreds of guests.  The prominent use of the federal building in the GOP's quadrennial convention comes after numerous Hatch Act violations by Trump administration officials in the past several years.  The Hatch Act does not apply to the president and the vice president. But the law applies to executive branch employees who are involved in planning or executing any political events staged at the White House, including video segments filmed there, experts said.  And while the president and vice president are exempt from the civil provisions of the law, they are subject to two criminal provisions derived...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Genetic-data-show-how-a-single-superspreading-15512903.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of the biotech executives at the meeting noticed the uninvited guest. They had flown to Boston from across the globe for the annual leadership meeting of the drug company Biogen, and they were busy catching up with colleagues and hobnobbing with upper management. For two days they shook hands, kissed cheeks, passed each other the salad tongs at the hotel buffet, never realizing that one among their number carried the coronavirus in their lungs.  By the meeting's end on Feb. 27, the infection had infiltrated many more people: a research director, a photographer, the general manager for the company's east division. They took the virus home with them to the Boston suburbs, Indiana and North Carolina, to Slovakia, Australia and Singapore.  Over the following two weeks, the virus that circulated among conference attendees was implicated in at least 35 new cases. In April, the same distinctive viral sub-strain swirled through two Boston homeless shelters, where it infected 122 residents.  Scientists know all this thanks to a mistake made during the coronavirus's replication process - a simple switch of two letters in the virus's 30,000-character genetic code. This mutation appeared in two elderly patients in France at almost exactly the same time that genetically matching viruses were sickening dozens of people at the Biogen meeting. After the conference, each time the infection spread, the mutation spread with it.  Now, a sweeping study of nearly 800 coronavirus genomes, conducted by no less than 54 researchers at the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and several other institutions in the state, has found that viruses carrying the conference's characteristic mutation infected hundreds of people in the Boston area, as well as victims from Alaska to Senegal to...</description>

      <title>Cast himself as lifesaving hero ...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Analysis-Trump-uses-convention-to-cast-himself-15514532.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Faced with a pandemic that has killed more than 175,000 Americans, President Donald Trump used glitzy video and misleading testimonials to spin a tale of heroism and resolve far removed from the grim reality of a country in the throes of an uncontrolled public health crisis.  At the Republican National Convention on Monday, Trump was hailed as a bold and lifesaving leader who "was right" on the coronavirus while Democrats, doctors and pundits were wrong from the beginning. One campaign-style video that aired during the convention hailed Trump as the "one leader" who stood up to the virus while quoting Democratic figures who downplayed the severity of the virus in its early stages.  It's a revisionist version of recent history belied by hours of videotape in which the president played down the threat of the virus for months, falsely predicted that it would "disappear" with warmer weather, promoted several unproven miracle cures, pushed states to reopen before meeting government benchmarks, equivocated on mask-wearing, defied social distancing guidelines and repeatedly told Americans that everything was under control.  With the pandemic ravaging the country 10 weeks before Election Day, the president is mounting an effort to change Americans' minds about his handling of the crisis, relying on his background in reality television and show business to create an alternate reality that edits out his mistakes and zooms in on those of his opponents.  "The RNC is taking a 'Mission Accomplished' approach to coronavirus, but the fact (Trump) can't event hold a regular convention says otherwise," said Amanda Carpenter, a former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. She is a Trump critic who wrote a book titled "Gaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us." "American life as we know it has been shut down since...</description>

      <title>MAG: Black Monday for the religious right...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/933569/black-monday-religious-right</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The (eventual) resignation of former Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. was not the only blow sustained by the sagging structure of the religious right in the 24 hours from Sunday evening through Monday night. The other was the movement's total omission from President Trump's second term priorities. Right around the time Falwell gave a lurid tale of infidelity and blackmail to The Washington Examiner in an apparent attempt to set the narrative before an even more sordid Reuters report was published, the Trump campaign released its 50-point list of agenda items. As conservative commentators quickly noticed, there were some key exclusions. Like abortion. And religious liberty. And the Supreme Court. And the Constitution itself. Words that don't appear in Trump's list include 'faith,' 'prayer,' 'limited,' 'judges' or 'judiciary,' 'life,' 'liberty,' 'freedom' â€” in short, everything that was supposed to justify evangelical support for Trump has been dumped. The Dispatch calls this 'a fascinating glimpse into the evolution of the Republican Party in the last four years.' The American Conservative's Rod Dreher more bluntly charges that the GOP only 'exists now as a personality cult' for a personality who just made clear his utter apathy about abortion and religious liberty. I'd call it Black Monday for the religious right, a day that won't dissolve what remains of the movement from its late-1990s peak but may well be remembered for its symbolism in years to come. Trump's list is a betrayal of the transactional political relationship â€” exemplified by court evangelicals like Falwell â€” which traded conservative Christian votes for presidential protection. Falwell's disgrace, meanwhile, is a betrayal from inside the house. Though emphatic he shouldn't be seen as a spiritual leader, Falwell was the literal heir of the Moral Majority and head of a large, vocally Christian institution that takes as its purpose the training of 'champions for Christ.' His public identity is inextricably entwined with his father's movement, on which he capitalized while publicly refusing its spiritual responsibility (and, it seems, privately rejecting its moral standards). It's thus fitting, perhaps, that Falwell's downfall came in the same 24 hours in which Trump let slip that he's the winner of this transaction, that whatever he says about giving conservative Christians 'power,' the only power he cares about is his own.
