Miami-Dade County has the state's most COVID-19 infections reported per 100,000 people and the highest death toll, The Miami Herald reports. To try to slow the spread of the coronavirus, people in Miami must wear face masks while in outdoor and indoor public settings, with few exceptions. To ensure people take the ordinance seriously, Mayor Francis Suarez announced on Tuesday that 39 police officers will form a mask enforcement unit, working 'seven days a week.' Anyone who violates the ordinance more than three times will not only get a $500 fine, but will also be arrested. Catherine Garcia</description>

      <title>Taiwan says threat of military clash with Beijing on rise...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Taiwan-says-threat-of-military-clash-with-China-15425487.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TAIPEI, Taiwan - The prospect of a military clash in the Taiwan Strait is rising precariously, the Taiwanese foreign minister warned Wednesday, urging "extreme caution" in the island's dealings with a Chinese leadership in Beijing that he described as both increasingly emboldened and insecure.  The Chinese military has held a growing number of exercises that simulate an invasion of Taiwan, a self-ruled island about 80 miles off China's east coast that considers the United States its main military and diplomatic backer. The pace and scale of China's drills, as well as those of U.S. naval and air forces deployed to the region, have risen in recent months as relations between Beijing and Washington plummet on numerous fronts.  Relations took another sharp turn Wednesday after the State Department said it ordered China to close its consulate in Houston.  Defense Secretary Mark Esper said this week the United States would sell more arms to Taiwan as part of a $10 billion deal approved by Congress. He also said the U.S. military would reposition forces across Asia to prepare for a confrontation with China in flash points including self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its territory and has vowed for decades to take by force, if necessary. Inside China, the government has faced growing calls from hawkish military pundits and nationalist commentators to grasp the current strategic window to seize Taiwan, an accomplishment that could rally the Chinese population and burnish leader Xi Jinping's political legacy.  Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Wednesday he was worried China has conducted an "unprecedented" number of sea and air drills around Taiwan in 2020, with the pace rising to nearly once every day since June. "The threat is on the rise," he said.  Wu speculated that tensions in the Taiwan Strait - one of the...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Portland, the District of Columbia and other U.S. cities shaken by protests in recent months, the Trump administration has leaned on the considerable authority and assets of the Department of Homeland Security - an agency formed to prevent another Sept. 11, 2001, attack - to spearhead the federal response.  Images of militarized Border Patrol agents clubbing protesters and stuffing them into unmarked vehicles have alarmed civil liberties advocates and administration critics, and the displays of government power echo tactics long associated with authoritarian rule.  Legal analysts say that while the department has broad authority to enforce federal laws, officers' actions - especially in Portland, Ore. - seemed to be pushing the boundaries and pulling DHS into a domestic policing role.  "There's a line that it certainly looks like they've crossed. And, if I may, it's an important line because it's the difference between federal law enforcement and a roving commission where you're using these law enforcement officers to go out and restore what they deem to be order," said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.  DHS officials defended their tactics in Portland again Tuesday, saying the department has an obligation to protect government buildings in the city that have been targeted for more than 50 consecutive nights by black-clad protesters shooting fireworks, lobbing projectiles and attempting to set alight the federal courthouse.  Chad Wolf, the acting DHS secretary, said federal agents are not deployed widely across the city and described the situation there as "unique," blaming local officials who have eschewed cooperation with the Trump administration.  DHS agents have been deployed "to protect a symbol of justice - the courthouse," Wolf said. "We mostly do that in a very defensive...</description>

      <title>PELOSI:  'THE TRUMP VIRUS'</title>
      <link>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/07/21/pelosi_america_is_suffering_from_the_trump_virus.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said the nation is suffering from the "Trump virus," or the results of President Trump's handling of the coronavirus. WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: We are following the breaking news on President Trump's first coronavirus media briefing since April. Let's get reaction from the top Democrat in Congress. We are joined by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi, thank you so much for joining us. We have lots to discuss.  But let me start with the President's news conference he just had. He encouraged people to go ahead and wear masks, he admitted that things would get worse before they get better, eventually it will disappear. How far do you think all that goes in addressing this crisis that is still killing hundreds of Americans every single day? SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI: Well, I think with the President's comments today, he recognized the mistakes he has made by now embracing mask-wearing and the recognition this is not a hoax, it is a pandemic that has gotten worse before it will get better because of his inaction. And, in fact, clearly, it is the Trump virus. BLITZER: Well, what do you mean when you say the Trump virus? PELOSI: The Trump virus: if he had said months ago, let's wear masks and let's not - let's socially distance instead of rallies and whatever they were, then more people would have followed his lead. He's the President of the United States. Instead of being a bad example, like a manhood thing not to wear a mask. So, in any event, it was weird because a briefing on the coronavirus should be about science, and that is something the President has ignored. It should be about governance and, now, he's finally embracing - saying it is okay to wear a mask. So, I think a good deal of what we have suffered is clearly the Trump virus. BLITZER: So what you are saying is that thousands of Americans have died because of what the President has done or not done; is that what you are saying? PELOSI: Yeah. Yes, that's what I am saying. I think it's clearly evident. We're approaching four million - we're approaching four million people infected - people affected by this - infected by it, and a large number, like 140,000, who have passed away. If it's important to wear a mask now, it would have been important to wear it in March instead of telling us that by April we would all be going to church together. I wish that were the case, but he had no scientific basis for that.  And so, if they don't return to science and governance - and that's a way that we can overcome this. We have hope and prayers for a vaccine. God-willing that will be soon. But it is still months away and people will die. So, let's hope that the President comes closer to embracing the reality of this pandemic, this Trump virus.</description>

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/926773/former-bush-dhs-secretary-rips-trump-treating-department-like-presidents-personal-militia</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;America's first secretary of homeland security thinks his former department has gotten its mission twisted. The Trump administration has sent federal agents into Portland, Oregon, and has suggested sending them to other cities in what it claims is an attempt to quell violent protests there. But Tom Ridge, a former two-term Republican governor of Pennsylvania who former President George W. Bush tapped as the first DHS head, told Sirius XM host Michael Smerconish on Tuesday that's not what DHS is meant to do. 'The department was established to protect America from the ever-present threat of global terrorism. It was not established to be the presidentâ€™s personal militia,' Ridge said, alluding to the department's creation after the 9/11 attacks. Ridge did say he would 'welcome the opportunity to work with any federal agency to reduce crime or lawlessness in the cities' if he were governor. But 'it would be a cold day in hell before I would consent to an uninvited, unilateral intervention into one of my cities,' he added, specifically calling out how the federal authorities were unwelcome in Portland. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has defended the agents by saying they were stopping 'violent extremists' from destroying property. But the agents, some of them unmarked, have reportedly arrested people off the streets in Portland even if they aren't near federal property or seemingly doing anything criminal.
