      <title>Durant best in world? No longer in LeBron shadow...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Kevin-Durant-was-derided-for-taking-easy-path-13817756.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as a shy teenager, Kevin Durant expressed himself about one thing: his disdain for the nickname Durantula. He was a 19-year-old rookie phenom with the Seattle SuperSonics when people started to use the pun for fun, and he wasn't having it.  "Call me KD," he said then and still repeats now. "Just KD is fine."  Twelve years ago, Durant didn't seem to have many opinions. His life revolved around the gym and video games, and on most other matters, he went with the flow. But he was adamant about how you referred to him. He refused to let Durantula crawl into the NBA vernacular. He didn't want to let the obsession with his impossibly long arms and legs turn him into a thing. He wanted to be a person, an extraordinary one but still a person.  He lives by the introduction line on his Twitter handle, which he wrote 10 years ago: "IM ME, I DO ME, AND I CHILL."  Just KD is fine. Nothing else. So far in this postseason, Durant is playing some of the best basketball in his life, which is quite a statement considering his Hall of Fame resume: 10-time all-star, four-time scoring champion, two-time Finals MVP, one-time regular season MVP.  This is the platform Durant always wanted, even though he won't admit it. He's not in the shadow of LeBron James, who is home for the playoffs. More people love Steph Curry because he's a rather regular-sized dude and can make shots from the equator, but in these playoffs, Durant is the undisputed driving force on the Golden State Warriors. He's not riding their championship coattails, and in fact, that has always been true in his three seasons in the Bay Area. But during this run, he is carrying them more than usual, and finally you should be seeing him as a necessity and not the greatest luxury in NBA history. Unless you're some stubborn knucklehead clinging to outdated perceptions, Durant...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.hrw.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This report presents new evidence about the surveillance state in Xinjiang, where the government has subjected 13 million Turkic Muslims to heightened repression as part of its “Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism.” Between January 2018 and February 2019, Human Rights Watch was able to reverse engineer the mobile app that officials use to connect to the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), the Xinjiang policing program that aggregates data about people and flags those deemed potentially threatening. By examining the design of the app, which at the time was publicly available, Human Rights Watch found that Xinjiang authorities are collecting a wide array of information from ordinary people.</description>
