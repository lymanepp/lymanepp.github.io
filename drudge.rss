      <title>MAG: Black Monday for the religious right...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/933569/black-monday-religious-right</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The (eventual) resignation of former Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. was not the only blow sustained by the sagging structure of the religious right in the 24 hours from Sunday evening through Monday night. The other was the movement's total omission from President Trump's second term priorities. Right around the time Falwell gave a lurid tale of infidelity and blackmail to The Washington Examiner in an apparent attempt to set the narrative before an even more sordid Reuters report was published, the Trump campaign released its 50-point list of agenda items. As conservative commentators quickly noticed, there were some key exclusions. Like abortion. And religious liberty. And the Supreme Court. And the Constitution itself. Words that don't appear in Trump's list include 'faith,' 'prayer,' 'limited,' 'judges' or 'judiciary,' 'life,' 'liberty,' 'freedom' â€” in short, everything that was supposed to justify evangelical support for Trump has been dumped. The Dispatch calls this 'a fascinating glimpse into the evolution of the Republican Party in the last four years.' The American Conservative's Rod Dreher more bluntly charges that the GOP only 'exists now as a personality cult' for a personality who just made clear his utter apathy about abortion and religious liberty. I'd call it Black Monday for the religious right, a day that won't dissolve what remains of the movement from its late-1990s peak but may well be remembered for its symbolism in years to come. Trump's list is a betrayal of the transactional political relationship â€” exemplified by court evangelicals like Falwell â€” which traded conservative Christian votes for presidential protection. Falwell's disgrace, meanwhile, is a betrayal from inside the house. Though emphatic he shouldn't be seen as a spiritual leader, Falwell was the literal heir of the Moral Majority and head of a large, vocally Christian institution that takes as its purpose the training of 'champions for Christ.' His public identity is inextricably entwined with his father's movement, on which he capitalized while publicly refusing its spiritual responsibility (and, it seems, privately rejecting its moral standards). It's thus fitting, perhaps, that Falwell's downfall came in the same 24 hours in which Trump let slip that he's the winner of this transaction, that whatever he says about giving conservative Christians 'power,' the only power he cares about is his own.

      <title>Melania to give biggest speech in four years. Campaign hopes secret weapon... </title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/article/Melania-Trump-is-about-to-give-her-biggest-speech-15512286.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the eve of her big speech headlining the second night of the Republican National Convention, first lady Melania Trump appeared in front of the White House to talk up her husband's record on women.  "Since taking office," she said Monday at an event celebrating women's suffrage, "my husband and this administration have taken historic measures to empower and support women in the United States - and around the world."  It was a prelude to Tuesday's prime-time speech, her biggest since the 2016 Republican convention and a far more public and political spotlight than she normally seeks. With President Donald Trump's campaign strategists privately saying that suburban women are a weak spot for him, they hope she will help attract voters from that crucial bloc.  For the first lady, it also will be a chance for redemption. The last time she spoke at the Republican National Convention, she was accused of plagiarizing Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Convention speech. (A Trump Organization employee took the fall, though others have pointed fingers at poor staffing that meant no one had vetted Melania Trump's remarks.)  This time around, Trump - the only first lady who did not grow up speaking English - has spent days crafting the speech, according to a White House aide. She's leaning heavily on departing presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway, one of her top allies in the West Wing, and Stephanie Grisham, the former press secretary and her current chief of staff, as well as her top aide, Marcia Lee Kelly. Kelly, who is also CEO of this year's convention, has been closely working with Trump in Washington to prepare her speech in recent days, a person familiar with the matter said.  White House officials and members of the first lady's staff would not answer basic questions on the record, if at all, fully aware that she...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As wildfires continue to rage throughout California, residual plumes of smoke have drifted all the way to the Midwest, reaching as far as the Northwestern region of Kansas. The haze is expected to linger in the air for most of next week before the high pressure system moves toward the Mississippi Valley and potentially into some of the southeastern states, according to Matt Gerard, lead forecaster of the NWS in Dodge City.  "That's a lot of smoke to be traveling that far east," said Gerard. "Here, we've had some pretty bright red sunrises and sunsets, and the smoke up in the atmosphere coming overhead really gives the sky a grayish look."</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does it cost to mail a postcard? Don't ask the guy in charge of the United States Postal Service. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testified before Congress on Monday to face questions from lawmakers about controversial changes at USPS. But when it was Rep. Katie Porter's (D-Calif.) turn for questions, she decided to open with a bit of a pop quiz about Postal Service prices. For one, she wanted to know, what does a first class postage stamp cost? Fifty-five cents, he answered. But how much does it cost to mail a postcard? With that question, DeJoy was stumped. 'I don't know,' he said. When a surprised Porter shot back, 'you don't know the cost to mail a postcard,' DeJoy laughed and confirmed, 'I don't.' As Porter continued to ask some pricing questions, DeJoy admitted, 'I know very little about postage stamps.' He also said he doesn't know the starting rate for USPS priority mail, and he couldn't estimate how many people voted by mail in the last presidential election. 'I'm glad you know the price of a stamp,' Porter said, 'but I'm concerned about your understanding of this agency.' But to be fair to DeJoy, The Atlantic's David A. Graham quipped, 'he isn't the postmaster specific.' Brendan Morrow 'You don't know the cost to mail a postcard?' After Postmaster General DeJoy fails to name cost of several types of postage, he says, â€œI'll submit that I know very little' about postage stamps. â€œIâ€™m concerned about your understanding of this agency,' Rep. Katie Porter says. pic.twitter.com/0y4wQGZNku â€” ABC News (@ABC) August 24, 2020</description>
