      <title>DOJ ADMITS: Info classified AFTER govt review of book...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/921127/parts-boltons-book-werent-classified-until-after-government-looked-doj-admits</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The federal government's crackdown on former National Security Adviser John Bolton's new book is heavy on retrospect. For starters, the Department of Justice started its attempt to prevent Bolton's book from getting published just a day before it ended up in the hands of journalists. And, as the DOJ admitted in a Friday filing, parts of Bolton's book weren't even classified until the government got its first look at it, Politico reports. The DOJ's main argument for suppressing the publication and distribution of The Room Where it Happened is that it contains classified information, and that Bolton didn't submit it for a proper review. But several officials did get a look at it â€” including one who read the book before parts of it ended up classified, the DOJ said Friday during a hearing with Bolton's legal team and the judge overseeing their case. ! DOJ acknowledges that some of the material it says is classified in Bolton's book was classified AFTER the first reviewer completed her review on April 27. â€” Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) June 19, 2020 Current National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien then tasked National Security Council's Senior Director for Intelligence Michael Elliot with a second review of the book. But Elliot had only been on the job for two months when he started reading it, and didn't receive his classification training until the day after he finished. JUST IN: In new filing this AM, DOJ reveals ELLIS wasn't trained in classification process while he was reading Bolton's book. Got his training *the day after he finished* 'and concluded that the information he received in the training did not alter his decisions.' pic.twitter.com/0K6xkWhKUR â€” Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) June 19, 2020 Even after all of these government missteps â€” and after 200,000 copies of the book had been distributed â€” the DOJ argued Friday that Bolton should still be issued an injunction against its publication so he can 'focus' on stemming its further spread.

      <title>Trump reacts to intense Biden ad listing off  biggest scandals...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/921045/trump-reacts-intense-biden-ad-listing-administrations-biggest-scandals</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden might be starting to get under President Trump's skin. The former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee launched his first general election TV ads this week, and they're â€” uh, pretty intense! Despite being just one minute long, the ad manages to hit Trump for 'attacking healthcare for patients with pre-existing conditions,' 'giving massive tax cuts to billionaires,' 'praising white supremacists,' 'losing 300,000 jobs in a failed trade war with China,' 'locking children in cages,' and '[ignoring] science on coronavirus â€¦ now over 100,000 dead Americans, 20 million jobs destroyed.' The ad got a rise out of Trump, who took to Twitter on Friday to call out the 'fake ad' for being 'totally false advertising,' questionably claiming that 'I LOVE seniors [and] protect preexisting C's.' The Democrats are doing totally false advertising. They have done NOTHING for years, including when Sleepy Joe was V.P., and they now have a Fake ad that my China Deal is losing us jobs. Opposite, &amp; China is paying us $BILLIONS. Also, I LOVE Seniors &amp; protect Preexisting Câ€™s. â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2020 Watch the ruthless Biden ad spot, shared by Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko, below. Jeva Lange Donald Trump is apparently losing his mind on twitter over this ad so watch it and retweet it to share it far and wide. pic.twitter.com/WNSnmFZfr0 â€” Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) June 19, 2020</description>

      <title>In countries keeping virus at bay, experts watch US cases with alarm...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/In-countries-keeping-the-coronavirus-at-bay-15351626.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As coronavirus cases surge in states across the South and West of the United States, health experts in countries with falling case numbers are watching with a growing sense of alarm and disbelief, with many wondering why virus-stricken U.S. states continue to reopen and why the advice of scientists is often ignored.  "It really does feel like the U.S. has given up," said Siouxsie Wiles, an infectious-diseases specialist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand - a country that has confirmed only three new cases over the last three weeks and where citizens have now largely returned to their pre-coronavirus routines.  "I can't imagine what it must be like having to go to work knowing it's unsafe," Wiles said of the U.S.-wide economic reopening. "It's hard to see how this ends. There are just going to be more and more people infected, and more and more deaths. It's heartbreaking."  China's actions over the past week stand in stark contrast to those of the United States. In the wake of a new cluster of more than 150 new cases that emerged in Beijing, authorities sealed off neighborhoods, launched a mass testing campaign and imposed travel restrictions.  Meanwhile, President Donald Trump maintains that the United States will not shut down a second time, although a surge in cases has convinced governors in some states, including Arizona, to walk back their opposition to mandatory face coverings in public.  Commentators and experts in Europe, where cases have continued to decline, voiced concerns over the state of the U.S. response. A headline on the website of Germany's public broadcaster read: "Has the U.S. given up its fight against coronavirus?" Switzerland's conservative Neue Zürcher Zeitung newspaper concluded, "U.S. increasingly accepts rising covid-19 numbers."  "The only thing one can say with certainty: There's...</description>

      <title>Tulsa imposes curfew to prevent violence...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Tulsa-imposes-curfew-ahead-of-Trump-rally-to-15351712.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TULSA - As thousands of fans and protesters poured into this city in advance of President Donald Trump's first campaign rally in months, authorities imposed a curfew as fears of potential violence mingled with anxiety about a spike in new cases of coronavirus.  Metal barricades went up around downtown and police cars began blocking off streets after Tulsa announced a last-minute curfew for the downtown area Thursday night that will continue Friday and Saturday.  Officials cleared the area around the BOK Center where Trump fans had been camping for days in the hopes of being among the first inside the Saturday night rally that is expected to draw far more than the 19,000-seat arena can hold.  The move came after Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum declared a "civil emergency," saying law enforcement informed him that "individuals from organized groups who have been involved in destructive and violent behavior in other states are planning to travel to the City of Tulsa for purposes of causing unrest in and around the rally," according to his executive order.  Meanwhile, the Oklahoma Supreme Court is expected to rule Friday on a lawsuit filed by local citizens against the venue demanding that the arena adhere to social distancing guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or be canceled.  Trump joined the fray, tweeting Friday that "any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma, please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!"  The president's decision to hold his first campaign style rally since the pandemic began in Tulsa on Juneteenth weekend has angered many across the country and in Tulsa, and comes as the country is in the midst of a historic reckoning on race after the death of George...</description>

      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Twitter-labels-Trump-video-tweet-as-manipulated-15351108.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter on Thursday evening took the rare step of appending a warning label to one of President Donald Trump's tweets after the company determined it violated its policies on manipulated media.  The president tweeted a doctored version of a popular video that went viral in 2019, which showed a black and a white toddler hugging. In the version Trump shared, the video has been edited with ominous music and a fake CNN headline that says, "Terrified toddler runs from racist baby."  "Racist baby probably a Trump voter," the headline then says in a subsequent screen.  The video then cuts to the original clip of the children hugging, and then cuts to the message "America is not the problem. Fake news is."  The video received at least 3.8 million views, and more than 75,000 retweets.  "This tweet has been labeled per our synthetic and manipulated media policy to give people more context," Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said.  This is only the third time that the company has announced that it would take action against one of the president's tweets. Twitter has previously appended labels to a pair of Trump's tweets that made misleading claims about mail-in ballots, as well as another post that said "when the looting starts, the shooting starts" for violating its terms on violence.  Trump lashed out at Twitter after the company's initial decision to label his tweets regarding the mail-in ballots, signing an executive order that week that sought to punish social media companies by calling on federal regulators to reexamine a key legal shield that gives tech companies broad immunity for the posts and photos people share on their services.  Twitter's decision to label the tweets is the culmination of a series of quiet and incremental processes intended to dismantle a long-standing...</description>

      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trump-warns-that-under-Democrats-whole-country-15351097.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump painted a dire image of America if he loses his reelection, warning in an interview with his son that the economy would collapse, law enforcement would disappear and the "whole country will be Minneapolis."  His threat that without him the country would look like the Midwestern city was alluding to the looting and riots that beset the city for several nights following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in police custody. He did not mention that during the day there were largely peaceful demonstrations in the city (or that there's an entire meme about how nice Minnesotans are).  "I feel that if the Democrats get in, we are literally going to end up in a recession-slash-depression the likes of which you've never seen," Trump said. "There will be tremendous negative growth, tremendous bedlam all over the place, there won't be law and order. You'll have a Seattle, you'll have a Minneapolis like you've never seen before. The whole country will be Minneapolis."  Trump's dystopian prediction came during a 20-minute interview with Donald Trump Jr. on his online show "Triggered" that ranged in topics from which Trump child is his favorite ("All the same, 100 percent") to "Saturday Night Live" ("I don't find it funny") to Don Jr.'s quarantine beard ("I don't like it on you").  Trump slammed Democratic-run cities, specifically deriding the creation of an autonomous, police-free zone in a Seattle neighborhood and taking credit for easing the unrest in Minneapolis.  "The Democrat-run cities are the ones having the trouble," he said. "You look at Seattle, when you go to Minnesota and you take a look at what's taken place there, it's incredible. They tried to take over a great city, Minneapolis, and they had taken it over before I said, 'you have to send in the National Guard'."  Gov. Tim Walz, a...</description>
