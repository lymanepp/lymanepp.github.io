      <title>Jared's new assignment: Overseeing construction of border wall... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Jared-Kushner-s-new-assignment-Overseeing-the-14862516.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has made his son-in-law Jared Kushner the de facto project manager for constructing his border wall, frustrated with a lack of progress over one of his top priorities as he heads into a tough reelection campaign, according to current and former administration officials.  Kushner convenes biweekly meetings in the West Wing, where he questions an array of government officials about progress on the wall, including updates on contractor data, precisely where it will be built and how funding is being spent. He also shares and explains the president's demands with the group, according to the officials familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations.  The president's son-in-law and senior adviser is pressing U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the process of taking over private land needed for the project as the government seeks to meet Trump's goal of erecting 450 miles of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border by the end of 2020. More than 800 filings to seize private property will need to be made in the coming months if the government is going to succeed, officials aid.  Kushner has told other West Wing officials he is in charge of the wall, according to aides, and that it is paramount to Trump that at least 400 miles be built by Election Day.  "The point is to get as much built in the next year so, so the president can say in the face of intense, almost demented opposition he has made reasonable progress," said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank that seeks to restrict immigration and supports many of Trump's policies.  Trump campaigned on a promise to construct a wall along the southern border and to make Mexico pay for the...</description>

      <title>GOOGLE fires four, including software engineer at center of San Francisco protest... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Google-fires-software-engineer-at-center-of-San-14862049.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google announced Monday it had fired four employees for what it said were violations of its policies around accessing and sharing internal documents and calendars, amid rising tensions over what some workers say is a newly concerted effort by management to stifle the tech giant's freewheeling culture.  One of those fired was Rebecca Rivers, a software engineer who was at the center of a rally last week after she was indefinitely suspended. She was put on leave over allegations she had accessed documents not pertinent to her work at the tech giant. About 200 showed up for the rally on Friday outside Google's San Francisco offices to protest the action against Rivers and that of another engineer, Laurence Berland, who is accused of improperly accessing colleagues' internal calendars.  In a memo to all employees Monday, Google's Security and Investigations Team said "none of these individuals were fired for simply looking at documents or calendars during the ordinary course of their work," according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. Google spokeswoman Katie Hutchison declined to name the employees.  "To the contrary, our thorough investigation found the individuals were involved in systematic searches for other employees' materials and work," according to the memo. "This includes searching for, accessing, and distributing business information outside the scope of their jobs."  Rivers and Berland at the rally Friday denied that they had provided information to the press. Neither could be reached for comment.  Google has been seeking to more tightly control what information employees discuss after recent leaks, including those of sensitive projects, such as work with the Defense Department and attempts to craft products for mainland China, where Google is largely banned. Earlier this month, the company cut its weekly...</description>
