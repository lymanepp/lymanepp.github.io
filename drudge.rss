      <title>Republicans divided how to best attack...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Trump-and-allies-struggle-to-find-a-focused-15479925.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - In her first 24 hours as the presumptive Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Kamala Harris was labeled "nasty" by President Donald Trump, "phony" by his reelection campaign and "a far-left radical" by his surrogates.  The messages emanating from Trump and his allies about the senator from California varied wildly - casting her as both an overzealous prosecutor too tough on crime and an advocate for defunding the police, and as being so far to the left she would institute socialism as well as too moderate to satisfy her party's progressive base.  Meanwhile, Trump's allies in conservative media road-tested an assault on Harris as soft on crime, an avatar of political correctness and a danger to the safety and security of American families. Some argued that she was not African American because her father emigrated from Jamaica and her mother from India, and repeatedly mispronounced her first name. And in the darker corners of social media, some of the attacks were more overtly misogynistic and racist.  All that was before Harris made her first public appearance on Wednesday afternoon alongside presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who made history Tuesday by selecting her as the nation's first Black and Asian American major-party candidate for vice president.  The blizzard of attacks against Harris from the political right illustrated the urgency Republicans feel to demonize her as a way for Trump to recover some of the ground he lost this spring and summer over his handling of the novel coronavirus. The scattershot nature of the intersecting lines of attack also underscored the lack of consensus within the GOP about how best to take on Harris.  "It's clear that they don't have a message on Kamala Harris, much like they haven't on Joe Biden. They are flailing," said Christina Reynolds, vice...</description>

      <title>Covid-19 death toll rivals fatality rate during 1918 flu epidemic, researchers claim...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Covid-19-death-toll-rivals-fatality-rate-during-15481277.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The increase in deaths in New York City during the early months of the covid-19 pandemic rivals the death toll there at the peak of the 1918 flu pandemic, according to an analysis published Thursday.  The comparison, published online in the medical journal JAMA Network Open, found that the number of deaths from all causes was roughly equal during the two peak months of the flu epidemic and the first 61 days of the current outbreak.  The H1N1 flu pandemic eventually killed 50 million people a century ago, about 675,000 of them in the United States. The current pandemic has claimed at least 746,000 lives worldwide, about 162,000 of them in the United States, according to a tally kept by The Washington Post.  "For anyone who doesn't understand the magnitude of what we're living through, this pandemic is comparable in its effect on mortality to what everyone agrees is the previous worst pandemic," said Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who led the team that conducted the data review.  (The AIDS epidemic has killed more than 700,000 people in the United States since it began in 1981.)  There were 31,589 deaths from all causes in New York during the peak period of the flu epidemic, about the same as the 33,465 tallied in the 61 days after the first death on March 11 of this year, the analysis shows.  New York in 1918 had a population of 5.5 million people, so the death rate of 287 per 100,000 person-months was greater than the 202 of the current covid-19 pandemic. Person-months is a way of measuring the number of deaths in a population during a specific period of time.  But the current outbreak has seen a more dramatic rise in "excess deaths" - the number of fatalities above what would be expected in a normal year. With better medical...</description>

      <title> Iowa storm flattens 10 million acres of crops!</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/930959/hurricaneforce-storm-iowa-flattens-10-million-acres-crops</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A powerful derecho storm that swept through the Midwest on Monday has left thousands of acres of crops completely devastated, and officials say more than half a million people could be without power for quite a while. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) said the storm, which had hurricane-force winds up to 112 mph, destroyed at least one-third of the entire state's crops. More than 10 million acres were completely flattened, leading Reynolds to say she thinks the storm should qualify for federal disaster declaration. The Washington Post reports between 180 and 270 million bushels of corn were likely damaged, shortly before harvesting usually begins in September. The storm left one man dead in Iowa and one woman in Indiana. Teams are working to restore power, though USA Today reports full recovery could take weeks. Photos demonstrate just how dramatic and widespread the damage was: This is from around in Greene County, Iowa just NW of Perry Jim Smith the corn was suffering from the drought. Then we got a little rain last week. And now this. All eight of my corn fields look this flat and quite a bit of it snapped not just leaning. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/hFOTn1AZ7a â€” Jim Smith, Ph.D. (@JimSmith87) August 11, 2020 Continuing to see more and more pictures of the damage and it's devastating and unbelievable.
