      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few months after President Donald Trump took office, Lorne Michaels, producer of "The Tonight Show," was in a meeting with fellow television executives when one of them asked him about a threat to the late-night juggernaut. Was he worried that his program could face a ratings swoon because host Jimmy Fallon was much less political than rival Stephen Colbert? Michaels said he wasn't. "He brushed it aside," said a person at the meeting who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about it. "He didn't seem concerned at all. He just said that the pendulum would swing back, and Fallon would be fine." Michaels turned out to be mistaken.</description>

She thought she'd been invited out to celebrate her birthday. Instead, she said, her former pimp crept up from behind and dropped her with a roundhouse punch. Two men heaved her into a car trunk and they were off, forcing the woman to claw for her life in the dark as the vehicle careened along crowded city streets. Her life as a sex worker was dangerous, but now it had turned potentially deadly. Soon police were in pursuit across the Bay Bridge. Minutes later the car would slam into a pole in a fiery, fatal wreck.</description>

      <title>NEW TWEET STORM...</title>
      <link>http://theweek.com/speedreads/793295/trump-tweets-earlymorning-attacks-cnn-books-baselessly-claims-nbc-news-fudged-comey-interview</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump went on an early-morning Twitter tirade against his favorite media punching bags Thursday, first claiming that CNN's "hatred and extreme bias" against him has "made them unable to function," and suggesting that AT&amp;T fire Jeff Zucker ("Little Jeff Z") because "his ratings suck." Trump then said NBC News was actually "the worst," predicting that NBC News Chairman Andy Lack "is about to be fired (?) for incompetence" — the rumors are actually that he's in trouble due to Matt Lauer's sexual misconduct and other #MeToo scandals — and made a curious, apparently unsubstantiated claim that NBC News "fudged" the interview where Trump admitted on national TV that he fired FBI Director James Comey because of the Russia investigation. What’s going on at @CNN is happening, to different degrees, at other networks - with @NBCNews being the worst. The good news is that Andy Lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence, and much worse. When Lester Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia, they were hurt badly! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2018 Trump concluded by throwing "fake books" into the media bonfire and declaring that all media are the "Enemy of the People!" NBC News political director Chuck Todd seems to be subtweeting the president here, and suggesting you avert your eyes in embarrassment. I miss the days when people muttered nutty conspiracy theories to themselves while meandering down a sidewalk. Now they share it on Twitter w/millions of followers and for some reason some folks amplify it. Treat these tweets the way you’d treat the sidewalk mumbler, look away — Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) August 30, 2018 Certainly, taking the occasional break from the Twitter machine is good for everybody's mental health.
