      <description>&lt;b&gt;news.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nancy Pelosi, already the most powerful woman in US political history, has just launched an extraordinary and turbulent process which -- if it fulfills its goal -- would oust a sitting American president.

      <title>WASH POST LEAD WEDS:  Removal of U.S. ambassador to Ukraine latest twist... Developing...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Giuliani-ran-shadowy-Ukraine-policy-sidelining-14465570.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists - including the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani - to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev, current and former U.S. officials said.  The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments - all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani's activities from news reports.  Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president's phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump's political gain.  As those worries intensified, some senior officials worked behind the scenes to hold off a Trump meeting or call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky out of concern that Trump would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump's potential rival in the 2020 race, former vice president Joe Biden, and Biden's son, Hunter.  "An awful lot of people were trying to keep a meeting from happening for the reason that it would not be focused on Ukraine-U.S. relations," one former official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.  White House officials disputed these accounts, saying that no such concerns were raised in National Security Council meetings and that Trump's focus was on urging...</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/These-allegations-are-a-threat-to-all-we-have-14462676.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our lives have been defined by national service. We are not career politicians. We are veterans of the military and of the nation's defense and intelligence agencies. Our service is rooted in the defense of our country on the front lines of national security.  We have devoted our lives to the service and security of our country, and throughout our careers, we have sworn oaths to defend the Constitution of the United States many times over. Now, we join as a unified group to uphold that oath as we enter uncharted waters and face unprecedented allegations against President Donald Trump.  The president of the United States may have used his position to pressure a foreign country into investigating a political opponent, and he sought to use U.S. taxpayer dollars as leverage to do it. He allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world, to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests, for his own personal gain. These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent. We also know that on Sept. 9, the inspector general for the intelligence community notified Congress of a "credible" and "urgent" whistleblower complaint related to national security and potentially involving these allegations. Despite federal law requiring the disclosure of this complaint to Congress, the administration has blocked its release to Congress.  This flagrant disregard for the law cannot stand. To uphold and defend our Constitution, Congress must determine whether the president was indeed willing to use his power and withhold security assistance funds to persuade a foreign country to assist him in an upcoming election.  If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an...</description>
