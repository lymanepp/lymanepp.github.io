      <title>BITCOIN TOPS $47,000</title>
      <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-surges-past-47-000-012426395.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin hit a fresh record above $47,000 on Tuesday after Tesla Inc.’s announcement of a $1.5 billion investment in the largest cryptocurrency.The token rose as much as 6.3% to almost $47,493 in early Asian trading before paring some of the gains. Tesla’s disclosure Monday sent the price soaring.The company also said it would begin accepting the digital token as a form of payment for its electric cars. The developments amounted to the biggest endorsement of the controversial cryptocurrency by a mainstream firm. Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder and the world’s richest man, has for months been commenting about Bitcoin, buffeting its price.Tesla’s decision may be “a catalyst for other companies to go that route,” said Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, adding a new bull run is underway in the token.A rally was also evident in Bitcoin futures, suggesting shorts are throwing in the towel and signaling traders won’t fight the crypto advance. The wider Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which includes Bitcoin, Ether and three other tokens, jumped to a record.Japanese and South Korean cryptocurrency-exposed stocks rose, tracking a rally in their U.S. and European peers.Bitcoin’s journey to its latest summit came with big swings that continue to stoke controversy about its outlook. Predictions for its possible long-term price range from $400,000 and more to zero.Proponents cite backing from the likes of Musk and signs of interest from long-term investors as evidence of a durable rally. They also envisage a role for the token as a hedge for risks such as faster inflation, akin to gold.Others continue to see speculators at work and are reminded of the 2017 boom that turned to bust. The token is designed to have a fixed supply of 21 million coins, underpinned by a digital ledger distributed across computer networks.Bitcoin has more than quadrupled over the past year. Commentators have cited day traders, wealthy buyers, hedge funds, companies and even signs of interest from usually staid investors like insurers for the climb.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</description>

      <title>Junk-bond yields drop below 4% for the first time ever...</title>
      <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-junk-bond-yields-drop-231257469.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Bloomberg) -- The average yield on U.S. junk bonds dropped below 4% for the first time ever as investors seeking a haven from ultra-low interest rates keep piling into an asset class historically known for its high yields.The measure for the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate High-Yield index dipped to 3.96% on Monday evening, making it six straight sessions of declines.Yield-hungry investors have been gobbling up junk bonds as an alternative to the meager income offered in less-risky bond markets. Demand for the debt has outweighed supply by so much that some money managers are even calling companies to press them to borrow instead of waiting for deals to come their way. A majority of new issues, even those rated in the riskiest CCC tier of junk, have been hugely oversubscribed.The lower yields should encourage more speculative-grade companies to tap the market after raising more than $7 billion last week. January was a record month for sales with $52 billion priced, and year-to-date volume stands at about $60 billion.Buyers have been snapping up CCC graded issues as yields for that slice of high yield also decline. They dropped to 6.21% on Monday, also a record low, and have outperformed the rest of the market for three consecutive months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Notes rates in the single-B tier yield an average 4.30%, while those in the BB range yield 3.05%, the data show.Issuance conditions have been so conducive that some of the riskiest types of transactions come to market, such as bonds that are used to fund dividends to a company’s owners and so-called pay-in-kind bonds that allow a borrower to pay interest with more debt.Some see continued outperformance from the junkiest part of the market. CCCs, which have accounted for a significant chunk of recent supply, may be one of the best parts of credit this year, according to David Norris, head of U.S. credit at TwentyFour Asset Management. “This robust new issue pipeline of lower-quality credit is worth poring over as there are likely to be some good stories in here for investors with sufficient liquidity to get involved,” he said.(Updates with rating-bucket yields in fifth paragraph. A previous version of this story was corrected to note that the index declined for six straight sessions in second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</description>
