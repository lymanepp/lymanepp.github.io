      <title>President says Biden 'deserted' PA. In Scranton, he's 'hometown boy'...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-tries-to-downplay-generations-of-family-13866122.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the 1950s, Scranton, Pennslyvania, was at the start of a long, slow decline. The coal mines that had fueled the city's early prosperity were shutting down, leaving residents to cope with gaping sinkholes and a scarred landscape. Textile factories, too, were on their way out, and thousands of people picked up and left for better opportunities elsewhere. Joining the exodus were 10-year-old Joe Biden and his family.  Unable to find a steady source of work, Biden's father, Joe Sr., had been commuting to Wilmington, Delaware, to clean boilers. By 1953, he decided it was time to move the whole family across the state lines.  Biden, who was in grade school at the time, presumably didn't have much say in the matter. But that didn't stop PresidentDonald Trump from declaring on Monday night that the Democratic presidential contender had abandoned Pennsylvania.  "Biden deserted you," he told the crowd at a campaign rally in Montoursville, Pennslyvania, located about 80 miles west of Scranton. "I guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state."  The eyebrow-raising assertion received only a muted response from the audience, suggesting that even Trump's die-hard supporters weren't necessarily sold on the claim. Over the years, Biden has repeatedly referenced his Scranton roots, which pundits see as a strategic political move geared to appeal to working-class voters in a crucial swing state. But locals have consistently insisted that his affection for the hardscrabble city is genuine.  "You think it's an opportunist thing, but it's not," his childhood friend, Tom Bell, told the Scranton Times-Tribune in 2008. "The guy's that way. He's always been. Before he was even in the limelight."  The former vice president's ties to the area go back generations. Biden, a noted genealogy enthusiast, took part in a...</description>
