      <title>Showdowns at political conventions are rare. Dems may get one...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speculation about a brokered, deadlocked or contested political conventionsurfaceseveryfouryears with the regularity of Brigadoon rising from the mist. Back in 1980, self-styled Democratic brokers called themselves the "wait in the weeds gang," ready to identify a compromise candidate between President Jimmy Carter and Sen. Ted Kennedy. Such predictions show up in virtually every cycle when there's even a hint of the possibility - usually early on, when a platoon of still-viable candidates suggests that a divided primary contest will fail to produce a winner. Just as frequent are the skeptical dismissals (I wrote one myself a dozen years ago) that note, with metronomic regularity, that there aren't any more brokers: no more Jake Arveys, Ed Flynns, Mark Hannas or Harry Daughertys to trade delegates like so many poker chips.  But this could be the year it really does happen. The Democrats may arrive in Milwaukee in July with no candidate having locked down enough delegates to win the nomination on the first vote. Three factors are present, even dominant, in the Democratic fight that are often absent: a genuine ideological split; four candidates (and possibly more) with enough money to wage long campaigns; and the long-standing Democratic method of allocating delegates proportionally, which can drag out primaries even if the outcome is clear months before the convention - which it certainly isn't today.  Conventions were not always the slick infomercials they've become in recent years, and the shift to primaries instead of smoke-filled rooms after the chaotic 1968 Democratic convention didn't immediately end the prospect of floor fights. In 1972, George McGovern beat back an attempt to deny him a first-ballot victory by contesting his right to all the delegates from California's winner-take-all primary. (He'd won 43.5...</description>

      <title>A woman was killed and skinned. Now Mexico is up in arms...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/A-woman-was-killed-and-skinned-Now-Mexico-is-up-15057813.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MEXICO CITY - One morning this week, Mexico City police received a radio call about an "aggression against a woman." Arriving at the scene - an apartment in a lower-middle-class neighborhood - they discovered a horror: the body of a 25-year-old who had been stabbed to death, cut up and partially skinned.  The killing of Ingrid Escamilla last weekend has gripped the nation and ignited a fresh round of protests over Mexico's high levels of violence against women.  On Friday, demonstrators hurled paint at the entrance to the National Palace to protest Escamilla's death and other "femicides" - murders of women because of their gender. Additional protests were planned for Friday evening and Saturday.  Escamilla's case shocked Mexicans not only because her death was so gruesome but because it was so publicized. Photos of her mutilated body were leaked to two tabloids. One of them, Pasala, headlined a photo spread, "It was Cupid's fault."  Mexicans struck back on social media, insisting that Escamilla should be memorialized not by such ghastly photos but instead by beautiful images. Thousands of people posted or shared pictures of flowers, rainbows and animals, using hashtags such as #IngridEscamilla and #IngridFotos.  "You deserve to be remembered for who you were, not what they did to you," said Twitter user @itsamonbebe, who posted nature pictures.  Prominent figures including the writer Valeria Luiselli and Mexico's ambassador to Washington, Martha Bárcena, joined the campaign.  Escamilla's husband confessed to the crime, according to media reports. The city's public security department confirmed his arrest.  Mexicans have voiced increasing frustration with violence against women. The country recorded more than 1,000 deaths classified as femicides last year, part of a historic...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rudy Giuliani has a fresh crop of claims about Democrats' dealings in Ukraine â€” an iPad full of 'proof' he won't let anyone else see. The former New York City mayor made a Fox Business appearance on Thursday night to push any corruption in Ukraine on Democrats' shoulders. 'They're going to be very surprised when they see the report that I have' apparently revealing an 'unaccounted for' $5.3 billion in Ukraine aid during the Obama administration, Giuliani said, not exactly specifying who 'they' are. That aid gap apparently explains 'how all those oligarchs become oligarchs,' Giuliani said, making some chomping noises and motions to imitate his interpretation of how money is laundered. Giuliani goes on to mention this mysterious report over and over, which apparently shows how 'not just' the Bidens engaged in a 'huge Democratic scam' in Ukraine. 'That's why they're so crazy on the subject of Ukraine, and why they want to literally kill me,' Giuliani said of Democrats, without any proof of this murderous plot. 'I don't think it. I can prove it,' Giuliani claimed again before breaking out a tablet containing a 'document' that does just that â€” not that he actually shows it to the audience. .@RudyGiuliani says there is more to this #Ukraine corruption scandal than the #Bidens - #Giuliani says he has the proof, and he's ready to EXPOSE the corruption - and that's why people are after him, watch: #TrishRegan pic.twitter.com/sjYstoyUdE â€” Trish Regan (@trish_regan) February 14, 2020 Giuliani hasn't publicized any proof for his claims, and more than 12 hours after claiming 'we're gonna reveal the whole thing,' still hasn't done so.
