      <link>https://apnews.com/49f4e16c0e674a1391525a6f7d7db43b</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Suddenly facing life under divided government, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders talked bipartisanship Wednesday but then bluntly previewed the fault lines to come. Trump threatened to go after House Democrats who try to investigate him, while Rep. Nancy Pelosi said her party would be "a check and balance" against the White House. The day after midterm elections reset Washington, Trump took a victory lap at a raucous news conference, celebrating Republican Senate wins but distancing himself from the GOP's loss of the House. He said he was interested in working with House Democrats but was ready to respond if he felt he was being ill-treated.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned on Wednesday at President Donald Trump's request, ending the tenure of a beleaguered loyalist whose relationship with the president was ruined when Sessions recused himself from control of the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. In a letter to Trump, Sessions wrote he had been "honored to serve as Attorney General" and had "worked to implement the law enforcement agenda based on the rule of law that formed a central part of your campaign for the presidency." Trump tweeted that Sessions would be replaced on an acting basis by Matthew Whitaker, who had been serving as Sessions' chief of staff.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Americans take out roughly $50 billion in payday loans a year, each racking up hundreds of dollars in fees and interest. But a small and growing service that allows its users to take an advance on their paycheck might be giving the payday loan industry a run for its money. San Francisco-based financial technology company Even made headlines late last year when Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, announced it would start offering Even's service as part of its employee benefits package. Along with providing tools that allow employees to track their spending and save money, Even features Instapay, which allows users to advance some of their next paycheck up to 13 days before payday. Because the Even user is tapping into his or her already accumulated hours, Even doesn't charge the employee interest on the advance.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.timesunion.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Millbrook  Modern medicines are moving through sewage treatment systems and into aquatic insects and the animals that eat them, according to an environmental study in Australia that involved a Hudson Valley environmental researcher.  Tests of six Australian streams near the city of Melbourne found animals there contained high doses of painkillers, antidepressants and other drugs that had gotten into the water after passing through municipal sewer systems that are unequipped to remove them.  "Stream life is swimming in a mixture of pharmaceuticals," said Emma Rosi, an aquatic ecologist at Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, based in Milbrook, Dutchess County. "While this study was in Australia, there is no reason to think it would be any different in the Hudson River, or any other place where there are people and drugs."  Rossi, along with Australian and Swedish researchers, examined caddisflies, spiders, and other insects, as well as platypus and brown trout, which are predators of such aquatic life in that region, for 98 different medical drugs between 2014 and 2015. They found 69 of the drugs.</description>
