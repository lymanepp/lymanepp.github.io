      <title>President floats 'powerful death penalty' for drug dealers...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/895056/trump-floats-death-penalty-drug-dealers--big-twist-from-criminal-justice-push</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump's latest comments about China would be ironic if they weren't so disturbing. Trump hosted governors from around the country on Monday and gave a wide-ranging speech where he complained about the European Union's apparent bullying and then totally reversed his stance on criminal justice reform. While Trump touted clemency for drug offenders as recently as in his Super Bowl ad, he complimented China's 'maximum penalty' for 'drug dealers' and how it's led to the country having 'very little drug problem.' Trump first complimented what's going on in the authoritarian government of China, and then praised some of the governors in front of him. 'States with a very powerful death penalty on drug dealers don't have a drug problem,' Trump said, though he added 'I don't know if our country is ready for that.' Trump suggests he'd like to model American criminal law on drug dealing on authoritarian systems like China, where dealers are executed: 'Countries with a powerful death penalty, with a fair but quick trial, they have very little if any drug problem. That includes China.' pic.twitter.com/9WprysjJAX â€” Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 10, 2020 In contrast, Trump's Super Bowl ad featured Alice Marie Johnson thanking the president for granting her clemency after she'd been in prison for more than 20 years on drug-related charges. The ad was reportedly Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's way of appealing to black voters. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>Top candidates turn on one another...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Top-Democrats-turn-on-one-another-after-Iowa-15043098.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MANCHESTER, N.H. - Democratic leaders have edged toward the brink of open war with each other in recent days after a series of jarring setbacks that could jeopardize the party's chances against President Donald Trump, who continues to solidify his iron-fisted control over the Republican election apparatus.  The infighting focuses largely on the failed caucus process in Iowa, with state and national Democratic leaders at odds over who deserves blame, as well as an increasingly bitter dispute over the rules governing who gets into future nationally televised candidate debates - a process that could allow billionaire Mike Bloomberg to make the stage later this month.  In a particularly stark sign, supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have returned to bashing the Democratic National Committee, reviving grievances from the divisive 2016 primary race. In that campaign, Sanders backers said the system had been stacked against the democratic socialist - a view later affirmed when WikiLeaks released hacked internal emails - and supporters of nominee Hillary Clinton blamed Sanders for not sufficiently rally his base on Clinton's behalf in the general election.  Sanders's allies are again charging that the DNC is maneuvering to thwart his anti-establishment movement. They say the DNC's decision last week to call for a "recanvass" in Iowa threatened to undercut Sanders's ability to claim momentum from winning the popular vote there, while changing the rules to benefit Bloomberg reflects the desire among the party elite for a savior to deny Sanders the nomination.  "They can shout unity all they want, but the actions show otherwise," said Nina Turner, a national co-chairman of the Sanders campaign.  The brew of resentment and anxiety represents a sharp turn for a presidential primary race that began last year with a historically...</description>
