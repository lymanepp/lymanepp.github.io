We've heard about the heart, lungs and respiratory symptoms, but a growing mystery is its impact on the nervous system.</description>

      <title>How legal fight against big tech is like fight against organized crime...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/opinion/article/The-legal-fight-against-big-tech-is-like-the-15451330.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Wednesday, the House's top antitrust subcommittee grilled big-tech CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos, who appeared via videoconferencing software. Some people called it tech's "Big Tobacco moment" while others compared it with past antitrust investigations of Microsoft and AT&amp;T. To me, the hearing - and the ongoing investigations - conjured another set of hearings from 70 years ago: the probe into mob activity led by Sen. Estes Kefauver, D-Tenn.  Those hearings led to a wave of enforcement, new laws and eventually, in 1970, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. What we learned at Wednesday's hearing suggests the behavior of Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon calls for a comparably comprehensive and forceful response. (Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)  There are more than a few similarities between the organized crime and these four companies. Like the Mafia, the threats that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google pose to American democracy flow from the power they have over key services (from email to social media to music and film), the way they use dominance in one area to achieve dominance in others and their ability to use fear to stop challenges to their control.  Like the Mafia, they are a resilient, surveillance-based shadow government. So citizens are dual subjects - of the country, and of the flawed online markets created by these companies. Like the mob, big tech has friends in very high places. Likewise, big tech is an oligarchy with several bosses, who compete in some territories but generally divide power among themselves, without consulting elected officials.  Obviously, I am not saying Facebook and Google murder and kneecap their opponents, or burn down businesses that refuse to play by their rules; I am not equating tech...</description>

      <title>In coastal Maine, the perfect pace for self-quarantining...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/travel/article/In-coastal-Maine-the-perfect-pace-for-15449055.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been an annual ritual for longer than I care to admit: summer weeks on the rocky coast of Maine. Much of the appeal, as with any tradition, is its changeless character. The precise times for high and low tides change each day, but in a predictable fashion. Although my children have grown from toddlers to adults - as old as I was when I first took them to Maine - the magical tide pools in which they used to splash are everlasting. The world might be going to hell, but summertime in Maine remains forever constant - "true north," both literally and metaphorically.  Until this summer.  Anticipation morphed into apprehension starting in March, when the local government of a Penobscot Bay island near my coastal cabin voted to ban all visitors, even seasonal residents who owned property there. The North Haven Select Board's order stated that "people who do not reside on the island full time may not travel to the island due to the significant increase in risk associated with the transmission of covid-19."  Although that order was soon rescinded, the governor declared that all out-of-state visitors would be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. Mainers' cordial, symbiotic relationship with so-called "summer people" now took on a wary, fearful tone. With my car's Virginia license plates, I might as well be Typhoid Mary.  Even getting to Maine would now prove daunting. Typically, I would take two days to drive from my year-round home in Virginia (often longer if caught in traffic turmoil around New York City or Boston). Spending the night somewhere new and different en route was part of the ritual, especially when the kids were young. So it was that we enjoyed leisurely and memorable hours at places like the historic Mohonk Mountain House in the Hudson River Valley and the Red Lion Inn in the Berkshires.  As with flying or...</description>

      <title>LINCOLN PROJECT plan for preserving union: Drive Trump out by driving him nuts...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/entertainment/article/The-Lincoln-Project-s-plan-for-preserving-the-15451080.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your house is on fire. Do you care who the firemen are?  That is a central question of the 2020 election. Donald Trump has managed to do one thing no other president has done: Bring Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and progressives, boomers and millennials together in unprecedented numbers to try to defeat him in November. For Americans who believe the president is a raging threat to democracy, purity tests are out. Results are in.  Which explains the spectacular rise of the Lincoln Project, a group of Republican Never Trumpers who have moved rent free into the president's head. Their viral videos and tweets mocking his leadership, his intelligence and his patriotism - aimed both at Republican voters who are waveringand Trump himself - have attracted millions of dollars, via donors from both parties. More than 10,000 people showed up for a virtual town hall last month. Lifelong Democrats are organizing fundraisers for the project.  The "Mourning in America" ad attacks Trump's mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak. "#TrumpIsNotWell" questions his mental and physical fitness. "Bounty" asks why Trump won't confront Vladimir Putin about U.S. intelligence reports that Russia offered bounties for the killing of American soldiers in Afghanistan.  The ads are slick, scathing and more shocking than anything Joe Biden's official campaign has produced. The newest release, "Wake Up," is a dark comic satire about a coma victim hearing about Trump's last three years. "Republicans, we need to wake up. This guy was in a coma. What's your excuse?"  "Donald Trump is so completely at odds with every institution in America and so completely at odds with anything that the Republican Party allegedly stood for: the rule of law, constitutional fealty, institutions, norms, traditions, all of those things are out the window," says...</description>
