      <title>Campaign reportedly ready to cancel convention rally...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/923605/trumps-campaign-reportedly-ready-cancel-convention-rally-avoid-tulsalike-humiliation</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poll after poll has shown former Vice President Joe Biden with a growing lead over President Trump, and with COVID-19 cases surging again, the president's approval level is sinking as well. It's all leading Trump to claim 'the polls are all fake' and, when he does believe them, beg for advice to turn it all around, Vanity Fair reports. In recent days, Trump has appeared 'down in the dumps,' Republicans who have spoken with him tell Vanity Fair. 'People around him think his heart's not in it,' one Republican close to the White House said of his campaign. Trump is reportedly stuck between appealing to his base and suburban voters, leading him to even call Fox News' Tucker Carlson last week and beg 'What do I do? What do I do?' In other instances, Trump has appeared in denial of his sputtering campaign and claimed 'the polls are all fake,' a Republican in touch with Trump tells Vanity Fair. But at other times he reportedly believes the polls â€” and blames them on his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner. But the reported blame games haven't stopped the bad news from pouring in, namely when it comes to the resumption of campaign rallies where Trump usually thrives. With coronavirus spreading throughout Florida and a mandatory mask policy now in place in Jacksonville, the Trump campaign is reportedly ready to cancel his 15,000-person rally at the Republican National Convention next month 'so that Trump doesnâ€™t suffer another Tulsaâ€“like humiliation,' Vanity Fair writes.

      <title>For TV networks missing sports, there's one unthinkable scenario: Losing NFL season...</title>
      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/For-TV-networks-missing-sports-there-s-one-15382020.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout the spring and into the summer - without the NBA playoffs and baseball's opening weeks - the sports world has continued to feel the steady drumbeat of the NFL. The league opened free agency as usual, providing news-making moments such as Tom Brady signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and then its April draft went off without a hitch, delivering boffo ratings for ESPN.  For the TV networks and sports media outlets that cover the league, this has been most welcome. But as the calendar flips to July, with NFL training camps set to open at the end of the month, doubts have surfaced about the viability of football season. Coronavirus cases are spiking in states across the country. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said football players may need to be in a bubble environment for the season to be played. Los Angeles Rams Coach Sean McVay wondered aloud how teams will be able to both play and take precautions.  "I mean, we're going to social distance, but we play football?" McVay said during a recent media appearance. "It's really hard for me to understand all this."  While there remains plenty of optimism the NFL will play - somehow, someway - networks are now fixated on the league's fall schedule, given its dominant position as America's most valuable television property. They are invested, of course, in the planned returns of Major League Baseball, the NBA and other sports, but none carry the importance of the NFL, which accounted for 41 of the top 50 rated telecasts of any kind in 2019. The lack of certainty has led to uncomfortable conversations among executives.  "It's practically the only thing on the minds of the networks," said John Kosner, a former ESPN executive who is now an industry consultant. "If you lost an NFL season, you're looking at a financial...</description>
