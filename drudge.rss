      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Behind-the-scenes-of-the-night-Trump-partied-at-14103852.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Donald Trump was coming off a bruising few years: His casino and real estate business had teetered on the edge of collapse, awash in debt. His marriage to Ivana Trump had disintegrated, and his relationship with model Marla Maples had fallen apart.  In November 1992, eager for a comeback, Trump threw a raucous party with NFL cheerleaders at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and invited NBC to tape the event.  Footage of that party, unearthed and aired by NBC News on Wednesday, shows Trump grabbing dancing cheerleaders and socializing with financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last week and charged with sex trafficking.  Trump has repeatedly said that he is "not a fan" of Epstein's and that the two had a falling out about 15 years ago. Epstein, who owns a home in Palm Beach near Mar-a-Lago, pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.  "I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him," the president said of Epstein this month. "He was a fixture in Palm Beach."  In the video from the 1992 party, the two men appear chummy, chuckling as Trump appears to point out women on the dance floor. At one point, Trump can be seen whispering in Epstein's ear, causing the financier to double over in laughter.  The footage was taken for a feature on Trump that aired on the NBC talk show "A Closer Look" that month. On the segment, host Faith Daniels described Trump's agreeing to come on the show after he kissed the news anchor on the lips in front of photographers at a charity dinner in New York while her husband's back was turned.  Trump's interactions with women at the Mar-a-Lago party - welcome or not - provides visual evidence of the kind of behavior he would later brag about on a 2005 "Access Hollywood" recording that surfaced at the end of the presidential...</description>

      <title>Barefoot woman scaled face of Mount Rushmore. She almost made it to top...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-barefoot-woman-scaled-the-face-of-Mount-14101788.php </link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;She clung to the sheer rock face barefoot with no safety ropes or climbing gear in sight. To her left, the enormous stone head of George Washington protruded from the side of the granite mountain. An equally impressive likeness of Thomas Jefferson boxed her in from the right. About 15 feet above her was the top of Mount Rushmore.  National Park Service officials said it was at this point that Alexandria Incontro finally stopped climbing last Friday when she illegally scaled the historic sculpture while visiting the monument in South Dakota with her family, according to federal court documents.  On Monday, the 30-year-old from Omaha, Nebraska, pleaded guilty to climbing Mount Rushmore, records said. She was fined $1,000 and given a $30 fee.  "Ms. Incontro seemed like a nice person who was 'having a day' as it were," her lawyer, Thomas Harmon, told The Washington Post in an email late Tuesday.  A Park Service representative did not respond to a request for comment late Tuesday.  The calls came pouring in shortly after 7 p.m. Friday, according to an incident report. A person had gone beyond the barrier intended to keep visitors away from the sculpture and past the bright orange warning signs, witnesses reported. The woman was starting to scramble up the massive pile of loose rocks at the base of the sculpture.  When a federal officer and park ranger arrived, the unruly visitor, later identified as Incontro, was already steadily ascending, the report said. The ranger told Incontro to come down and she responded by saying something like, "Do you want me to come down fast or slow?" She then kept climbing, officials said.  The officer and ranger followed Incontro, trailing behind her as she climbed higher and higher without shoes, gear or safety equipment, the documents said.  By...</description>
