      <title>Severed leg leads cops to cult's 'apostle'...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-severed-leg-led-police-to-a-Connecticut-cult-s-13125710.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The historic Shuttle Meadow Country Club in Kensington, Connecticut, sprawls over nearly 400 acres of land. Surrounded by dense forests and rolling hills, the club's picturesque 18-hole course is a golfer's dream. About 14 years ago, New Britain police made a grim discovery there. Responding to a report of human remains on Aug. 27, 2004, police arrived to find part of a leg, severed so cleanly that they could only come to one conclusion: someone had been killed. The source of the leg would remain a mystery until 2016, according to a recently released arrest warrant.</description>
