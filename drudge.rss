      <title>SURPRISES? UPSETS?</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/887461/joker-winning-best-picture-4-more-upsets-that-could-happen-2020-golden-globes</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could another evening of stunners be ahead at the 2020 Golden Globes? The yearly show honoring the best of television and film is notorious for its shock picks, which are made by the fewer than 100 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. This year, wins by movies from legendary filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino seem likely, but the Globes is anything but predictable. With that in mind, let's take a look at a few upsets that could be in the cards this Sunday. 1. Ramy Youssef for best actor in a comedy series - Pundits are generally predicting a Bill Hader, Ben Platt, or Paul Rudd win, but Vanity Fair thinks Ramy Youssef could surprise, noting the HFPA 'loves a chance to recognize fresh talent.' 2. The Morning Show for best drama series - A Succession win appears most likely, but might Apple TV+'s The Morning Show steal the Roy family's thunder? The Wrap suggests so, pointing out that the HFPA also loves tipping its hat to freshman series and 'their members are said to adore' this one. 3. Antonio Banderas for best actor in a drama film - This category is thought to be a race between Adam Driver and Joaquin Phoenix â€” but Vanity Fair suggests Antonio Banderas could be a dark horse contender. 4. Ana de Armas for best actress in a comedy or musical film - Awkwafina is the frontrunner, but the HFPA gave Knives Out more love than expected with three nominations, and Gold Derby writes prognosticators 'might be underestimating' star Ana de Armas. 5. Joker for best drama film - After last year's Bohemian Rhapsody, pundits are bracing for another jaw-dropper in this category, in which The Irishman seems like something of a lock. Could Joker's Todd Phillips earning a surprise Best Director nomination indicate the HFPA is more enthusiastic about his film than many realize? The New York Times' Kyle Buchanan believes this could be the 'shock of the night.' Brendan Morrow</description>

      <title>Trump thought war with Iran could help Obama reelection. What about his own?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Trump-thought-war-with-Iran-could-help-reelect-14949215.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The president who once mused about a president attacking Iran to win reelection has now inched closer to war with Iran - in his own reelection year.  But if President Donald Trump truly thinks a new war in the Middle East might help him win, he might want to think again.  Ever since the controversial decision to kill a high-ranking Iranian military official in Baghdad on Thursday, Trump's critics have pointed anxiously to his past commentary on the politics of war with Iran. Trump repeatedly in 2011 and 2012 predicted Barack Obama would attack Iran because it was the only way he would be reelected. Trump was doubly wrong: The attack never came, and Obama won comfortably anyway.  But as he confronts his own difficult reelection math and a standoff with Iran, it's worth considering whether Trump might be making a similar calculation for himself - however cynical that thought might be.  What we can say at this point: There's little reason to believe it would help.  Pollsters and political analysts often talk about a "rally around the flag" effect that comes when the United States is attacked or launches new military campaigns. And there is something to that. But it's often quite short-lived, and there's little evidence it has actually helped any recent president win reelection.  The most recent example would be the Iraq War, which George W. Bush launched in March 2003. According to Gallup data, his approval rating increased from 58 percent just before the invasion to 71 percent immediately afterward. But it was back to 58 percent just four months later, and despite the capture of Saddam Hussein in late 2003, on the eve of the 2004 election it stood at 48 percent.  Approval of the war was middling by then, with exit polls showing 51 percent approved of the decision to go to...</description>

      <title>Venezuela opposition -- and Guaido -- face critical test in vote...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Venezuela-s-opposition-and-Juan-Guaid-face-a-14949403.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CARACAS, Venezuela - Venezuela's opposition faces a critical test on Sunday, when its leader, Juan Guaidó, will seek reelection as head of the National Assembly - a title that forms the basis of his recognition as Venezuela's true head of state by nearly 60 countries around the globe.  For Guaidó, the vote amounts to a do-or-die moment. One year ago, he declared President Nicolás Maduro a usurper for claiming victory in tainted elections and declared himself Venezuela's rightful leader - an assertion based on Guaidó's status as head of the assembly. But after a year of failed attempts to oust Maduro, Guaidó is now struggling to maintain opposition unity, confronting flagging domestic support and scrambling to counter an alleged plot against him.  Maduro's socialist government has sought to thwart Guaidó's reelection by allegedly bribing and intimidating lawmakers to turn against him. Should enough of them abandon Guaidó on Sunday, the Washington-backed 36-year-old would no longer be able to defend his presidential claim as being rooted in the Venezuelan constitution.  "It would create an international disruption and put us in a very critical situation," said Luis Stefanelli, a Venezuelan lawmaker now living in exile in the United States. "We need Guaidó there. The government knows it."  Discovery of the alleged plot last month, Guaidó loyalists say, has helped them to counter it. And they are cautiously optimistic about Guaidó's reelection. In an effort designed to enhance his chances, U.S. officials in recent weeks have privately reiterated their support of Guaidó to major players within the Venezuelan opposition, according to three people familiar with the effort.  In addition, opposition officials have authorized pro-Guaidó lawmakers in exile to vote remotely on Sunday, ensuring a larger pool of votes and...</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/With-missile-strike-Trump-opts-for-escalation-14948664.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a conflict known for extremes of rhetoric - the "Great Satan" and the "Axis of Evil" - the four-decade rivalry between the United States and Iran has been largely defined by calculation and restraint. The two countries bloodied one another using covert operatives and proxies, but mostly refrained from directly targeting each other's citizens or troops.  That record ended abruptly late Thursday when a U.S. missile slammed into a small convoy near Baghdad International Airport. The explosion instantly killed Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the powerful and ruthless commander of Iran's elite Quds Force. It also shattered what had been a tenet of U.S. policy for Republican and Democratic administrations: a careful avoidance of the kinds of direct confrontations that might escalate into war with Iran.  Trump administration officials described the fiery attack as a defensive measure intended to disrupt Iranian plans to kill U.S. diplomats or service members overseas. But current and former U.S. officials said the United States almost certainly will face retaliatory strikes for the killing of Soleimani, as well as a heightened risk of a wider regional conflict, which U.S. administrations previously had sought to avoid.  "It's like hitting a hornets' nest with a baseball bat," said Robert Baer, a former CIA case officer in the Middle East and veteran of clandestine operations. "You don't do it unless you're ready to go to war with the hornets."  Defenders of Thursday's action say the strike delivered a long-overdue response to Iran's increasingly malign behavior in the region, which has included support for rocket and missile strikes by pro-Iranian militias targeting U.S. military bases, international shipping and oil installations in the Persian Gulf.  But Iran experts say the killing of Soleimani - a legendary military leader...</description>
