      <title>DESANTIS: If Biden Keeps Sending Illegals, 'I Will Send Them To Delaware'...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) on Wednesday commented on the Biden administration sending illegal immigrants from the border to Florida. "The President has said that basically, they want to even pay reparations to people who came illegally, just think about that," DeSantis said. "You as an American, you get higher gas prices, you get higher grocery bills, you get told basically, to just grin and bear it, someone breaks the law, comes illegally, and they're going to cut him a check for hundreds of thousands of dollars. That is just unbelievable. But that's what we're dealing with." "My view would be, why don't we, if they're going to come here, you know, we'll provide buses," he said. "I will send them to Delaware and do that. I mean, if he's not going to support the border being secured, then he should be able to have everyone there. So, we will do whatever we can in that regard. And we are absolutely going to do everything we can."</description>
