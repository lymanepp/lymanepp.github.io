      <title>Baristas beware: Robot that makes gourmet cups of coffee has arrived...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Baristas-beware-A-robot-that-makes-gourmet-cups-13708775.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the food industry, it seems, the robot revolution is well underway, with machines mastering skilled tasks that have always been performed by people.  In Boston, robots have replaced chefs and are creating complex bowls of food for customers. In Prague, machines are displacing bartenders and servers using an app. In Denver, they're taking orders at a fast food drive through.  Robots are even making the perfect loaf of bread these days, taking charge of an art that has remained in human hands for thousands of years.  Now comes Briggo, a company that has created a fully automated, robotic brewing machine that that can push out 100 cups of coffee in a single hour -- equaling the output of three to four baristas, according to the company.  Using a blend of Latin American beans, the machine -- known as a "coffee haus" -- creates customized cups of gourmet coffee that can be ordered via an app, giving customers control over ingredients, espresso shots, flavorings and temperature without any human interaction. The company says no other business in the world has applied as much technology to "specialty coffee."  Removing the human element from ordering a cup of coffee is one of the company's primary selling points.  "No more lines, no more counter confusion, no more misspelled names," Briggo's website says, flicking at human failings.  Briggo said all eight of its machines are owned by the company, but they've recently begun offering a licensed business model to prospective operators. The company didn't reveal how much that business model costs, but noted that rent and revenue-sharing arrangements are typical when a machine is placed in a public location, such as an airport.  Kevin Nater, Briggo's president and chief executive, said the machine would thrive in locations in which...</description>
