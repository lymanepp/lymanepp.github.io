      <title>Tests Barr with more tweets...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-fires-off-more-tweets-about-Justice-15067614.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump continued to test his relationship with Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday by amplifying conservative allies demanding he "clean house" at the Justice Department and target those involved in the Russia investigation that once threatened his presidency.  The grievances shared by Trump in a flurry of morning tweets included claims of a "seditious conspiracy" against him, and attacks on a "criminal gang" at the FBI and Justice Department.  A day after it was revealed that Barr told people close to Trump he had considered quitting, the president and his attorney general seemed to reach a detente of sorts. Officials inside the Justice Department said they were watching the situation closely, mindful that a new string of tweets or comments could quickly upend the situation, but there were no indications that Barr would leave imminently. The attorney general did not mention the controversy when he spoke during an event at FBI headquarters Wednesday.  The fragile equilibrium may be tested again Thursday, when Trump's longtime friend Roger Stone is scheduled to be sentenced for lying to Congress and obstruction. Trump's tweets about Stone last week prompted Barr to speak out publicly, saying the president's declarations "make it impossible for me to do my job."  If Trump continues to tweet, and Barr continues to stay in his job, "I think he is in danger of getting into 'Boy Who Cried Wolf' territory," said Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman in the Obama administration. "He's already said the president's commenting made his job impossible, and the president kept commenting, and then he apparently told people that he was considering resigning if the president didn't stop. So if the president doesn't stop now and he doesn't quit, he looks feckless and insincere."  In the...</description>

      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Barr-has-told-those-close-to-Trump-that-he-may-15066320.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Attorney General William Barr has told people close to President Donald Trump - inside and outside the White House - that he is considering quitting over Trump's tweets about Justice Department investigations, three administration officials said, foreshadowing a possible confrontation between the president and his attorney general over the independence of the Justice Department.  So far, Trump has defied Barr's requests, both public and private, to keep quiet on matters of federal law enforcement. It was not immediately clear Tuesday whether Barr had made his posture known directly to Trump. The administration officials said Barr seemed to be sharing his position with advisers in hopes that the president would get the message that he should stop weighing in publicly on the Justice Department's ongoing criminal investigations.  "He has his limits," said one person familiar with Barr's thinking, speaking on the condition of anonymity, like others, to discuss internal deliberations.  Late last week, Barr publicly warned the president in a remarkable interview with ABC News that his tweets about Justice Department cases "make it impossible for me to do my job." Trump, White House officials said, is not entirely receptive to calls to change his behavior, and he has told those around him he is not going to stop tweeting about the Justice Department. They said Trump sees highlighting FBI and Justice Department misconduct as a good political message.  The standoff between Trump and Barr intensified Tuesday, when Trump declared in a string of early morning tweets that he might sue those involved in the special counsel's investigation into his 2016 campaign and suggested that Roger Stone, his friend convicted of lying to Congress in that probe, deserved a new trial.  Hours later, a Justice Department official revealed...</description>

      <title>Has constitutional power to intervene in Roger Stone's case... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/opinion/article/Trump-has-the-constitutional-power-to-intervene-15067530.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump tweeted last week that he has the "legal right" to tell Attorney General William Barr how to handle Roger Stone's prosecution - bringing the fury of the legal establishment down on him. Federal prosecutors had recommended a seven-to-nine-year sentence for Stone, who was convicted of perjury and witness tampering. Trump tweeted that the recommendation was "horrible and very unfair." Subsequently, the Justice Department dropped the recommendation.  More than 2,000 former Justice Department employees promptly declared in an open letter that they "condemn" Trump and Barr's "interference in the fair administration of justice." Donald Ayer, who served as deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, wrote in the Atlantic magazine of Barr's complicity in the sentencing shift: "Given our national faith and trust in a rule of law no one can subvert, it is not too strong to say that Bill Barr is un-American."  Un-American? Absolutely not. Unconstitutional? Not even close. Unwise? Yes. As a policy matter, the president should stay out of sentencing decisions, especially those involving his friends. But the president is correct that he has the legal authority to intervene in the case. The Constitution does not create a wall of separation between the president and the Justice Department. To the contrary, the Constitution vests the "executive power" in the president. And the decision whether and how to prosecute someone ultimately belongs to the president.  Article II of the Constitution establishes a single president, and all of the executive powers belong to that elected official. As a practical matter, the president delegates some of those powers to the Justice Department - specifically, prosecutorial discretion for criminal matters. But if the president chooses to intervene, the attorney...</description>
