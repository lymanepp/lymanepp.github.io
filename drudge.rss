      <title>Pentagon warns of 'false alarm' nuke launches...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/928200/pentagon-wants-new-nuke-because-might-fire-old-ones-by-mistake</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Defense Department and the Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration in May argued in a previously undisclosed memo to Congress that the United States needs a new, more powerful nuclear warhead program because of risks and vulnerabilities in the current one, Roll Call reports. The argument is 'groundbreaking,' per Roll Call, because the government rarely, if ever, acknowledges the arsenal's weaknesses. Among the issues the departments address in the 'closely held' document are what they consider to be an over-reliance on one type of submarine-launched warhead that apparently isn't destructive enough and could suffer from technical problems, as well concerns about land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles that are set in a 'launch under attack posture.' That means the weapons are ready to launch within minutes of a reported enemy attack, which increases the risk of firing in the wake of a false alarm. And when ICBMS are launched, they cannot be returned to their silos. The Pentagon usually downplays the possibility of reacting to a false report, Roll Call reports, but the memo uses it to justify a new weapon that supposedly wouldn't carry the same risks. Critics think developing the new sub-launched weapon, known as a W93, is unnecessary (they believe the current warheads are plenty forceful), too expensive, and could harm global non-proliferation efforts. It remains to be seen if the Pentagon and the NNSA will be able to convince Congress and whoever wins the 2020 presidential election with their arguments, but the debate will likely gain more attention going forward. Read more at Roll Call. Tim O'Donnell Whatever one thinks of the administration's arguments, they are extraordinary &amp; groundbreaking. This new weapon has received scant public debate. Just $53 million is on the line this year for design work. But after that, this will become a bigger issue in Washington. / END â€” John M. Donnelly (@johnmdonnelly) July 29, 2020</description>

      <title>Michelle O podcast sounds suspiciously like stump speech...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/928117/michelle-obamas-podcast-sounds-suspiciously-like-stump-speech</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former first lady Michelle Obama has officially joined the ranks of Snooki, Snoop Dogg, and your old college roommate by starting her own podcast. In a sense, The Michelle Obama Podcast was inevitable: the Obamas pivoted from being politicians to celebrities after leaving the White House, and a requirement of being a famous person in 2020 is talking into a microphone for fans who may or may not exist. Since handing over the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to the Trumps, the Obamas have fully embraced their celebrity status, signing a $65 million joint book deal, landing a massive, multi-year producing gig with Netflix, and, most recently, booking Obama's podcast (Spotify, which has the exclusive, inked similar deals around the same time with Kim Kardashian West, Joe Rogan, and DC Comics). Though Michelle Obama isn't hawking vagina candles or posting FabFitFun sponcon on Instagram, the Obamas aren't exactly following the Jimmy Carter model of living modestly while quietly building thousands of homes for Habitat for Humanity, either. Perhaps most frustrating for their supporters, the couple's pivot into celebritydom has seemed accompanied by a reluctance to speak out about politics in any meaningful way. The debut episode of the podcast, though, also highlights Michelle's innate gift for spinning her biography into political issues and advocacy â€” a talent that is hard to come by (Hillary Clinton struggled with it) but practically a golden ticket for a politician. Obama, for example, discusses her Leave It to Beaver-esque childhood, smoothly evoking the unifying vision her husband sold: 'You are guided by the principle that we are each other's brother's and sister's keepers,' Michelle tells Barack. 'And that's how I was raised!' Obama says her podcast is intended to explore 'relationships' by digging into her own. But it quickly becomes clear that there's a bigger picture: 'We weren't built to do this thing called life in a vacuum. It is much more hopeful, it is much more gratifying, much more effective to live this life as a 'we,'' she stresses. It's a good line â€” she should have saved it for the convention speech.

      <title>Latest trend among wealthy American travelers? Buying another country's citizenship...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/lifestyle/article/The-latest-trend-among-wealthy-American-15442479.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For generations, the American passport afforded its holders the privilege of hassle-free travel around much of the world. That has changed with the coronavirus pandemic. While borders are beginning to reopen to international travel, some countries are staying closed to Americans because of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak stateside.  These travel restrictions are producing an emerging trend among some wealthy Americans: buying a second passport.  "This limitation of mobility has made more people aware of ... the benefits of having more than one passport," said Armand Arton, the president of financial firm Arton Capital, which specializes in citizenship through investment.  The firm defines citizenship by investment as "the process of obtaining a second citizenship and passport by investing in the economy of the host country." These investments can come in the form of real estate, bonds or various new business ventures.  Arton says his firm has seen a 30 to 40 percent increase, year to date, in demand for services that help clients obtain citizenship in a sovereign state through financial means. The price tag for these services varies, ranging from $100,000 for some Caribbean options to more than $2 million for European ones.  Before the coronavirus, the plan mainly appealed to Americans for tax purposes, Arton says. But mid-pandemic, motivations have shifted. Some of Arton Capital's American clients are in mixed-nationality relationships where couples have been separated because of pandemic travel bans. Others are worried about the impact of U.S. politics on their passport's global standing.  "We've had Americans contacting us and saying, 'Listen, I cannot believe that my American super passport cannot get me into as many countries as it used to before. What can I do?' " Arton says. "That was never the case for us...</description>

      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/A-coronavirus-comeback-around-the-world-15442064.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIRUT - An unforeseen summer surge of coronavirus cases in countries that had seemingly quelled their outbreaks is helping to drive the unrelenting growth of the global pandemic, undercutting predictions that a "second wave" would not occur until the fall.  Japan, Israel, Lebanon and Hong Kong are among dozens of places reporting record numbers of new cases in recent days, many weeks after they had crushed the curve of infections, reopened their economies and moved on.  And in some countries that had brought numbers down, notably in Europe, the reopening of borders, bars and nightclubs is being blamed for a small but noticeable increase in cases.  In Belgium and Spain, the number of daily infections has surpassed levels not seen since early May, prompting authorities to reimpose some recently lifted restrictions.  "I'm afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Tuesday, referring to Europe, as he sought to justify reimposing quarantine measures on travelers from Spain. Britain also is seeing more cases.  The United States, Brazil and India are still fueling the bulk of the pandemic's growth, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the new cases reported globally over the past week. Many other countries, including in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, have not yet reached a peak in infections, officials at the World Health Organization say.  Most places experiencing new waves of coronavirus cases still lag far behind the United States, Brazil and some other parts of the world in per capita rates of infection. Japan, for instance, has only around 230 infections per 1 million people, compared with more than 13,000 infections per 1 million people in the United States.  But since the...</description>
