      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ESTACADA, Ore. - Justice is an 8-year-old American quarter horse who used to be named Shadow. And when he was named Shadow, he suffered. At a veterinarian's exam last year, he was 300 pounds underweight, his black coat lice-ridden, his skin scabbed and his genitals so frostbitten that they might still require amputation. The horse had been left outside and underfed by his previous owner, who last summer pleaded guilty to criminal neglect. And now Justice, who today resides with other rescued equines on a quiet wooded farm within view of Oregon's Cascade mountains, is suing his former owner for negligence.</description>

Eric Swalwell is laying the tracks for a possible 2020 presidential run. “Yes, I am considering running,” Swalwell said in a matter-of-fact way when we caught up with him at a recent National Night Out block party in San Lorenzo, where he was mixing with constituents.
