      <title>Leaking classified information is 'thievery, not protected speech,' Justice Dept says... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Leaking-classified-information-is-thievery-not-14484074.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALEXANDRIA, Va. - A contractor accused of leaking classified information engaged in "thievery, not protected speech," and has no First Amendment grounds to challenge his Espionage Act prosecutions, the Justice Department said in an Alexandria federal court filing.  Former intelligence analyst Daniel Hale shared National Security Agency details of drone warfare with the website The Intercept, according to an indictment filed in May. His defense attorneys argued last month that the law was designed to deal with spies, not leakers, and that the prosecution runs afoul of the First Amendment by chilling newsgathering and implicating the reporter who received the information.  It's an argument that probably will resurface if Julian Assange, facing prosecution in the same courthouse for publishing classified information, is ever extradited. The government rarely prosecuted leakers until President Barack Obama's tenure, and the Trump administration is the first president to prosecute the publisher of classified information along with the leaker.  Prosecutors pushed back in their own motion Monday, saying Hale signed nondisclosure agreements that made the law clear.  "Hale expressly waived in writing his right to disclose the national security information he obtained while in his government position," Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Berrang wrote.  Whether Congress intended the Espionage Act to cover leaks when the law was drafted during World War I, Berrang says, "may be interesting thought exercises but are irrelevant to the case at hand."  He also called it "dubious" to suggest there should be any legal distinction between leakers and spies.  "While spies typically pass classified national defense information to a specific foreign government, leakers, through the internet,...</description>

      <title>Any challenge to his presidency is attack on America... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/In-Trump-s-telling-a-challenge-to-his-presidency-14484365.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - For President Donald Trump, the impeachment case being built by Democrats over his alleged effort to recruit foreign help for his reelection effort isn't just a "WITCH HUNT," though he calls it that, too; it's "treason." It isn't just "presidential harassment," though he also makes that charge; it's an invitation to "Civil War."  The president is bringing the rhetorical heavy artillery to the most serious challenge to his presidency in nearly three tumultuous, norm-busting, warp-speed years in office.  Expanding on the lexicon of outrage and victimhood honed during the probe into Russian interference in the last election, Trump is invoking the muskets-and-ramparts idioms of the country's beginnings.  The ratcheting up of his rhetoric is also indicative of Trump's tendency to interpret any criticism of him as an attack on the government, worrying critics and scholars who warn of the dangers posed by his l'état, c'est moi call to arms.  "Charging anyone with treason is a most unusual act in American history. It's an incendiary charge which relates to the ultimate crime: overthrow of the state," said Michael Glennon, an international law professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.  In setting out a definition and consequences for treason in the Constitution, including death, the Founders were guarding against the "danger that the charge of treason could be made irresponsibly against political opponents," he said, adding that cavalierly throwing around words like treason and civil war belies their unique meaning in American history.  "I suppose it has an incendiary effect on some supporters, but we are dealing with dynamite here," Glennon said.  Trump has focused his most pointed comments on Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and chairman of the...</description>

      <title>Can posture devices pull you out of constant slump?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/article/Can-these-posture-devices-pull-you-out-of-your-14482655.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like a lot of people, I spend much of my workday staring at various screens - and, like a lot of people, I have the back and neck issues to prove it. Hunching and its associated symptoms are a hallmark of the digital age. Though I have a makeshift ergonomic setup in my home office, I often catch myself with my chin jutting forward as I lean toward my laptop - despite the fact that I'm a regular Pilates student and former yoga teacher.  Clearly, my athletic training hasn't done enough to reinforce good habits. So, searching for a path to better posture, I spoke with two doctors about the problem and tried a few gadgets that promised to help me straighten things out.  "We get into this stooped posture to get our faces close to the screen, which puts a lot of unnatural stress on the cervical spine," says Kaliq Chang, a double board-certified physician in interventional pain management and anesthesiology with Atlantic Spine Center in West Orange, New Jersey. Ideally, when you're sitting at your desk in front of a computer monitor, "You're meant to have the weight of your head situated over your neck in a manner that forces your chest out and your shoulders back, which requires having a monitor close to eye level," Chang says.  When you hunch forward, whether at your desk or looking at your phone on the couch, the muscles in your neck and back extend while the ones in the front contract; over time, this can create an imbalance where they pull on one another unevenly. The effect would be minimal if we were only putting our necks and backs in awkward positions for minutes at a time, but people often spend hours out of whack.  "That's where the problem lies," says Charla Fischer, an orthopedic surgeon at New York University's Langone Spine Center. When muscles are stretched in uncomfortable ways for prolonged periods of time,...</description>
