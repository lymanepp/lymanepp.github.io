      <title>COVER-UP FEARS MOUNTING</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Wuhan-quarantine-expands-as-Chinese-fear-14997682.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIJING - The central Chinese city of Wuhan pulsated with fear and anger Thursday, as 11 million people awoke to news that they were being confined to a metropolis-sized quarantine zone designed to contain a widening coronavirus outbreak.  The quarantine is also spreading with nearby Huanggang and Ezhou announcing they were shutting down travel networks, effectively confining some 20 million people to their municipalities.  In Wuhan, train and bus stations were abruptly closed, hundreds of flights were canceled, and some roads were blocked to stop people from leaving the city Thursday, a day when transportation networks should have been heaving with passengers heading to their hometowns for the official start of the Lunar New Year holiday on Friday night.  But experts warned that it would not be enough to stop the spread of the pneumonia-like virus, which has now killed 17 people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. The number of people infected in China stood at 617 on Thursday afternoon.  "A bigger outbreak is certain," said Guan Yi, a virologist who helped identify Severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. He estimated - "conservatively" - that this outbreak could be 10 times bigger than the SARS epidemic because that virus was transmitted by only a few "super spreaders" in a more defined part of the country.  "We have passed through the 'golden period' for prevention and control," he told Caixin magazine from self-imposed quarantine after visiting Wuhan. "What's more, we've got the holiday traffic rush and a dereliction of duty from certain officials."  Authorities had initially said that the virus, which began in a Wuhan food market selling exotic animals for consumption, was mild and could not be transmitted between humans. But that changed this week when the numbers of people infected by the virus, which has...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite a lineup of in-demand performers including Ariana Grande, Rosalía, Lizzo and pop-goth wunderkind Billie Eilish, the upcoming Grammy Awards will, for the third time in as many years, take place amid turmoil within its ranks.  Last week, the Recording Academy, which puts on the annual ceremony, announced that its chief executive Deborah Dugan had been placed on administrative leave following a "formal allegation of misconduct by a senior female member" of the organization. Dugan's suspension arrived less than six months into her tenure as the academy's first female chief executive and president - and just days ahead of the Jan. 26 ceremony.  Dugan responded Tuesday in a 44-page complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging gender discrimination, sexual harassment and unequal pay on the part of the academy. The complaint, officially known as a charge of discrimination, also claims that the organization retaliated against Dugan after she raised concerns - in an email to a senior human resources executive - that the academy was operating under a "'boys' club' mentality."  In her email, Dugan accused Joel Katz, an entertainment lawyer who serves as the academy's general counsel, of sexually harassing her. She also referenced alleged sexual misconduct by her predecessor, Neil Portnow, who called the allegations "ludicrous, and untrue" in a statement to media outlets Wednesday.  Dugan's lawsuit signals a reckoning for the embattled 63-year-old organization, which has faced mounting criticism in recent years over the Grammys' failure to properly recognize female artists and artists of color. Here are some answers to questions you might have about the lawsuit - and how it might affect the Grammys going forward.  - When did the controversy start?  According to Dugan's lawsuit, she emailed the...</description>

      <title>Jury hears defense cite accuser's email saying 'I love you' years after alleged rape...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Harvey-Weinstein-used-his-power-and-prestige-to-14995261.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK - Women accusing Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault at his criminal trial will have to answer for two realities - the stories they will tell on the witness stand and the starkly different record preserved in emails and other records from before and after the alleged assaults.  That was the argument made by his attorney Damon Cheronis on Wednesday as he presented to the jury emails between Weinstein and the woman he allegedly raped at a Doubletree Hotel in Manhattan in 2013.  Cheronis said accuser Jessica Mann, an aspiring actress, maintained a five-year relationship with the movie tycoon and sent flirty, warm messages throughout. At one point she referred to him as her "casual boyfriend."  "I love you, I always do. But I hate feeling like a booty call. ;)" Mann wrote in a 2017 message to Weinstein - which was put up on a large TV screen at the back of the room in Cheronis' opening statement.  "Ladies and gentlemen, that's not how you talk to your predator," the lawyer said. "That's not how you talk to your rapist."  Cheronis said the district attorney's office wants to convey that the women were "weak" and "couldn't stand up for themselves," that they "were lured in by Harvey Weinstein [and] tricked."  "That's a mirage, and don't take my word for it," the lawyer told the jury.  Weinstein was hunched over at the defense table during his lawyer's moment in the spotlight, chewing his way through a roll of Mentos as Cheronis offered the first official counternarrative to the depiction of Weinstein as a monster and predator that has taken hold in the media since allegations against him started the #MeToo movement in October 2017.  "The truth doesn't change when an article comes out in 2017," Cheronis told the panel, referring to some of the coverage that prompted scores...</description>
