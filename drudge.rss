      <title>After early virus warning, 10 days of distraction...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/After-early-virus-warning-10-days-of-distraction-15573335.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - In explaining why he repeatedly misled the American public about the early dangers posed by the novel coronavirus, President Donald Trump has argued that he did not want to engender panic - and suggested that his actions showed he took the looming pandemic seriously.  But a detailed review of the 10-day period from late January, when Trump was first warned about the scale of the threat, and early February - when he acknowledged to author Bob Woodward the extent of the danger the virus posed - reveals a president who took relatively few serious measures to ready the nation for its arrival.  Instead, enabled by top administration officials, Trump largely attempted to pretend the virus did not exist - spending much of his time distracted by impeachment and exacting vengeance on his political enemies. He also carried on as usual with showy political gatherings and crowded White House events.  The period would presage Trump's disjointed and often dismissive approach to the virus in the months to come, as the president and his aides repeatedly sought to diminish the danger of a pandemic that has now claimed nearly 200,000 American lives while leaving millions more infected or out of work. Trump and White House officials disagree, arguing that the president took definitive steps in the early days of the virus that showed his resolve and helped limit the death toll.  Joe Grogan, former head of the Domestic Policy Council, said that the analyses now, more than half a year later, are "all ex post facto about where this was going to go." Grogan said Trump was "focused on the issue but getting frustrated with others internally who were panicking about it because they were raising their voices and being hyperbolic."  "The president didn't want to panic people," Grogan said. "Taking a step back, messaging was a challenge....</description>

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Barr-issues-blistering-critique-of-his-own-15573598.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attorney General William Barr delivered a scathing critique of his own Justice Department on Wednesday night, insisting on his absolute authority to overrule career staff, whom he said too often injected themselves into politics and went "headhunting" for high profile targets.  Speaking at an event hosted by Hillsdale College, a school with deep ties to conservative politics, Barr directly addressed the criticism that has been building for months inside the department toward his heavy hand in politically sensitive cases, particularly those involving associates of President Donald Trump.  "What exactly am I interfering with?" he asked. "Under the law, all prosecutorial power is invested in the attorney general."  Barr's comments were remarkable, in that the head of the Justice Department catalogued all of the ways in which he thought his agency had gone astray over the years, and in its current formulation harms the body politic. Barr has drawn considerable criticism for intervening in criminal cases in ways that help benefit the president's friends.  Barr said it was he, not career officials, who have the ultimate authority to decide how cases should be handled, and derided less-experienced, less-senior bureaucrats who current and former prosecutors have long insisted should be left to handle their cases free from interference from political appointees.  Barr said that argument, in essence, means "the will of the most junior member of the organization" would make decisions, but he insisted he would not "blindly" defer to "whatever those subordinates want to do."  "Letting the most junior members set the agenda might be a good philosophy for a Montessori preschool, but it is no way to run a federal agency," Barr said.  The attorney general, the nation's top law enforcement...</description>

      <title>CDC creating wastewater surveillance system...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/937817/cdc-working-create-covid19-wastewater-surveillance-system-sewage-samples-prove-effective</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Testing wastewater for a deadly virus isn't new — it has been used to identify polio outbreaks — but the idea has gained traction as cities and universities look for ways to plod toward normalcy as the world awaits a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Universities have had great success monitoring for COVID-19 flare-ups by testing wastewater, or 'all the dirty stuff from the toilets, showers, sinks, washing machines, dishwashers, you name it,' Politico reports. And now 'the CDC and HHS are working on a national wastewater surveillance system and data portal' for willing states and local governments. People shed the coronavirus in their waste days before they show signs of illness, so finding COVID-19 in wastewater can give authorities 'seven precious days for intervention,' said Ian Pepper at the University of Arizona. His team tested the wastewater outside dorms every morning, but monitoring samples of sewage in Baton Rouge predicted an outbreak two weeks after Louisiana's governor lifted restrictions — then tracked the sharp decline in infections after the governor started requiring people to wear masks. Setting up a nationwide wastewater surveillance system early in the pandemic would have helped alert officials before an outbreak took hold, says David Larsen, an epidemiologist and public health expert at Syracuse University, one of the schools that tests wastewater. 'My kids would be in school right now. Our economy would not have tanked the way that it has.' And testing every U.S. ZIP code twice a week would cost about $3 billion a year, Larsen estimates. 'It's really not much. The cost per person monitored is like $10, if that, a year.' The payoff, he said, is it 'would be huge to get us back to work' for the year before a vaccine becomes widely available. Peter Weber</description>

      <title>In Denmark, forest the new classroom...</title>
      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/In-Denmark-the-forest-is-the-new-classroom-15570973.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAMSO, Denmark - On a balmy Monday afternoon earlier this month, Sebastian Lukas, 27, watched from across a clearing as his third- and fourth-grade students whittled branches into spearheads with sharp knives.  His gaze turned to another group, who were supposed to be working on math problems. Two students, perched on a log, scrambled to produce their textbooks, just in time to look busy.  Lukas began the year teaching in a classroom like any other, in Samso Frie Skole, a school on the Danish island of Samso. But when the novel coronavirus pandemic struck, the school, like many across the country, embraced a new way to hold certain classes: almost entirely outdoors.  Instead of sitting at desks, Lukas's students wander through a rambling woodland, lush with trees and crisscrossed by dirt tracks.  As countries grapple with how and when to restore students to classrooms, a growing number of schools have embraced outdoor learning - especially in the highly regarded Nordic education systems, where the model had already begun to gain momentum.  When many Danish schools reopened in April, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged teachers to allow for as much time outdoors as possible, as a precaution against the spread of the virus. In Norway, education and health officials also recommended that classes meet outside.  Out of nearly 200 Norwegian schools willing to respond to a recent survey by researchers Ulrich Dettweiler and Gabriele Lauterbach, the results of which have not yet been published, more than half said they had begun to provide more outdoor classes. Researchers in Denmark said they had observed a similar trend.  Some countries, including Germany, have a tradition of outdoor preschools and kindergartens, which have begun to catch on in the United States as well. The...</description>

      <title>The Senate seats most likely to flip...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/The-Senate-seats-most-likely-to-flip-in-November-15570881.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Republicans have a slim, three-seat majority in the Senate that they're trying to hold on to in November. And they are in for a battle to do it: There are 13 chances on this list for Democrats to flip Senate seats and just two for Republicans.  But Republican strategists say they're seeing evidence that Republican-leaning voters turned off by President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus are starting to come home to the party in the final stretch, and they think it might be enough for some of these vulnerable Republican senators to hang on and deny Democrats the majority.  Democrats' path to the majority is to net at least four Senate seats or net three and win the White House to get the majority, but that requires going through some Republican-leaning states.  For now, the most competitive races remain largely unchanged from our last rankings in August. We'll update these rankings again between now and November.  Because so many of the races could go either way - while others are more of a stretch - we divided them in three categories: More likely to flip than not, toss-ups, and could flip under the right conditions.  - More likely to flip than not: Alabama, Colorado and Arizona.  1. Alabama (Democrat-held): Democratic Sen. Doug Jones remains the most vulnerable senator in 2020. He's facing former Auburn University coach Tommy Tuberville, a first-time candidate that Democrats are modestly optimistic could stumble in the spotlight. But no one with a stake is arguing that a Senate race in one of the most pro-Trump states in the country is a toss-up.  2. Colorado (Republican-held): Republican Sen. Cory Gardner is trying to pull away from Trump in this purple-blue state by talking about an outdoors conservation bill he wrote, rather than how he voted to...</description>

      <title>China's third aircraft carrier takes shape, with ambitions to challenge U.S. dominance...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/China-s-third-aircraft-carrier-takes-shape-with-15570885.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TAIPEI, Taiwan - Shipbuilders in Shanghai have laid out the hull of China's first modern aircraft carrier, which could be launched into the water in the coming months as it enters the latter phases of construction, according to new satellite images and state media reports.  High-resolution photos recently obtained by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a non-partisan think tank in Washington, show for the first time sections of the carrier being assembled in the open at a dry dock at the sprawling Jiangnan shipyard. The vessel, which will be China's third carrier but the first to be equipped with modern technology, is likely to be larger than the previous two that were based on outdated Soviet designs. At the waterline, the new ship will be about 1,000 feet long and 130 feet wide, the photos show.  Matthew Funaiole, a researcher at the CSIS ChinaPower project, said it is not yet clear from the images whether the new carrier will have an electromagnetic catapult to efficiently sling fighter jets off its deck - the biggest question mark over current Chinese carrier technology. The USS Gerald R. Ford, commissioned in 2017, was the first carrier to include the cutting-edge feature.  Still, "the Chinese are showing tremendous capability of designing and fitting out vessels," Funaiole said. "It's moving along on pace. It's impressive the process they're going through to position themselves at the forefront of carrier technology."  The progress of China's third carrier has been of intense interest in rival capitals as well as inside China, where it is seen as a tangible symbol of the country's development into a global power boasting a modern, world-class military. China has commissioned two carriers in the past decade: the Liaoning was a retrofit of an old Soviet model and the second, the Shandong, was...</description>
