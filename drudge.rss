      <title>Male angst prompts new fertility service: Sperm freezing...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Newfound-anxiety-about-sperm-health-inspires-next-13795699.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Gilbert Sanchez froze his sperm in January, shortly before his 25th birthday. He was healthy and at low-risk for fertility issues. But he wanted to be proactive - just as thousands of young women have been by putting their eggs on ice.  Sanchez was headed to graduate school in the fall, and it might be years before he would have a steady job and the wherewithal for a family. He and his girlfriend worried about all the things that could go wrong - disease, war, natural aging - before they might be ready.  "It was a little bit weird," admitted Sanchez, who stored his sperm with a company called Legacy. "But it was medically responsible."  Sanchez's choice highlights a new anxiety about sperm health among American men. The idea that men can easily father healthy children into their 70s and 80s has been exposed as a myth. In fact, research shows that older men have a higher risk that their partners will miscarry and have children with congenital abnormalities, schizophrenia or autism.  New businesses are capitalizing on those revelations. Start-ups like Trak, YO sperm and SpermCheck are selling at-home testing kits so men can figure out early on if there's something amiss with their sperm. Employee benefits companies are debating how to translate the fertility coverage they offer to female employees to their male counterparts. And sperm freezing companies are aiming to turn what has been a sterile, clinical process into something more cool - a 23andme or Ancestry.com for sperm.  Legacy, a company based at the Harvard Innovation Labs that launched in October, is part of a new breed of sperm freezing companies that aim to shake up the industry by offering mail-in kits that allow the whole process to be done in the privacy of one's home. A competitor, called Dadi (pronounced "daddy") and backed by $2 million...</description>

      <title>NFL newfound embrace of short passers...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/From-Doug-Flutie-to-Kyler-Murray-Inside-the-13753127.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doug Flutie, a quarterback consigned professionally to Canadian glory and journeyman status in his own country, admits he often thinks about how he might fit into the NFL today. He played in the 1980s and '90s and stood shorter than a standard refrigerator, which suddenly makes him a man born before his time.  Flutie was a jitterbug, 5-foot-10, Heisman-winning quarterback with uncommon arm strength for his size. Kyler Murray, a quarterback who fits that description precisely, might be this year's hottest NFL draft commodity.  "It just means," Flutie said, "I was 20 years too early."  For years, NFL executives turned away undersized quarterbacks like so many you-must-be-this-tall-to-enter-the-ride signs. One year after the Cleveland Browns took 6-foot-1 Baker Mayfield first overall, the Arizona Cardinals may pluck Murray with the same pick in this month's draft. Murray's stature once would have been detrimental to the point of disqualifying. As recently as 10 years ago, ESPN NFL Draft analyst Todd McShay posited, teams would have asked a quarterback like Murray to play slot receiver and return kicks.  Height still matters, of course - Murray briefly became the buzziest story in sports simply for measuring 5-10 instead of 5-9 at the NFL scouting combine. But now, as a response to several trends, the league does not only tolerate the package of skills and size Murray presents. It embraces athletic quarterbacks, even if they stand around 6-feet or shy of it. The adoption of shotgun-heavy, spread-reliant systems and prohibitions on how quarterbacks can be hit have cleared a path for humans of average size to play the most demanding position in professional sports.  In 2012, the Seattle Seahawks took 5-foot-11 Russell Wilson in the third round. Coach Pete Carroll called him a "living example" of how the sport has shifted. If a...</description>
