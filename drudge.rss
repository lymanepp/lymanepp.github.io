      <title>Comic's prison sentence sparks free-speech debate in Brazil...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Right-wing-comedian-s-prison-sentence-sparks-13846553.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO - Danilo Gentili is one of Brazil's most popular - and most offensive - comedians, with a late-night talk show and a massive Twitter following. A typical Gentili joke might speculate about this man's sexual orientation or deride that woman's weight.  But a burst of tweets against a congresswoman - at one point, he implied she was a prostitute - proved too vulgar for Brazil's legislators, and in 2017, he was ordered to delete the offensive tweets. So, in characteristic response, he tore the order into pieces and rubbed them on his genitals in a video that went viral.  In the view of the Brazilian judiciary, Gentili had gone too far, and this month a court ordered him jailed for six months. The judge found that Gentili's action was "intended to offend" and "never to be confused with a simple piece of spontaneous humor."  Gentili has cast himself as a martyr to political correctness: "I never imagined one day being sentenced to prison for protesting against censorship," he tweeted.  He is appealing, and legal analysts say he's unlikely to see the inside of a cell. But the line between offensive and criminally offensive has become a central issue in Brazil today, as the nation's institutions - including its new president - test the boundaries of the freedom of expression.  Brazilian law, which is largely modeled on the U.S. system, includes in its constitution echoes of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of expression. But a criminal provision that allows penalties for those who "disrespect" public officials opens a loophole for censorship.  That loophole, combined with a culture of high-level rule-dodging, has yielded several recent incidents that have provoked the concern of Brazilians and international observers alike - and created strange bedfellows in support of free speech: Gentili's defenders...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years, Reuben Brewer had been reading tragic news reports about police officers and motorists being killed and injured during traffic stops gone awry.  The root of the problem, he eventually realized, was fear, the powerful, anticipatory anxiety that can overwhelm a hyper-vigilant officer or cause a motorist to behave in ways that arouse suspicion, leading to a violent encounter.  Brewer knew he couldn't take guns from people who shouldn't wield them or single-handedly remove poorly trained police officers from American streets, but he wondered if there was a way to lower the temperature of everyday encounters between jittery police officers and the large numbers of drivers who fear for their lives each time police lights flash in their rearview mirror.  After 16 months of research and development, Brewer - a senior robotics researcher at the nonprofit SRI International in Menlo Park, California - has unveiled his solution: a robot that allows police officers to conduct traffic stops without leaving the safety of their vehicle.  "The main advantage of a robot over a human is that physical danger no longer matters," Brewer wrote after being reached by email. "The robot is purely defensive, so it can't hurt the motorist. If the motorist damages the robot, it's only money to replace it."  "People are more dangerous when they're scared, so the goal is to remove the possibility of being physically hurt so that they're less scared and less dangerous," he added.  Police officers make more than 50,000 traffic stops each day, according to The Stanford Open Policing Project, an effort that has tracked more than 200 million stops in recent years and found significant disparities in policing.  A survey released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2014 found that black motorists...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getty Images / Thomas Peter-Pool    The US-China trade war has dramatically escalated over the past few days, with both sides announcing tariff increases on billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods.   Chinese state media - which functions as a Communist Party mouthpiece - issued a series of rabble-rousing statements on Monday accusing the US of "greed and arrogance" and calling for a "people's war" against it.   President Donald Trump's administration on Monday night threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25% on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.   If such tariffs were to be imposed, almost all Chinese imports to the US would be subject to tariffs.   Trump tweeted on Tuesday that his "respect and friendship" with Chinese President Xi Jinping was "unlimited" but that "this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn't make any sense."
