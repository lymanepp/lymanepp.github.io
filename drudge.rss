      <title>STUDY: 78% of survivors have heart damage...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/927908/even-mild-coronavirus-cases-cause-lasting-cardiovascular-damage-study-shows</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you needed another reason to avoid coronavirus at all costs, here's one. Skeptics of the disease and the necessity of shutting down the economy to stop its spread have focused on the fact that most coronavirus cases have been mild or even asymptomatic, mistakenly comparing COVID-19 to 'just the flu.' But a recent study of 100 recovered coronavirus patients reveals 78 of them now have lasting cardiovascular damage even though a vast majority of them had mild cases of COVID-19 in the first place. The study published Monday in JAMA Cardiology details the results of cardiac MRI exams of 100 recovered coronavirus patients. Twenty-eight of them required oxygen supplementation while fighting the virus, while just two were on ventilators. But 78 of them still had cardiovascular abnormalities after recovery, with 60 of them showing 'ongoing myocardial inflammation,' the study shows. These conditions appeared to be independent of case severity and pre-existing conditions, though JAMA researchers note these findings need a larger study. President Trump and his administration have tried to say America's low coronavirus mortality rate proves the country is beating the virus. But not only is COVID-19's mortality rate not as low as Trump has claimed; this study proves there are far more consequences of catching coronavirus than just dying of it.

      <title>Barr plans to mount defiant defense of Trump in showdown with House Dems...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/What-to-expect-when-Barr-is-questioned-by-the-15438189.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Attorney General William Barr will tell the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that President Donald Trump has not inappropriately intervened in Justice Department business - even though Barr has more than once moved in criminal cases to help the president's allies - and he will defend the administration's response to civil unrest in the country, according to a copy of his opening statement.  Barr, according to the statement, will take a defiant posture as he testifies before the panel for the first time since Democrats took control of it, alleging that they have attempted to "discredit" him since he vowed to investigate the 2016 FBI probe of possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, and that the media has been unfair in covering unrest. He is expected to face critical questioning on his response to anti-police-brutality protests across the nation, his controversial interventions in high-profile cases involving allies of Trump and many other matters.  According to a Democratic committee counsel, lawmakers will ask Barr about his role in dispatching federal agents to respond to police-brutality protests that have at times grown violent - first in the District of Columbia and, more recently in Portland, Ore. Several Democratic leaders - including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, N.Y. - have asked the Justice Department and Homeland Security inspectors general to probe the federal government's actions in those cities and raised questions about whether they were legal.  "Citizens are concerned that the Administration has deployed a secret police force, not to investigate crimes but to intimidate individuals it views as political adversaries, and that the use of these tactics will proliferate throughout the country," Nadler and others wrote earlier this month.  Barr will...</description>
