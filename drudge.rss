      <title>White House won't retaliate over Kremlin bounty reports...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/White-House-won-t-retaliate-over-Kremlin-bounty-15380916.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The White House is not planning an immediate response to intelligence reports of Russian bounties given to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan because President Donald Trump does not believe the reports are true or "actionable," according to two senior administration officials.  Trump is not convinced he should do anything about the bounty issue, which he decried in a Wednesday morning tweet as "just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party." One administration official said there is an internal White House dispute about how much information to declassify to support the president's skepticism of the intelligence.  Some of Trump's own senior intelligence officials viewed the information as credible enough to warn the Pentagon and allies so they could ensure they had measures in place to protect their forces in Afghanistan, and to begin developing options for responding to the Russian operation, national security adviser Robert O'Brien said Wednesday.  And though the administration has sought to downplay the veracity of the intelligence, O'Brien said the CIA has asked the Justice Department to open a leak investigation on the matter.  The officials cautioned that Trump's posture could change as pressure mounts from Congress to respond to the reports of Russian bounties, as intelligence analysts suspect the deaths of three Marines in Afghanistan in 2019 may have resulted from the Russian operation. Like others interviewed, the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.  White House communications director Alyssa Farah declined to comment on the intelligence reports except to say they were "uncorroborated," and to criticize "selectively leaked intelligence." The president, she said, "always...</description>

      <title>Campaign STILL contending with fallout from Tulsa rally...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trump-campaign-still-contending-with-fallout-from-15380940.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was just hours before President Donald Trump was set to take the stage for his rally in Tulsa last month when the news broke: Six staff at the site had just tested positive for the coronavirus.  The president, who was en route from Washington, was livid that the news was public, according to people familiar with his reaction. In the tent outside the BOK Center, where campaign staff were being tested before the event, the release of the information caused a scramble.  Health-care workers were quizzed about whether they had leaked the information about the positive cases to the news media - and then were given a different list of people to test, according to two people with direct knowledge of the events.  The flurry inside the tent was part of a cascade of events triggered by Trump's insistence on holding the June 20 rally inside the Tulsa arena, despite the adamant warnings of health officials about the rising risks of the novel coronavirus in Oklahoma.  Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, said the Trump campaign "performed more tests than originally anticipated" in Tulsa, adding that the event was in compliance with Oklahoma state guidelines and that campaign employees "wore masks during the rally in accordance with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines."  He did not respond to follow-up questions about who received the additional tests at the site, which provided screening for not just staff, but local leaders and top Trump supporters, as well. He declined to specify whether more campaign staffers than anticipated were tested.  The White House referred requests for comment to the campaign.  On Sunday, a second round of testing was provided in Virginia for campaign staff, according to people familiar with the event. Murtaugh, who initially declined to...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/A-backyard-soiree-and-then-the-virus-15379805.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is A Cautionary Tale featuring well-intentioned people making poor choices. It is also the tale of a socialite with an Instagram habit who recently held a fabulous backyard soiree during a pandemic. The upside of living on social media is the admiration and envy of your friends. The downside is when your dinner party goes viral. Literally.  Ashley Taylor Bronczek, one of Washington, D.C.'s social stars, decided to throw a party after the Washington Ballet's online fundraiser, which she co-chaired. The June 18 gala was a huge success, raising more than $800,000 - the top sponsors were her generous in-laws, David and Judy Bronczek. To celebrate the occasion, she hosted a catered dinner for a couple dozen friends in the backyard of her home. It was, by all accounts, a picture-perfect night chronicled on (per usual) her Instagram account.  Then Bronczek, 37, was diagnosed with covid-19, along with a few other guests at the event. The news spread quickly through the wealthy young families in her social circle because their small children play together. Friends begged her to take down photos of the party, which she eventually did. But details of the evening - some true, some exaggerated - were already all over town.  This summer everyone is struggling to balance their yearning for normality with the risk of catching this virus. Young is safer than old. Outside is better than inside. Masks are better than no masks. And a handful of people are wiser than a lot of people. And so we make the calculation to attend or skip drinks on the patio, a backyard barbecue, a socially distanced birthday party. Most of the time it's fine. Unless it isn't.  Citing health issues, Bronczek originally offered to answer questions for this article via email, then changed her mind and declined to comment. Some guests who attended the party also...</description>

      <title>CLARENCE THOMAS SET TO RETIRE?</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Trump-supporters-hope-to-use-conservative-anger-15379138.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The White House is trying to capitalize on conservative anger at Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. over his latest decisions by telling evangelical leaders and other activists that they need to turn out voters for President Donald Trump so he can use a second term to continue nominating conservative judges to the nation's highest court.  Some recent polls have shown a weakening in support for Trump among evangelicals, who have long been among the president's strongest supporters. But Roberts's role in cases advancing both gay and abortion rights is now seen in the White House as an opening to shore up that part of Trump's political base.  Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said there is frustration and disappointment in evangelical ranks about Roberts's rulings, but he said he and others are not going to walk away from Trump.  "Voters of faith know that that project to shift the court in a more conservative direction is on the 5-yard line and it's a strategic imperative to get President Trump reelected," Reed said. "The Louisiana decision has brought the life issue into fuller relief and reminded us why we have to give the president the chance to nominate more justices."  In a remarkable stretch of decisions over the past two weeks, Roberts has infuriated conservatives and the Trump administration by finding that federal anti-discrimination law protects gay, bisexual and transgender workers and stopping the president from ending the federal program that protects undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children.  In Monday's decision striking down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law, Roberts said the court's allegiance to honoring its past decisions meant striking down a law almost identical to one in Texas that the court...</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Cries-for-help-Drug-overdoses-are-soaring-15379338.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bodies have been arriving at Anahi Ortiz's office in frantic spurts - as many as nine overdose deaths in 36 hours. "We've literally run out of wheeled carts to put them on," said Ortiz, a coroner in Columbus, Ohio.  In Roanoke County, Va., police have responded to twice as many fatal overdoses in recent months as in all of last year.  In Kentucky, which just celebrated its first decline in overdose deaths after five years of crisis, many towns are experiencing an abrupt reversal in the numbers.  Nationwide, federal and local officials are reporting alarming spikes in drug overdoses - a hidden epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic. Emerging evidence suggests that the continued isolation, economic devastation and disruptions to the drug trade in recent months are fueling the surge.  Because of how slowly the government collects data, it could be five to six months before definitive numbers exist on the change in overdoses during the pandemic. But data obtained by The Washington Post from a real-time tracker of drug-related emergency calls and interviews with coroners suggest that overdoses have not just increased since the pandemic began but are accelerating as it persists.  Suspected overdoses nationally - not all of them fatal - jumped 18% in March compared with last year, 29% in April and 42% in May, according to the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program, a federal initiative that collects data from ambulance teams, hospitals and police. In some jurisdictions, such as Milwaukee County, dispatch calls for overdoses have increased more than 50%.  When the pandemic hit, some authorities hoped it might lead to a decrease in overdoses by disrupting drug traffic as borders closed and cities shut down. The opposite seems to be happening.  As traditional supply...</description>
