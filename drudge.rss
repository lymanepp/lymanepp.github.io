      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Liberals-frustration-with-Pelosi-rises-over-her-13769941.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The far left's frustration with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is on the rise, as liberal advocates and lawmakers fume that she hasn't done enough to defend freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota from attacks by President Donald Trump and other Republicans and has undermined their policies and leaders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.  Omar's allies over the weekend were upset by what they viewed as Pelosi's delayed response in standing up for one of the two Muslim women in Congress after Trump accused Omar of playing down the tragedy of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Pelosi, whose initial statement criticizing Trump made no mention of Omar, said Monday that it was "beneath the dignity of the Oval Office" for Trump to have shared a video on Twitter of Omar spliced with footage of the burning twin towers.  But liberals seethed that Pelosi (California) and Democratic leaders did too little, too late. They were equally baffled by Pelosi's quip seeming to dismiss Ocasio-Cortez during a CBS "60 Minutes" interview Sunday, suggesting her "wing" of the party included "like five people."  "What we're seeing here is old-guard leadership trying to marginalize some of the big change agents who were elected in 2018 because they're afraid of what it means to their leadership in the future," said Charles Chamberlain, chair of the liberal group Democracy for America.  Using Pelosi's oft-repeated phrase - "Diversity is our strength and unity is our power" - Chamberlain said that when the speaker "tries to marginalize some of the newest leaders who are fighting hard . . . it's not a good look and it's not a smart strategy."  The tensions underscore Democrats' struggle to discern the best way to respond to Trump and the GOP's attacks on their far-left flank, criticism frequently centered on women of color.

      <title>At 31, Tim Tebow is one final step from MLB...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/At-31-with-the-NFL-behind-him-Tim-Tebow-is-one-13769494.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SYRACUSE, N.Y. - Tim Tebow was 18 years old, in green shorts and a gray T-shirt, walking from left field toward home plate for an offseason chat. He'd come to meet with his high school baseball coach, Greg Mullins, after school. Something's wrong, Mullins thought as Tebow approached. "Can we talk?" Tebow asked, and they moved to the dugout bench.  It was 2005, and Tebow, not yet a celebrity, had plotted out his future. His voice wavered. A few minutes into the conversation, Tebow shed a tear. He wouldn't play his senior season of baseball. He had decided to enroll early at Florida to pursue a football career.  "One of the hardest decisions I ever made was choosing to go football over baseball," Tebow said this month of that day at Nease High School in Florida, just south of Jacksonville. "It's an itch I've always had and a passion I've always had, and it didn't go away after years."  It's been 13 and a half years since the day Tebow's baseball career ended. Well, could have ended. Now, just weeks into year three of a rise through the minors, Tebow is one step from the major leagues. One step from his ultimate dream, which he set out for after his professional football career ended. While his foundation was growing and he was working as an ESPN college football analyst, he considered how the rest of his life would go. Maybe he'd give his "first love" another try. Maybe he'd try to play in the majors.  As his baseball odyssey extends into this spring, the question is how he'll handle the pitching for the Class AAA Syracuse Mets. The task at hand: cut down on strikeouts, hit for power, track down fly balls in the outfield. In Class AA, he struck out in more than 30 percent of his at-bats, but he hit a respectable .273. Through nine games this season, he's 5 for 31 with 13 strikeouts.  At 31, he is now being recognized for...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thousands of people around the world are watching Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral burn. Teams of professionals are likely collaborating to extinguish the flames. And yet from thousands of miles away, President Trump has still decided to weigh in with some unhelpful advice. As videos reveal the church's roof and spire has collapsed, America's notorious firefighting expert suggested some "flying water tankers" should take care of it. So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019 Surprisingly, Trump did not recommend raking the cathedral's floors to prevent future incidents. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
