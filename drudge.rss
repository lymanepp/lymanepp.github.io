      <title>Buttigieg performance gets enthusiastic applause -- from right...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/872016/pete-buttigiegs-debate-performance-gets-enthusiastic-applause--from-conservatives</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fourth Democratic debate will be make-or-break for many of the 12 candidates on stage Tuesday night, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg made sure to leave an impression. Curiously, though, he specifically drew praise from conservatives by pulling to the right of his more progressive opponents. "Buttigieg, who opened with a civility pitch but got lost in the progressive shuffle, clearly sees an opening in the center again," tweeted American Conservative editor and The Week contributor Jim Antle. Liz Mair, a libertarian and Republican communications strategist, praised Buttigieg's answer to an impeachment question that came early in the debate, when the mayor observed that after an inquiry, "think about where we'll be â€” vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now." Really good answer from Buttigieg on impeachment. Really, really good. â€” Liz Mair (@LizMair) October 16, 2019 Jennifer Rubin, a conservative writer for The Washington Post, marveled at Buttigieg's performance, tweeting that the mayor was "hitting this out of the park, out of the town." Matt Lewis, a conservative columnist at The Daily Beast, added: "I don't pretend to know how this exchange plays on the left, but ... Pete Buttigieg is winning this debate." The daughter of the late Republican Sen. John McCain, Meghan McCain, also cheered Buttigieg when he pushed back on former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's gun buyback proposal: Yesssss Mayor @PeteButtigieg! Finish him!!!!!!!! Beto and his insane gun buyback rhetoric which is completely implausible and unconstitutional. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/H5PRnoxr8L â€” Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) October 16, 2019 Many Democrats were, needless to say, less thrilled by Mayor Pete. "Buttigieg is getting closer to clinching the Republican nomination," quipped Farron Cousins, a co-host of the progressive Ring of Fire talk show. Jeva Lange</description>

      <title>Roy Cohn, architect of Trump strategy on impeachment...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Roy-Cohn-the-architect-of-Trump-s-strategy-on-14534364.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's road to fame has been propelled by willfully distorting reality to cloak the truth. "The Apprentice," for example, was perhaps TV's greatest "extreme makeover" of all time, portraying Trump as a fabulously wealthy businessman even as he was declaring fifth and sixth bankruptcies.  Given this history, Trump's repeated lies in the White House and his approach to combating the impeachment investigation undertaken by the House shouldn't surprise us. Trump is executive producing his own defense, including a letter produced by the White House counsel declaring the impeachment inquiry illegitimate - even though that is quite evidently not true - and refusing to cooperate.  While deception is a longtime Trump tactic, so too is it a longtime Republican tactic, one that dates to the beginning of the Cold War. And there is a tie between Trump's usage of the practice, and Republicans' usage: Trump's mentor, Roy Cohn.  In 1945, Republicans were desperate to stop the dynastic Democratic dominance of President Franklin Roosevelt. This led the GOP to inflame and exploit the nascent U.S. conflict with the Soviets to damage liberalism, and by extension, the Democratic Party. It built upon long-standing suspicions of the Soviet Union to create a villainous, fearsome cartoon enemy that threatened the possible apocalypse.  It didn't matter that the U.S.S.R. was a wreck after World War II, an impoverished, dysfunctional state, weaker than the United States by every metric. What mattered were the potential domestic political benefits of hysterical rhetoric about the risk posed by the Soviets, not actual national security issues. By dramatically overestimating the might of the Soviet Union, Republicans justified political attacks on anyone who minimized the communist threat. In that propaganda campaign, Cohn emerged as...</description>
