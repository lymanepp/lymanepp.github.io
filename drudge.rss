Those protesting Pence's invitation to the Upland school with less than 2,000 undergrads argue he doesn't represent their Christian values and makes them feel unsafe.</description>

      <title>Funeral as we know becoming relic -- just in time for death boom...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/The-funeral-as-we-know-it-is-becoming-a-relic-13767619.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dayna West knows how to throw a fabulous memorial shindig. She hired Los Angeles celebration-of-life planner Alison Bossert - yes, those now exist - to create what West dubbed "Memorialpalooza" for her father, Howard, in 2016 a few months after his death.  "None of us is going to get out of this alive," says Bossert, who helms Final Bow Productions. "We can't control how or when we die, but we can say how we want to be remembered."  At Howard's remembrance, there was a crowd of more than 300 people at Sony Pictures Studios. A hot-dog cart from the famed L.A. stand Pink's. Gift bags, the hit being a baseball cap inscribed with "Life's not fair, get over it" (a beloved Howardism). A constellation of speakers, with Jerry Seinfeld as the closer (Howard was his personal manager). And babka (a tribute to a favorite "Seinfeld" episode).  "My dad never followed rules," says West, 56, a Bay Area clinical psychologist. So why would his memorial service?  Death is a given, but not the time-honored rituals. An increasingly secular, nomadic and casual America is shredding the rules about how to commemorate death, and it's not just among the wealthy and famous. Somber, embalmed-body funerals, with their $9,000 industry average price tag, are, for many families, a relic. Instead, end-of-life ceremonies are being personalized: golf-course cocktail send-offs, backyard potluck memorials, more Sinatra and Clapton, less "Ave Maria," more Hawaiian shirts, fewer dark suits. Families want to put the "fun" in funerals.  The movement will accelerate as the nation approaches a historic spike in deaths. Baby boomers, despite strenuous efforts to stall the aging process, are not getting any younger. In 2030, people over 65 are expected to outnumber children, and by 2037, 3.6 million people are projected to die in the United States, according to the...</description>
