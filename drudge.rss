      <title>Nunes could face second ethics investigation... </title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Rep-Devin-Nunes-could-face-second-ethics-14858221.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A high-ranking House Democrat said Saturday it's "quite likely" Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., will face an ethics investigation over allegations that he met with an ex-Ukrainian official to obtain information about former vice president Joe Biden and his son.  Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, appeared on MSNBC where he was asked whether Nunes could face a House inquiry. "Quite likely, without question," Smith said.  The allegation that Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, met with a former Ukrainian prosecutor last year to discuss the Bidens came from the attorney for Lev Parnas, one of two Soviet-born associates of Rudy Giuliani who were indicted on charges they broke campaign finance law.  Parnas' attorney, Joseph Bondy, told The Washington Post that Ukraine's former top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, informed Parnas that he had met with Nunes in Vienna in December 2018.  Bondy also said that a top aide to Nunes, Derek Harvey, sometimes joined a group that met frequently in spring 2019 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, District of Columbia, to discuss the Biden matter among other topics. The group, according to Bondy, was convened by Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal attorney, and included Parnas, his business associate Igor Fruman, as well as journalist John Solomon and the married legal team of Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing.  The information about Nunes' meeting with Shokin and Harvey's meetings with Giuliani were first reported by CNN on Friday.  Nunes declined to comment. He did, however, strongly push back on the story to the conservative outlet Breitbart News and threatened to sue CNN for reporting it. He also threatened to sue the Daily Beast for a story...</description>

      <title>A 230-year-old Mount Vernon tree, witness to history, is no more...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was probably a sapling when George Washington returned to Mount Vernon in 1783, triumphant after his victory in the Revolutionary War.  It was probably there on the Virginia estate in 1787 when he left for the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, and it grew during his terms as the country's first president. It was there when he came home for good, and when he died in 1799.  Droughts came and went, along with two centuries of American history. (Civil War soldiers carved insignia in its bark.) Then, late one night earlier this month, the tired old white oak gave out and came crashing down across a road in the woods.  Caretakers on the grounds of Mount Vernon heard it fall just before midnight on Nov. 4.  "Middle of the night," Dean Norton, Mount Vernon's director of horticulture, said Thursday. "No wind. It just falls over."  It was about 115 feet tall, 12 feet around, and at roughly age 230, it was almost as old as the United States.  Witness to so much history, "trees just give up, on occasion," Norton said. It wasn't sick. "It just was its time."  The tree dated at least to 1780, he said. Once it had fallen, and was cut, he was able to carefully measure the tree rings that help date a tree and tell its story.  "Oak tree rings are probably some of the easiest rings to count," he said. "They're really distinctive." He said his count is conservative. "The tree could be older than 1780, but I can honestly say that it at least goes back to that."  George Washington owned the Mount Vernon plantation, along with its home and more than 100 enslaved people, from 1761 until he died. He and his wife, Martha, are buried on the property, which is on the Potomac River about 15 miles south of Washington.  Norton said there is also a possibility that Washington had purposely...</description>
