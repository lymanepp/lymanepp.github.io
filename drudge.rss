      <title>Hundreds of pets lost...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Hundreds-of-pets-were-lost-in-the-California-14572942.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The submissions pour in by the second.  Tabby cats lost during an evacuation in the Chalk Hill area of Sonoma County. Two friendly goats, Jean Claude and Spanky, who each respond to "boys!" with a whistle at the end. A black and white Border Collie mix that turned up last Wednesday at Sonoma County Animal Services.  The mishmash of animals - lost and found - comprise just a fraction of those displaced from their owners as the Kincade Fire rages in Northern California. The blaze has already spurred unprecedented blackouts and forced more than 200,000 people to flee their homes, sometimes without warning, causing hundreds of cats, dogs, horses and other livestock to be left behind.  Enter Tai Bruce, the 33-year-old co-creator of Pet Rescue and Reunification, a grass roots Facebook effort to compile posts and notices of missing animals all in one place. Bruce and a team of like-minded volunteers work both online and in the field to identify lost pets, track them down and reunite them with their owners - a tireless effort that will continue long after the fire subsides.  Bruce, a former San Francisco Animal Care &amp; Control reserve officer who now lives in Oregon, said she began the initiative with a few other volunteers during the 2015 Valley Fire , located about 100 miles north of San Francisco. They duplicated their efforts for the similarly-destructive 2017 wildfires in Northern California as well as the deadly 2018 Camp Fire. She says the pattern is similar each time: a flurry of Facebook posts and messages from devastated pet owners, desperately in search of their animals with little idea where to look.  Local shelters, clinics and veterinary offices are a good place to start, Bruce said. But oftentimes, pet owners affected by the sudden evacuation orders possess little identifying information for their animals other...</description>

      <title>Sexy witch. Sexy nurse. Sexy Mr. Rogers? Inside Halloween costume industrial complex...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/Sexy-witch-Sexy-nurse-Sexy-Mr-Rogers-Inside-14570780.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHOENIX - Four weeks before Halloween, Dominique Fiacco tried on the costume that its creators hope to turn into one of the holiday's hottest and stepped in front of the camera in a small photography studio.  The tanned, dark-haired model was the first to wear "Miss Impeachment": A clingy peach halter gown with a high slit, a low neckline and a pageant-girl sash across her torso. Also, a princess crown, clear plastic heels (sold separately) and, on a string around her neck, a finishing-touch accessory to take the costume over the top.  "Blow that whistle!" said designer Pilar Quintana-Williams as the camera flashed.  Of course there is a sexy impeachment costume. Yandy, a lingerie and costume company where Quintana-Williams is the vice president of merchandising, can hook you up with pretty much any kind of sexy costume you want - sexy witch, sexy nurse, sexy pirate, sexy Buzz Lightyear, sexy Supreme Court justice, sexy clown from "It," sexy pizza, sexy Minion. In recent years, the company has specialized in costumes with highly topical themes taken from politics and pop culture, so when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi initiated an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, it took Yandy barely a week to turn around its Miss Impeachment outfit.  "Can you do a little bit of a surprised face? Like, I just won my pageant!" Quintana-Williams asked Fiacco.  "Like, I'm going to Disney World!" said photographer Brittany Gentile.  "Or jail!" added Quintana-Williams.  A perfect segue to Fiacco's next costume: Sexy college admissions scandal. It consisted of an orange prison uniform, but with leggings and a crop top. "INMATE" was stenciled across the chest, under the crossed-out text reading "Mom of the Year."  "Handcuffs or no handcuffs?" asked Quintana-Williams. "They're plain,...</description>

      <title>PAPER: Lana Del Rey isn't trying to fool you...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/entertainment/article/Lana-Del-Rey-isn-t-trying-to-fool-you-14570718.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SANTA BARBARA, Calif. - Here's a wild idea: What if Lana Del Rey is exactly who she says she is?  Her music keeps making us think otherwise. It's still too elegant, too plush, too slippery to be real. Maybe that's why, in concert, she likes to talk about a song after she sings it, as if to confirm that it wasn't just a puff of Chanel No. 5 in our collective imagination.  At the Hollywood Bowl this month, she performed "Wicked Game" with Chris Isaak. "We can't be in the middle of Hollywood and not hear the sexiest song of all time," Del Rey explained as Isaak exited the stage. She wasn't thanking her guest so much as expressing her gratitude to sexiness as a sound.  Has everyone heard "Norman F---ing Rockwell!" by now? It's the greatest Lana Del Rey album, dizzying and precise, unknowable and lucid, unprecedented while still feeling like more of the same, genius all the way. She's still blowing thought bubbles from the privacy of her mind into the slipstream of the American Dream, but this time around, she's pared down the studio production and cranked up the paradox. The more beautiful her music becomes, the stranger it feels. It's a triumph.  For years, the easiest way to reconcile the strangeness of Lana Del Rey was to tell ourselves that we were listening to a persona. Here was a remote pop star dream-journaling from a perspective too fabulous to belong to an actual human being.  Del Rey has rejected that idea from the jump. When NPR published a deep, diligent, largely flattering review of her new album last month, Del Rey took issue with its mention of personae and blasted back on social media: "Never had a persona. Never needed one. Never will." Gawkers are still gawking at that retort, but why not take her at her word? Back in 2011, at the dawn of her fame, she told Pitchfork, "I'm not trying to create an image or...</description>

      <title>In manufacturing Midwest, signs of trouble amid good times...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/business/article/In-manufacturing-Midwest-signs-of-trouble-amid-14570918.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MANITOWOC, Wis. - Sachin Shivaram, the chief executive of Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry, started to worry this summer when orders for his brake housings and conveyor belt motors first grew scarce. Within weeks, what began as mild concern snowballed into a business drought that has seen bookings plunge by 40%.  In August, Shivaram, 38, reluctantly laid off two dozen workers, hoping to recall them when the outlook improved. It hasn't.  "Things are not good. We didn't anticipate this level of deterioration," he said. "Orders are down across the board."  The sudden slump at this 110-year-old company illustrates the economic erosion that is challenging President Donald Trump's signature promise to restore a lost era of American manufacturing greatness. Even as the $21 trillion U.S. economy continues growing, and unemployment hovers at a half-century low, factory activity has contracted for two consecutive months, according to the closely watched Institute for Supply Management index.  Many consumer-goods makers are still humming. But manufacturers that serve global markets are being buffeted by trade wars and profound uncertainty over the future.  Already, plants in several Midwestern states that will be crucial to the president's reelection campaign are shedding workers. Manufacturing employment is down by almost 9,000 in Pennsylvania over the past year and 6,800 in Wisconsin. Michigan, Indiana and Minnesota also have lost factory jobs, though in Ohio assembly lines continue to add them.  The president's tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union - and those trading partners' retaliation against the United States - are sapping manufacturers' strength, economists said. Through August, Wisconsin companies' exports to China of $822 million were 25% less than in the same...</description>
