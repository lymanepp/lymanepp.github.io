      <link>https://www.apnews.com/eedcdc699cf74979bdc363587319f1ea</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PITTSBURGH (AP) — A 97-year-old woman who was the oldest victim of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre will be laid to rest at the end of a wrenching, weeklong series of funerals. Rose Mallinger's funeral was scheduled for Friday. She was among 11 victims gunned down in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Her daughter was among six wounded. The suspect, Robert Bowers, pleaded not guilty Thursday to federal charges that could result in a death sentence. Bowers, 46, was arraigned on a 44-count indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes.</description>

      <title>Rebel priest says he's being punished by church...</title>
      <link>https://www.apnews.com/d67ba70cabbd49d2b6f237495f2560e0</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARIS (AP) — A Catholic priest says he's been punished by church leaders in France after he gathered more than 100,000 signatures with an online petition that called for a prominent cardinal to resign over his handling of child sex-abuse cases. Rev. Pierre Vignon says he was informed by email Thursday that he is no longer being considered for service on a church court where he has officiated as a judge since 2002. Speaking Friday in a phone interview, Vignon says the decision shows that church leaders remain in two minds about how to deal with sex-abuse cases.</description>

The wild card: Angela Green, a Green Party candidate who could win votes that might have gone to Democrat Krysten Sinema, clearing a path to victory for Republican Martha McSally. But on Thursday, Green suddenly announced she would drop out of the race and endorsed Sinema.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday he plans to sign an order next week that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum — two legally dubious proposals that mark his latest election-season barrage against illegal immigration. Trump also said he had told the U.S. military mobilizing at the southwest border that if U.S. troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were "rifles."</description>

Nest ads will show you beautiful images of mother nature captured on their outdoor cameras, life’s silly moments and even those moments when your child is up to no good.  But for this Long Island mother, the Nest cam she and her husband set up around their home to act as a nanny cam became a full-on nightmare.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump is fond of asserting that "Collusion is not a crime, but that [it] doesn't matter because there was No Collusion."

If such charges are filed, that would have profound consequences for those around Trump, the president himself and for our democracy. That target appears to be Roger Stone, the political provocateur and longtime Trump confidante. Stone himself has said he believes he may be indicted, declaring that "Robert S.</description>
