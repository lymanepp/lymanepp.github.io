      <title>Three-month battle tested political will of both parties...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Three-month-battle-tested-the-political-will-of-14917367.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sat quietly at the head of the long table inside her ornate conference room early this month, listening as her deputies debated the last major decision in the impeachment of President Donald Trump.  Her senior lieutenants argued for an expansive bill of charges encompassing the Mueller report. Others pressed for articles of impeachment focused solely on Trump's pressure on Ukraine to help his reelection bid.  Ultimately, it didn't matter. Pelosi had all but made up her mind.  Two days earlier, while she was in a Madrid hotel for a climate conference, Pelosi took a call from anxious moderate members of her Democratic caucus who were feeling heat in their home districts about supporting impeachment. The speaker, they said, should resist liberal calls to expand the investigation.  Pelosi did not tip her hand on the call. But it was a compelling argument from her "majority makers," the group whose members flipped pro-Trump districts in 2018, helping make Pelosi speaker for the second time, and have guided her thinking from the earliest moments of the three-month impeachment saga.  "It was not much of a debate," Pelosi, D-Calif., recalled in an interview Tuesday. "When we made our decision to go forward, there was no opposition to it."  The back and forth was a closing snapshot of how Democrats proceeded toward Wednesday's momentous vote to impeach Trump on two counts, abusing his power and obstructing Congress. While the Democrats voted almost entirely in lockstep, and the outcome was never truly in doubt, the result belied an emotional and often caustic behind-the-scenes drama that exposed - and at times exacerbated - divisions within the House Democratic caucus.  The experience tested the will of centrist Democrats from pro-Trump...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump wasn't happy that Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) voted to impeach him, and went low with his response. As the House of Representatives voted on Wednesday night, Trump was speaking to supporters at a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan. He asked the crowd if they knew Dingell, calling her a 'real beauty,' and then mentioned that after her husband, the late Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), died earlier this year, he offered to give the family 'A+ treatment' when it came to the state funeral. 'I didn't give him the B treatment,' Trump said. 'I didn't give him the C or the D. I could have.' He claimed that Debbie Dingell called him gushing, saying it was 'the nicest thing that's ever happened, thank you so much, John is looking down.' Trump said he told her not to worry about it, and then gave a cruel aside. 'Maybe he's looking up, I don't know,' he said. 'Maybe.' The crowd 'ooohed' like they were in the audience of Maury, and Trump added, 'Let's assume he's looking down.' Watch the video below. Catherine Garcia Trump laments that Debbie Dingell voted to impeach him despite the fact that he allowed the normal state funeral to proceed for her late husband, former Rep. John Dingell. Trump then suggests John Dingell is in hell -- to audible groans. pic.twitter.com/wsYfddNIA9 â€” Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 19, 2019</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump's impeding impeachment is now not only being compared to Jesus' crucifixion, but Pearl Harbor, too. The latest hyperbolic analogy to emerge from Wednesday's impeachment debate came from Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Penn.), who opened his remarks by noting all of the 'great dates' that there are in December like Christmas and the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party. 'But also, on Dec. 7, 1941, a horrific act happened in the United States, and it's one that President Roosevelt said, 'this is a date that will live in infamy,' Kelly said. 'Today, December the 18th, 2019, is another date that will live in infamy.' This came just about a half hour after Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) compared Trump's impeachment to Jesus' crucifixion, saying that 'Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this president.' For those keeping track at home, this means Trump and his defenders have in the past 24 hours compared the impeachment vote to Pearl Harbor, Jesus' crucifixion, and the Salem Witch Trials, with the president writing in his blistering letter yesterday that 'more due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials' than to him. Impeachment has thus far been compared to:-Salem witch trials-Jesus's crucifixion-Pearl Harbor â€” Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) December 18, 2019 Plenty more impeachment debate remains, leaving room for even more absurd comparisons before the vote is held this evening.
