      <title>PRINCETON seminary students asking for reparations for school's role in slavery...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Princeton-seminary-students-are-asking-for-13708289.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Princeton Theological Seminary last year released a report describing its founders' and early faculty's ties to slavery. Now, some of its students want the school to take it a step further and provide reparations as financial restitution for its role in the slave trade.  A group of black seminarians have collected more than 400 signatures in an online petition calling on the New Jersey school to "make amends" by setting aside $5.3 million annually - or 15 percent of what the seminary uses from the school's endowment for its operating expenses - to fund tuition grants for black students and establish a Black Church Studies program.  A progressive seminary like Princeton could be a pioneer by distributing reparations, said Justin Henderson, president of the Association of Black Seminarians, the group behind the petition. The school has confessed and repented for the "sin" of its role in slavery, but "repentance doesn't end with confession," said Henderson, who will finish his master of divinity studies in May.  "Restitution is evidence of the repentance.," he said. "This is how we know the person has repented."  The idea of reparations was popularized by Ta-Nehisi Coates' 2014 cover story in The Atlantic, "The Case for Reparations." It has resurfaced in recent months as an issue in the 2020 presidential race, finding support among Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. They have not revealed specific plans, but those Democratic candidates signaled a shift from other leaders, such as former president Barack Obama, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is running again for the Democratic Party nominee, and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who declined to support reparations in the past.  Princeton's report resulted after a two-year...</description>

      <title>More than half young people don't have romantic partner...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/It-s-not-just-you-New-data-shows-more-than-half-13706291.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Austin Spivey, a 24-year-old woman in Washington, has been looking for a relationship for years. She's been on several dating apps - OkCupid, Coffee Meets Bagel, Hinge, Tinder, Bumble. She's on a volleyball team, where she has a chance to meet people with similar interests in a casual setting. She's even let The Washington Post set her up.  "I'm a very optimistic dater," Spivey says, adding that she's "always energetic to keep trying." But it can get a little frustrating, she adds, when she's talking to someone on a dating app and they disappear mid-conversation. (She's vanished too, she admits.)  Spivey has a lot of company in her frustration, and in her singledom. Just over half of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 - 51 percent of them - said they do not have a steady romantic partner, according to data from the General Social Survey released this week. That 2018 figure is up significantly from 33 percent in 2004 - the lowest figure since the question was first asked in 1986 - and up slightly from 45 percent in 2016. The shift has helped drive singledom to a record high among the overall public, among whom 35 percent say they have no steady partner, but only up slightly from 33 percent in 2016 and 2014.  There are several other trends that go along with the increase in young single Americans. Women are having fewer children, and they're having them later in life. The median age of first marriage is increasing. And according to a 2017 report from the Pew Research Center, among those who have never married but are open to it, most say a major reason is because they haven't found the right person.  Of course, not everyone who's under 35 and single is looking to change that. Caitlin Phillips, a 22-year-old student at the University of Georgia, is open to love if it walked into her life, but she's not actively...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;ktla.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The commandant of the Marines has warned the Pentagon that deployments to the southwest border and funding transfers under the president's emergency declaration, among other unexpected demands, have posed “unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and solvency.” In two internal memos, Marine Corps Gen. Robert Neller said the “unplanned/unbudgeted” deployment along the border that President Trump ordered last fall, and shifts of other funds to support border security, had forced him to cancel or reduce planned military training in at least five countries, and delay urgent repairs at bases.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On their way from Mexico to Alaska, gray whales are making a pit-stop in San Francisco - and staying a while.  "Historically, one or two gray whales would temporarily pass underneath the Golden Gate Bridge during this time period. Last week alone, experts counted five entering the Bay," said the Marine Mammal Center in a recent press release.  Not only are more coming to town, they're also hanging out much longer than expected. One gray whale has been in and around the San Francisco Bay for more than a month now.</description>
