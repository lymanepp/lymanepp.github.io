      <title>SILVER: Brokered convention more likely than nominating Warren...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/888730/brokered-convention-more-likely-than-elizabeth-warren-winning-nomination-fivethirtyeight-forecasts</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Democratic nominee is starting to take shape in FiveThirtyEight's 2020 vision. The data-driven news site gives former Vice President Joe Biden the best chance of locking down the 2020 Democratic nomination in its primary forecast that debuted Thursday. But things get more complicated beyond the top two candidates, with FiveThirtyEight predicting the Democratic National Committee could arrive at its convention without a nominee. Democratic candidates need to win more than half of pledged delegates ahead of the convention to land the presidential nomination. Biden has a two in five chance of earning that majority, FiveThirtyEight says, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) has a one in five chance. But the next most likely outcome isn't that prominent candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) or former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg win the nomination. It's that no one gets a majority of delegates at all, FiveThirtyEight predicts. The chances of ending up with a contested convention are one in seven, FiveThirtyEight forecasts. Warren meanwhile gets a one in eight chance of locking up the nomination, Buttigieg gets 1 in 10, and all the other Democrats out there get a collective one in 40.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, made their shocking announcement Wednesday on Instagram - that they plan to step back as senior royals and split their time between the United Kingdom and North America - they also encouraged their 10.4 million followers to visit their new website, SussexRoyal.com, to find more information.  One part of the glossy site that hinted at a possible reason behind their bombshell decision? The "Media" section.  In several long paragraphs, Harry and Meghan explained that they will be taking a "revised media approach" in their new roles. Most significantly, they will no longer be a part of the "royal rota" system - essentially a press pool - in which a group of U.K. outlets get exclusive access to royal events and share that information with other publications.  However, the couple emphasized that they will "provide access to credible media outlets focused on objective news reporting," adding that they understand that there is great interest in them as members of the royal family. "They welcome accurate and honest media reporting as well as being held to account if appropriate," the website reads.  The key words here, of course, are "credible," "accurate" and "honest," apparent digs at the brutal tabloid stories that Harry and Meghan have endured for the past several years. In the fall, the couple sued the Mail on Sunday newspaper for publishing a private letter that Meghan wrote to her estranged father after her wedding; Harry also filed a lawsuit against The Daily Mirror and The Sun, claiming they hacked his phone.  Royal experts and observers say there are many complicated reasons behind Harry and Meghan's new path. But it seems clear that intrusive tabloid coverage added to their motivation to step away from royal tradition.  "I think it had a significant impact,"...</description>
