      <title>Venezuelan embassy goes dark as standoff intensifies on DC streets...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Venezuelan-embassy-goes-dark-as-standoff-13832785.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The sun had just dipped below the horizon Wednesday evening when the lights flicked off inside the Venezuelan embassy in Washington.  Waves of cheers rolled up and down the ordinarily quiet street in the elite Georgetown neighborhood at the center of an intensifying standoff between backers of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó and left-wing activists who oppose U.S. intervention and support President Nicolás Maduro.  With no electricity, the activists who have been living inside the building adjusted to the latest challenge in their month-long occupation of the embassy. Organizers with Code Pink, a left-leaning organization known for its theatrical and provocative protests, said the utility bills had been paid in full by the building's owners: the Maduro-led Venezuelan government.  The group has been inside the embassy since April 10 at the invitation of Maduro government officials. About two weeks into Code Pink's residency, Venezuelan and Venezuelan-American protesters began to gather outside. They have not left since.  The embassy, a four-story brick building on a quiet side street near the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, has become the site of a proxy power struggle that mirrors the international fight over the future of Venezuela.  Activists inside the building Thursday said they had no running water or electricity, although a spokesman for D.C. Water said water had not been shut off to the property. The utility Pepco declined to comment on why the electricity apparently was cut.  "Out of respect for customer privacy and public safety and in accordance with Public Service Commission regulations, Pepco does not discuss the status of individual customer accounts or service to individual properties," the company said in a statement. "This privacy protocol covers all Pepco customers including...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARIS (AP) - Notre Dame Cathedral's melted roof has left astronomically high lead levels in the plaza outside and adjacent roads.  Paris police say lead levels from the roof were found to be between 10 and 20 grams per kilogram of ground - between 32 and 65 times the recommended limit by French health authorities of 0.3 grams per kilogram. The areas closest to the cathedral are currently closed.  The statement Thursday said the main danger is lead dust that could coat surfaces of nearby homes and businesses. To avoid lead poisoning, authorities have recommended a good cleaning with a damp cloth, and that pregnant women and children wash hands frequently.  Hundreds of tons of lead were used in Notre Dame's frame, as well as the church spire that burned and collapsed.</description>
