      <title>The backroom deals that saved Andrew Johnson's presidency by single Senate vote...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-backroom-deals-that-saved-Andrew-Johnson-s-15019381.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The impeachment trial was almost over, and Sen. James Grimes was tormented with doubt.  The Iowa senator couldn't stand Andrew Johnson, the belligerent, racist president on trial before the Senate, charged with defying Congress and the law. Johnson was "guilty of a great many follies and wickedness," the mustachioed, mutton-chopped Grimes had written in a letter to his wife.  Grimes feared that if the president were acquitted, he would unleash even more revenge against his enemies and stoke racial violence in the South. But the senator, a moderate Republican, also couldn't stand the impeachers, the radicals trying to tear Johnson from the White House in the name of racial equality. He thought they'd gone too far.  So just before closing arguments began in Johnson's trial in April 1868, Grimes sent messages to Johnson through intermediaries, including one of the president's defense lawyers. If Johnson agreed not to engage in rash acts that might "encourage rebels" in the South, and if he nominated a "secretary of war in whom the country had confidence," Grimes said, "it would help him" - that is, Grimes and other swing-vote senators might vote to acquit Johnson.  So amid the impeachment trial's closing arguments, Johnson sent the Senate a nomination: Gen. John Schofield, Grimes' suggested candidate, for war secretary. That got the senators buzzing.  "During the last 24 hours," another of Johnson's lawyers wrote to the president, "impeachment has gone rapidly astern."  When the nation's first presidential impeachment trial began 152 years ago, Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, was in serious danger of conviction by the Republican-dominated Senate. But the power to end a presidency also created intense pressure on the senators who would cast the deciding votes.  The same pressures...</description>

      <title>In angry America, new remedy emerges: Compassion...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/In-an-angry-America-a-new-remedy-emerges-15017025.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the head of a big-city hospital's emergency department, Susan O'Mara has always focused on providing quick answers to people in crisis: A relative desperate for information. An injured person facing a very long wait. A colleague exhausted from dealing with fed-up patients. But until a special training a few months ago, O'Mara didn't consider whether there were ways to be more compassionate in her response.  The training taught the doctor to pause and listen, and not jump to fix or respond defensively if an angry patient is on the offense. She said it has helped her focus better and find a deeper well of sympathy, even as she deals with trying situations at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in the nation's capital.  "You want to get patients from Point A to Point B with compassion, and also not internalize and feel badly yourself," she said. "To approach someone who is sad, scared, angry - to approach someone who is angry with compassion is the Holy Grail of emergency medicine."  Defined as the ability to notice suffering (in ourselves and others) and then the desire to take action to alleviate it, "compassion" has become the buzzword for an angry nation. It is increasingly being held up by neuroscientists, corporations, business schools and psychologists as a concrete, powerful health strategy - and a successful business model.  Universities have opened centers devoted to compassion. Marianne Williamson and Cory Booker talked about it as an urgent American need during their presidential campaigns. Job networker LinkedIn and wealth manager Brighton Jones both recently created a director of compassion position.  Experts say this shift is the result of new research showing compassion's impact, as well as an urgent desire to address rising rates of depression and anxiety among young people, and a steep climb of rates of...</description>

      <title>GEORGE CONWAY:  Defense is just one big lie... </title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/opinion/article/Trump-s-defense-is-just-one-big-lie-15018316.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The president's lawyers this week floated their catch-all impeachment defense, one tailor-made for President Donald Trump. It is, in essence, that a narcissistic president can do no wrong.  Like most of the president's arguments, it's erroneous. But no argument could have presented the issue more starkly to Republican senators: Will they follow their oaths to defend the Constitution and to do impartial justice? Or will they once again show fealty to Trump personally, thereby accepting his conflation of his personal interests with those of the nation?  The Trump lawyers' challenge to the Senate began with their answer to the very first question from senators. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah asked: What if the president had a mixed motive - if he thought he was acting both "in pursuit of a personal political advantage" and in "promotion of national interests"? White House Deputy Counsel Patrick Philbin responded without caveat. That "cannot possibly be the basis for an impeachable offense," he said.  Leave it to Alan Dershowitz to drive the point home with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. If "a president does something which he believes will get himself elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment," Dershowitz contended.  For a president psychologically incapable of distinguishing between his own personal interests and the nation's, that amounts to the ultimate get-out-of-impeachment-free card. Trump already believes that "I have an Article II" - Article II of the Constitution - "where I have the right to do whatever I want as president." This self-described very stable genius, he of "I alone can fix it," is convinced that his reelection, achieved by whatever means necessary, serves the interests of the...</description>
