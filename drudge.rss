      <title>BALZ: Her biggest test awaits...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/For-Pelosi-the-biggest-test-awaits-Impeach-or-13896496.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;House Democrats, under the leadership of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are slowly marching themselves toward the opening of an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. What seemed out of the question earlier in the year now seems, if not inevitable, increasingly difficult to resist.  Pelosi will not say anything like that at this point. She will continue to try to communicate to both sides of her divided party, nodding to hard-liners by suggesting that Trump's actions constitute potentially impeachable offenses while bowing to vulnerable members in swing districts by speaking cautiously about impeachment itself.  "We're not at that place," Pelosi said at a Thursday news conference, when the question of impeachment came up. That caution came after she noted that the investigations currently underway in the House could lead to "a place that is unavoidable in terms of impeachment." She also asserted that the White house "is just crying out" for impeachment, which she likely sees as a trap.  Trump has certainly put the Democrats in a difficult position. His past actions to disrupt and interfere with the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller are spelled out in detail in Mueller's report. Attorney General William Barr has said the evidence does not constitute obstruction of justice. Others strongly disagree, including many House Democrats who want to hear more about those episodes.  Beyond the contents of the Mueller report and what they say about the question of obstruction, the administration has further inflamed things by blocking virtually all requests from congressional committees for documents for investigations into various Trump-related matters. The president also ordered former White House counsel Donald McGahn not to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. When McGahn defied a subpoena...</description>

      <title>FACEBOOK: No 'Must Be True' Policy, But 'Heavily Reducing' Pelosi Clip...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Facebook-acknowledges-Pelosi-video-is-faked-but-13894687.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an edited video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., began spreading across the Web this week, researchers quickly identified it as a distortion, with sound and playback speed that had been manipulated to make her speech appear stilted and slurred.  But in the hours after the social-media giants were alerted, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube offered widely conflicting responses that potentially allowed the viral misinformation to continue its spread.  YouTube offered a definitive response Thursday afternoon, saying the company had removed the videos because they violated "clear policies that outline what content is not acceptable to post."  Twitter declined to comment. But sharing the video would likely not conflict with the company's policies, which permit "inaccurate statements about an elected official" as long as they don't include efforts of election manipulation or voter suppression. Several tweets sharing the video, often alongside insults that Pelosi was "drunk as (a) skunk," remained online Friday.  But Facebook, where the video appeared to gain much of its audience, declined Friday to remove the video, even after Facebook's independent fact-checking groups, Lead Stories and PolitiFact, deemed the video "false."  "We don't have a policy that stipulates that the information you post on Facebook must be true," Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post.  The company said it instead would "heavily reduce" the video's appearances in people's News Feeds, append a small informational box alongside the video linking to the two fact-check sites, and open a pop-up box linking to "additional reporting" whenever someone clicks to share the video.  That didn't satisfy lawmakers such as Rep. David N. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, who took to Twitter to...</description>
