      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mediaite.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Independent Journal Review, a millennial-focused website that soared in popularity during the 2016 election for its viral news with a conservative bent, fired four more staffers this week as it plans to fundamentally change its mission and convert to a nonprofit, Mediaite has learned. The latest round of layoffs leaves behind a skeleton staff at a site once heralded as the future of digital news media. IJR President Camden Stuebe confirmed the layoffs to Mediaite, stating they come as the site prepares to transition to a non-profit in the fall. But Steube said the staff remains a "double digit team size." "IJR is committed to our mission of elevating trusted voices on all sides, as we've worked towards that mission, we realized that the best way to do that; and fulfill the FIRST pledge we made to our readers, would be in a nonprofit structure," Stuebe wrote in a statement to Mediaite. The new layoffs come more than a year after IJR fired 15 employees. The layoffs coincided with a steep</description>
