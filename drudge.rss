      <title>Republicans decry trial as 'boring'...</title>
      <link>https://www.westport-news.com/news/article/Republicans-decry-impeachment-as-boring-in-an-15004299.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.westport-news.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Republicans adopted a new defense strategy this past week at President Donald Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate: boredom.  A top White House aide called the trial "unwatchable," Trump's campaign manager compared the proceedings to watching paint dry, and several Republican senators entertained distractions while downplaying the three-day prosecution as repetitive and unexciting. "They're really not bringing forth new information," Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said of the House impeachment managers Friday.  "I've not heard anything new," added Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla.  Barrasso and Scott were among 53 Republican senators who voted 10 times last week to block new evidence and witness testimony, effectively stripping the proceedings of potential novelty and allowing Trump's allies to publicly portray the trial as uninteresting and unimportant.  It's a defense strategy aimed at convincing the public that the third impeachment trial in American history is not worth their time while avoiding substantive questions about Trump's alleged misconduct, said Heather Cox Richardson, who teaches history at Boston College.  "It's definitely a strategy to try to get people to not pay attention," she said. "One of the reasons they're saying 'This is stupid and boring' is because they don't want people to watch."  Some lawmakers have openly shown their disdain for the process - reading books, playing with children's toys, filling out crossword puzzles or wandering from the Senate floor as House Democrats made their case for removing Trump from office.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has also taken care to ensure that it makes for unexciting television, at least in terms of production values. Often just one oddly tilted camera angle is used by cameras...</description>
