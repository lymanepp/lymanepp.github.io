      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Mars is about to get its first U.S. visitor in years: a three-legged, one-armed geologist to dig deep and listen for quakes. NASA's InSight makes its grand entrance through the rose-tinted Martian skies on Monday, after a six-month, 300 million-mile (480 million-kilometer) journey. It will be the first American spacecraft to land since the Curiosity rover in 2012 and the first dedicated to exploring underground. NASA is going with a tried-and-true method to get this mechanical miner to the surface of the red planet. Engine firings will slow its final descent and the spacecraft will plop down on its rigid legs, mimicking the landings of earlier successful missions.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Republican U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and her Democratic challenger, Mike Espy, meet for their only debate Tuesday night in a contest where the incumbent's verbal gaffes have dredged up strong emotions about Mississippi's history of racial violence. Senate races rarely gain national attention in this deeply conservative state. But this matchup — the last major race of 2018 midterms — has drawn scrutiny following Hyde-Smith's caught-on-video remarks at separate events about "public hanging" and making it "just a little more difficult" for liberals to vote.</description>

The state's first commercial pot shops are set to open Tuesday in Leicester and Northampton. The stores will be the first to operate on the East Coast of the U.S., and large crowds are expected to gather at both locations. Items for sale will include various strains of marijuana flower, pre-rolled joints and edibles such as brownies and chocolate bars.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOUSTON (AP) — A federal judge barred the Trump administration from refusing asylum to immigrants who cross the southern border illegally. President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on Nov. 9 that said anyone who crossed the southern border between official ports of entry would be ineligible for asylum. As the first of several caravans of migrants have started arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump said an asylum ban was necessary to stop what he's attacked as a national security threat.</description>
