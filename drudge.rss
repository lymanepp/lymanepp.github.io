      <title>La Nina threatens even bigger blazes, storms...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/La-Nina-is-here-threatening-even-bigger-blazes-15556516.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The extreme weather that has hammered California with runaway wildfires and hit Louisiana with its most powerful hurricane in 160 years may be about to get even worse.  La Nina -- a phenomenon that occurs when the surface of the Pacific Ocean cools -- has officially formed, the U.S. Climate Prediction Center said Thursday. It triggers an atmospheric chain reaction that stands to roil weather around the globe, often turning the western U.S. into a tinder box, fueling more powerful hurricanes in the Atlantic and flooding parts of Australia and South America.  "We're already in a bad position, and La Nina puts us in a situation where fire-weather conditions persist into November and possibly even December," said Ryan Truchelut, president of Weather Tiger LLC. "It is exacerbating existing heat and drought issues."  The effects are already evident. Rising temperatures and an extreme mega-drought across the U.S. West are fueling fires from Washington to Arizona. California is having its worst fire season on record, torching an unprecedented 2.5 million acres. And in the Atlantic, a record number tropical storms have formed by September, including Hurricane Laura, which killed more than a dozen people across the Caribbean and the U.S. last month.  The first half of 2020 was already quite hot -- just 0.05 degrees Celsius lower than the record set in 2016, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, North Carolina. The odds are high 2020 will end up in the top five warmest years ever.  Across the 11 Western states, nearly 87% of the landscape was abnormally dry, a slight up tick from a week ago, the U.S. Drought Monitor said Thursday. More than half of California is in drought.  La Nina doesn't just mean more heat. It also raises the chances for a colder winter across the northern U.S. and...</description>

      <title>Dems may not trust results of election if President wins... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/opinion/article/Democrats-may-not-trust-the-results-of-the-15556893.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Concern is rising about what would happen if President Donald Trump loses the November election and refuses to concede, perhaps by claiming victory based on early returns before the mail-in ballots are counted or through some similar maneuver. Would his supporters in this "doomsday scenario" take to the streets and Trump refuse to leave office?  These are real worries. But there's another one that looms almost as large and gets far less attention: Would Democrats and others on the left accept the presidential results as legitimate if Trump wins? There's reason to believe they might not - and there are steps Trump and others could take now to bolster his legitimacy if he wins in November. It starts by making sure we have a fair vote.  It's easy to come up with a scenario where Trump ekes out a narrow victory in states like Georgia and Florida but Democrats blame Georgia voter suppression and the fight to keep former felons from voting in Florida as the reason for Trump's victory. A democracy depends upon the losers believing the election was mostly fair and agreeing to fight another day, rather than engage in protests and attempts to stop an unfairly chosen leader from serving. If one side sees the other side as consistently cheating, the very premise of democracy is undermined.  This year, the grounds for Democrats to fear an illegitimate election have only increased. The coronavirus pandemic has upended normal voting plans. Election officials have faced delays in running primaries and been forced to close or consolidate polling places because of lack of available space and adequate workers - who are often older Americans, the people most susceptible to the novel coronavirus. During the April 7 Wisconsin primary, 175 out of 180 Milwaukee polling places were shuttered after Republicans in the state legislature refused...</description>

      <title>President keeps bragging about imaginary auto plants in swing states...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Trump-keeps-bragging-about-imaginary-auto-plants-15556772.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Many plants are being built right now - auto plants - in Michigan, just like I said. They're being built in Ohio, they're being built in South Carolina, North Carolina, they're being built all over and expanded at a level that we've never seen before. Cause I said to Japan, Germany and others, 'Sorry, you've got to come here and build plants, otherwise we're going to have to make it very tough on you with tariffs.' " - President Donald Trump, remarks on Labor Day, Sept. 7, 2020  - - -  We have documented before the president's "swing-state spin," in which he claims he has achieved great economic success for states that, coincidentally, are necessary for him to achieve an electoral college victory.  According to our database of Trump's false and misleading claims, the president has mentioned Michigan in 120 false claims, Ohio in 94 claims and North Carolina in 68 claims. South Carolina is not a swing state, but it may have a competitive Senate race, so that may be why it slipped into his spiel on Labor Day  It's been a while since we have reviewed these claims in a full fact check. So has anything happened to make Trump's falsehoods any more true?  Essentially, Trump says that under his watch, auto assembly plants have been added at an unprecedented rate in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina and possibly other states - "they're being built all over and expanded at a level that we've never seen before." He attributes this to his jawboning of countries such as Japan and Germany - and his threat of higher tariffs.  So we checked in with the experts at the Center for Automotive Research, a group that assiduously tracks this information.  No surprise. Trump is making stuff up.  Kristin Dziczek, vice president at CAR, said there have been four new auto assembly plants...</description>

      <title>Jobless claims show 'red flag'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/936842/jobless-claims-come-worse-than-forecast-key-red-flag</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The number of Americans filing new jobless claims last week remained unchanged, despite what experts were anticipating. The Labor Department on Thursday said that 884,000 Americans filed first-time jobless claims last week. Since officials also revised the previous week's number of claims up to 884,000, there was no change in the amount of filings. This number came in worse than expected, as economists thought that the filings would decline to about 850,000, CNBC reports. Additionally, The Washington Post's Heather Long identified a 'red flag' in the report: a jump in claims from the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that's primarily for gig workers and those who are self-employed, which 'implies many still can't find steady work.' There were about 839,000 Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims last week, which according to the Post was the 'second straight week that figure marked a significant increase.' Red flag: The jump in unemployment claims is coming mainly from the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program. PUA is mainly for self-employed and gig workers. It implies many still can't find steady work. There were 840k PUA filings last week, up from 748k the week before pic.twitter.com/YhhOkwCHLW â€” Heather Long (@byHeatherLong) September 10, 2020 Last week, the Labor Department had reported that the number of new jobless claims had fallen below one million, but NBC News notes that this was in part because of a change the department made in its methodology. Thursday's number not showing an improvement was, The Wall Street Journal wrote, 'a sign the labor-market recovery is losing steam.' Brendan Morrow</description>

      <title>POLL:  Most want to vote before Election Day, significant shift from previous years...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Most-Americans-plan-to-vote-before-Election-Day-15556659.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - About six in 10 registered voters nationwide say they want to cast their ballots before Election Day, a significant departure from previous years that will force the candidates to reshape how they campaign in the election season's final weeks, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll conducted by Ipsos.  Fear of the coronavirus and doubts about the reliability of mail voting after months of attacks from President Donald Trump are weighing heavily on Americans as they decide how to safely ensure their vote will be counted in this fall's presidential election, according to the survey. In 2016, about 4 in 10 ballots were cast early.  The likely surge in early voting and mail ballots will test election systems nationwide, many of which are ill-prepared to contend with an unprecedented volume of early votes or help voters who are struggling to learn the rules around mail ballots.  Even as more voters want to mail their ballots than in 2016, just over 3 in 10 say they are "very confident" that their vote will be counted accurately if they vote by mail, compared with nearly 7 in 10 who say the same about voting in person on Election Day.  "It's going to be pretty messy," said Michael Hanmer, a government and politics professor at the University of Maryland and the Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement's research director. "I don't have a lot of confidence that things are going to go smoothly. The sheer volume of mail, the number of people who don't know what the rules are and are going to request ballot too late - we're going to see more of those issues come up."  The survey also reveals a sharp racial disparity in perceptions of election integrity, with 71% of Black Americans saying it is easier for White citizens to vote than Black citizens compared to 34% of Whites who believe that to be...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thescore.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans players are discussing a joint demonstration to make a statement on racial injustice and display unity before Thursday night's NFL season opener, sources told NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.One possible idea involves both teams staying in their locker rooms during the national anthem.The situation is still fluid and final plans remain unfinalized, Pelissero adds. Leaders from both clubs involved include Patrick Mahomes, Deshaun Watson, and Kenny Stills.The NFL plans to implement more content addressing social and racial injustice to its Week 1 slate this season and is encouraging players to use their voices.Several teams canceled training camp practices last month in protest of the shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Wisconsin on Aug. 23. Players have been vocal in demonstrations since the incident, and a few prominent Black players discussed sitting out a game to force action.Some NFL players have chosen to stay off the field until after the national anthem in recent years. The league has never disciplined athletes for demonstrating during the anthem, an agreement that remains in place with the NFLPA.</description>

      <title>Stock market detached from economic reality. Reckoning coming?</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/opinion/article/The-stock-market-is-detached-from-economic-15556189.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the stock market surged last week, President Donald Trump was quick to tweet, "The Dow Jones Industrial just closed above 29,000!" The picture changed a bit after the Dow slid 800 points a few days later, largely driven by the poor performance of tech stocks, which continued after Labor Day weekend. But the stock market is a continuing obsession of his. "We have the greatest economy in the world," he said last month, boasting of market gains in the midst of a deep recession caused by the coronavirus.  But it's understandable why the president wants to use the markets as a measure of the economy's health, even as unemployment hovers at 8.4 percent and many businesses remain crippled. Since the start of the year, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index - even following the recent drop - is up 4.3 percent, and the Dow is down a mere 3 percent. If stocks were the sole measure of economic health, you might think the economy is on the mend, perhaps even poised for a breakout.  The president and his supporters are ignoring what former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently forcefully explained: "The stock market isn't the economy. The economy is production and jobs, and there are shortfalls in virtually every sector . . .." Yet how has the stock market remained so resilient in the face of such a severe economic shock? In part, it's because of inequality. Stocks are overwhelmingly owned by the top 1 percent, which means speculation can continue even as more people lost their jobs at the onset of this recession than at any time since the Great Depression.  What's more, measures such as the Dow and S&amp;P 500 reflect only the very largest U.S. companies, which can weather steep slumps in demand in a way that Main Street enterprises can't - while the relief packages Congress passed this spring were better at shielding...</description>

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-tries-to-limit-damage-from-revelations-he-15555290.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump acknowledged Wednesday that he intentionally played down the deadly nature of the rapidly spreading coronavirus last winter as an attempt to avoid a "frenzy," part of an escalating damage-control effort by his top advisers to contain the fallout from a forthcoming book by The Washington Post's Bob Woodward.  Trump's comments came hours after excerpts from the book and audiotapes of some of the 18 separate interviews he conducted with the renowned author were released, fueling a sense of outrage over the president's blunt description of knowing that he was not telling the truth about a virus that has killed nearly 190,000 Americans.  Democrats, led by their presidential nominee Joe Biden, denounced Trump's actions as part of a deliberate effort to lie to the public for his own political purposes when other world leaders took decisive action to warn their people and set those nations on a better path to handling the pandemic.  "He knew and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the American people. He knowingly and willingly lied about the threat it posed to the country for months," Biden said in front of the United Auto Workers training facility in Warren, Mich., where he delivered a speech on a "Made in America" plan for the economy.  Biden called Trump's actions "a life and death betrayal of the American people."  Trump said publicly that he did nothing wrong.  "So the fact is, I'm a cheerleader for this country. I love our country. And I don't want people to be frightened," Trump told reporters at the White House after announcing his potential Supreme Court nominees if he wins reelection. "I don't want to create panic, as you say. And certainly, I'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. We want to show...</description>

      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Trump-says-he-knew-coronavirus-was-deadly-and-15553997.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's head popped up during his top-secret intelligence briefing in the Oval Office on Jan. 28 when the discussion turned to the novel coronavirus outbreak in China.  "This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency," national security adviser Robert O'Brien told Trump, according to a new book by Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward. "This is going to be the roughest thing you face."  Matthew Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser, agreed. He told the president that after reaching contacts in China, it was evident that the world faced a health emergency on par with the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide.  Ten days later, Trump called Woodward and revealed that he thought the situation was far more dire than what he had been saying publicly.  "You just breathe the air and that's how it's passed," Trump said in a Feb. 7 call. "And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flu."  "This is deadly stuff," the president repeated for emphasis.  At that time, Trump was telling the nation that the virus was no worse than a seasonal flu, predicting it would soon disappear, and insisting that the U.S. government had it totally under control. It would be several weeks before he would publicly acknowledge that the virus was no ordinary flu and that it could be transmitted through the air.  Trump admitted to Woodward on March 19 that he deliberately minimized the danger. "I wanted to always play it down," the president said.  Aside from exploring Trump's handling of the pandemic, Woodward's new book, "Rage," covers race relations, diplomacy with North Korea and a range of other issues that have arisen during...</description>

      <title>BERNSTEIN: 'GRAVER THAN WATERGATE'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/936691/carl-bernstein-says-bob-woodwards-revelations-about-trump-are-graver-than-watergate</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carl Bernstein has some strong words for what his former colleague's revelations mean for the Trump presidency and democracy itself. The Washington Post published a preview of Bob Woodward's forthcoming book Rage on Wednesday, in which Trump told Woodward in March that he knew COVID-19 was serious but 'wanted to always play it down.' Six months later, 190,000 people have died in the U.S. from the virus, and Woodward has just revealed Trump's 'homicidal negligence' is to blame, Bernstein told CNN. Bernstein and Woodward famously reported out the Watergate scandal that led to former President Richard Nixon's resignation. But 'the facts here are even graver than in Watergate,' Bernstein continued, because this 'dereliction of duty' has been recorded like never before. 'Thousands and thousands and thousands of people died' because Trump is 'putting his own re-election before the safety, health, and well-being of the people of the United States. We've never had a president who's done anything like this before,' Bernstein said. It's all going to go down as 'one of the great presidential felonies of all time, maybe the greatest presidential felony, and we have the smoking gun tape of the president committing the felony' Bernstein continued.
