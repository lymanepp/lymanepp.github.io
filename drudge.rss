      <title>Zuckerberg security chief on leave amid racism probe...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Zuckerberg-security-chief-placed-on-leave-amid-13910158.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Zuckerberg's personal security chief has been placed on administrative leave amid allegations that he made racist and homophobic remarks about people including the Facebook founder's wife.  Liam Booth allegedly made the remarks about Zuckerberg's wife, Priscilla Chan, and some of the employees at their household, Business Insider reported earlier, citing legal letters from the former household staff. A spokesman for the Zuckerberg and Chan family office said Booth has been placed on leave while an outside law firm investigates. It didn't confirm the precise nature of the allegations published by Business Insider.  "The family office takes complaints of workplace misconduct very seriously," the spokesman told Bloomberg News in an email. "The allegations against Liam Booth were brought to the office's attention for the first time by the Bloom Firm after both former employees had left employment by the family office and engaged legal counsel."  Lisa Bloom of the Bloom Firm confirmed by email that she represents "the two individuals who have raised claims." She declined to identify the people involved or share details on the allegations.  Booth is a former Secret Service officer, according to his LinkedIn profile. He didn't immediately reply to a message outside of U.S. business hours.  Facebook's costs for Zuckerberg's personal protection amounted to $9.96 million in 2018, regulatory filings show. The chief executive officer also gets an additional annual $10 million allowance to cover security expenses for himself and his family.</description>

      <title>Avg millennial net worth $8,000 -- far less than previous generations...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/The-average-millennial-has-an-average-net-worth-13909188.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Millennials are doing far worse financially than generations before them, with student loans, rising rents and higher health care costs pushing the average net worth below $8,000, a new study shows.  The net worth of Americans aged 18 to 35 has dropped 34 percent since 1996, according to research released Thursday by Deloitte, the accounting and professional services giant. This demographic is paying more for education and such basics as food and transportation while incomes have largely flatlined.  "The vast majority of consumers are under tremendous financial pressure," said Kasey Lobaugh, Deloitte's chief retail innovation officer and lead author of the study. "That is particularly true for low-income Americans and millennials."  The growing gap between the nation's wealthiest residents and everybody else, he said, is affecting the way consumers spend.  Education expenses have climbed 65 percent in the past decade. Food costs have jumped 26 percent, health care is up 21 percent, housing jumped 16 percent and transportation rose 11 percent. And there are now expenses that most consumers didn't have to account for 20 years ago, including smartphones and data plans.  Today's 20- and 30-somethings spend about 17 percent of their incomes on education, health care and rent, compared with 12 percent a decade ago, the study found. Discretionary spending, which includes dining out, alcohol and furniture, has remained largely flat, at about 11 percent of total income.  "Only 20 percent of consumers were meaningfully better off in 2017 than they were in 2007, with precious little income left to spend on discretionary retail," the study found.  The findings, researchers say, "debunk many conventional wisdoms about the new-age consumer." Millennials, they contend, are putting off...</description>

      <title>Bye-bye Bolton? </title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Bye-bye-Bolton-13907370.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are far enough into the Trump administration to know how the script usually plays out when a Cabinet officer or high-ranking staffer is on the outs with the president. First, Trump asks everyone within his orbit what he thinks of the imperiled official. Second, reports of Trump's dissatisfaction hit the press. Third, those stories often contain incidents of Trump mocking the official on the chopping block. Fourth, Trump denies everything and claims it to be fake news. Fifth, Trump fires the person.  To be fair, sometimes the script is not that rote. Staffers like Gary Cohn and Don McGahn managed to infuriate the president but depart on their own accord. The same was true of Nikki Haley. Rod Rosenstein managed to wheedle his way back into Trump's good graces. And sometimes the gap between Step Four and Step Five can be long and agonizing. John Kelly was on the outs with Trump for much of 2018 but managed to hang around until December.  This brings us to national security adviser John Bolton. Reports about dissatisfaction with Bolton have been percolating for a while now. As Bolton husbanded control of the national security decision-making process, resentment among other policy principals has grown. There have been multiple accounts of friction between Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that have little to do with policy and everything to do with style. After the failed transition in Venezuela, The Washington Post's Anne Gearan, Josh Dawsey, John Hudson and Seung Min Kim reported, "The president's dissatisfaction has crystallized around national security adviser John Bolton and what Trump has groused is an interventionist stance at odds with his view that the United States should stay out of foreign quagmires."  Now, Bolton faces the dreaded confirmation of Trump dissatisfaction in the form of a Peter Baker and...</description>

      <title>DEMS DIVIDED: COMPROMISE OR CONQUER?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Democrats-are-divided-Compromise-or-conquer-13908460.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A split has emerged among the Democratic presidential candidates over whether the party should aim to work with Republicans or wage war against them, a division stemming from a belief by many rank-and-file Democrats that the GOP has stopped playing by the old rules.  Former vice president Joe Biden repeatedly touts the need to return to an era of bipartisan comity, saying that "compromise is not a dirty word" and predicting that Republicans will have an "epiphany" on bipartisanship after President Donald Trump is out of office.  Others say Biden's view is naive and harks back to an era of bipartisanship that no longer exists, rather than confronting the hardball tactics that have helped Republicans notch big political wins in recent years.  "We're done with two sets of rules, one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a candidate for the presidency, said recently, suggesting that if Democrats win the Senate they should consider eliminating the filibuster rule that requires 60 votes to pass most legislation.  Another Democrat seeking the presidency, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, echoed that sentiment in an interview this week. He cited an Obama-era fiscal deal, engineered in part by Biden and which Bennet argued had ceded too much to the GOP, as "a perfect example of Washington dysfunction masquerading as empty bipartisanship."  The division crystallizes a question that could dominate the Democratic contest and goes to the heart of what the party, and the country, will be in the current era: Do most voters want a president who can bring the nation together or one who will steamroll the other side in what many partisans see as a far-reaching war over culture, ideology and the very definition of American identity?  The party dispute has been underlined by a disagreement among...</description>
