      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Governors across the United States are scrambling to make sure their health care systems have enough respirators to help people diagnosed with the coronavirus, but President Trump surprised them Monday by telling them not wait for the federal government, The New York Times reports. 'Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment â€” try getting it yourselves,' Trump reportedly told the governors during a conference call. He did say the federal government 'will be backing' the states, but, for now, they should try to resolve the issue on their own. 'Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself,' he said. Beyond that, Trump reportedly stayed on course by sounding optimistic amid the pandemic, promising the governors 'we're going to get it remedied and hopefully very quickly.' Trump has invoked some strict travel measures since the outbreak began, but his critics have argued he's been slow to grasp the severity of the situation, leaving the most intense measures to the states.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of the most popular hotels and casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, employing tens of thousands of workers, are shutting down amid the coronavirus pandemic. MGM Resorts International, which owns the Bellagio, MGM Grand, The Mirage, and several other resorts, announced on Sunday it is temporarily suspending operations at all of its Las Vegas properties. Chairman and CEO Jim Murren said the closure is 'for the good of our employees, guests, and communities,' as it is 'now apparent' that the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is 'a public health crisis that requires major collective action if we are to slow its progression.' MGM Resorts will close its casinos on Monday and hotels on Tuesday; the company did not say when it expects operations to resume. There are two confirmed cases of MGM employees with COVID-19: one worked at the Luxor resort and another at the Wet Republic pool at MGM Grand, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Wynn Resorts will also close its Wynn Las Vegas and Encore properties starting Tuesday for two weeks. Caesars Entertainment on Sunday night said it has no plans to close its Nevada casinos and hotels, but is suspending live performances at its properties through March 31.
