      <title>Quantum revolution coming -- and Chinese at forefront...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/The-quantum-revolution-is-coming-and-Chinese-14342081.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHANGHAI - More than a decade ago, Chinese physicist Pan Jian-Wei returned home from Europe to help oversee research into some of the most important technology of the 21st century.  At a conference in Shanghai this summer, Pan and his team offered a rare peek at the work he described as a "revolution."  They spoke of the hacking-resistant communications networks they are building across China, the sensors they are designing to see through smog and around corners, and the prototype computers that may someday smash the computational power of any existing machine.  All the gear is based on quantum technology - an emerging field that could transform information processing and confer big economic and national-security advantages to countries that dominate it. To the dismay of some scientists and officials in the United States, China's formidable investment is helping it catch up with Western research in the field and, in a few areas, pull ahead.  Beijing is pouring billions into research and development and is offering Chinese scientists big perks to return home from Western labs. China's drive has sparked calls for more R&amp;D funding in the United States, and helped trigger concerns in the Trump administration that some types of scientific collaboration with China may be aiding the People's Liberation Army and hurting U.S. interests.  "The United States must be prepared for a future in which its traditional technological predominance faces new, perhaps unprecedented challenges," the Center for a New American Security wrote in a recent report about China's quantum ambitions.  Quantum technology seeks to harness the distinct properties of atoms, photons and electrons to build more powerful tools for processing information.  Last year, China had nearly twice as many patent...</description>

      <title>He's 26 years old but still sees pediatrician: Young adults don't move on...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/He-s-26-years-old-but-still-sees-a-pediatrician-14341430.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Joann Alfonzo, a pediatrician in Freehold, N.J., walked into her office recently she mentally rolled her eyes when she saw her next patient: a 26-year-old car salesman in a suit and tie.  "That's no longer a kid. That's a man," she recalls thinking.  Yet, Alfonzo wasn't that surprised. In the past five years, she has seen the age of her patients rise, as more young adults remain at home and, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, on their parents' health insurance until age 26.  "First it was 21, then 23 and now 26," Alfonzo says. "A lot of them can't afford to live on their own and get their own insurance, or even afford the co-pay. And if insurance is offered at work, there's generally a cost share involved, if insurance is provided at all."  The idea of young adults continuing to see their longtime pediatricians has been around for quite some time - it was a laugh line on "Friends" in its last TV season in 2004. Rachel takes her child to a pediatrician, she sees the child's father, Ross, in the waiting room and realizes he's still a patient.  But these days that's pretty realistic, Alfonzo says. "We have people who have had children, and they still see us, so we're seeing the parents and their children, concurrently," she says.  So when is it time to leave your pediatrician? Talon Manfredini, 22, says he only left his pediatrician, who is a woman, this year because he moved from his family home in New Jersey to begin a new job in Miami.  But he didn't think twice about continuing to see her, even though he'd finished college. "She just felt like a regular doctor," he says. "It didn't feel odd at all or different or weird or anything like that."  Debbie Weinberger DeFrancesco, 41, a regional sales manager for Tyson from Marlboro, N.J., says she continued to see her...</description>

      <title>Two mass murders world apart share common theme: 'Ecofascism'...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Two-mass-murders-a-world-apart-share-a-common-14341707.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before the slaughter of dozens of people in Christchurch, New Zealand and El Paso, Texas this year, the accused gunmen took pains to explain their fury, including their hatred of immigrants. The statements that authorities think the men posted online share another obsession: overpopulation and environmental degradation.  The alleged Christchurch shooter, who is charged with targeting Muslims and killing 51 people in March, declared himself an "eco-fascist" and railed about immigrants' birthrates. The statement linked to the El Paso shooter, who is charged with killing 22 people in a shopping area earlier this month, bemoans water pollution, plastic waste and an American consumer culture that is "creating a massive burden for future generations."  The two mass shootings appear to be extreme examples of ecofascism - what Hampshire College professor emeriti Betsy Hartmann calls "the greening of hate."  Many white supremacists have latched onto environmental themes, drawing connections between the protection of nature and racial exclusion. These ideas have shown themselves to be particularly dangerous when adopted by unstable individuals prone to violence and convinced they must take drastic actions to stave off catastrophe.  The alleged El Paso shooter's document is full of existential despair: "My whole life I have been preparing for a future that currently doesn't exist."  In recent years, the mainstream environmental movement has moved strongly in the direction of social justice - the very opposite of what hate groups seek. Now the leaders of those organizations fear white nationalists are using green messages to lure young people to embrace racist and nativist agendas.  "Hate is always looking for an opportunity to grab hold of something," said Mustafa Santiago Ali, a vice president of the National Wildlife Federation...</description>
