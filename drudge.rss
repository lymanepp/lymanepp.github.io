      <title>Boris threatens to purge rebel party members as Brexit battle heats up...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Britain-s-Johnson-threatens-to-purge-rebel-party-14406878.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LONDON - Prime Minister Boris Johnson sharply raised the stakes in the Brexit fight on Monday, threatening to kick members of Parliament out of the Conservative Party if they don't support his plans to leave the European Union next month.  The move comes as Johnson and his opponents position themselves for a fierce showdown over Brexit on Tuesday when Parliament returns from its summer recess.  A cross-party group of opposition legislators, led by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, plan to introduce legislation to block Britain leaving the E.U. without an agreement in place to regulate trade, border security and other critical issues - the so-called no-deal Brexit.  Most lawmakers in Parliament oppose leaving without an exit plan, something many analysts say could be economically damaging and lead to food and medicine shortages. Johnson has dismissed those predictions as fearmongering.  Conservative rebels reacted angrily to Johnson's threat to force them out of the party, which would mean they could not run as Conservative candidates in future elections. A general election, as soon as the next few weeks, is a possibility if Johnson and his opponents fail to reach agreement over Brexit.  Nick Boles, a former Conservative legislator who quit the party over Brexit, told the BBC that Johnson's tactics meant the party had been "taken over" by the "hard right."  "The Conservative Party has fallen prey to an almost religious obsession with the hardest form of Brexit, which is obviously a Brexit with no deal," he said in a radio interview Monday.  This week's battles in Parliament will also center on Johnson's plan to suspend Parliament for five weeks, starting sometime next week, which will sharply limit the amount of time legislators have to debate the terms of the Oct. 31...</description>

      <title>Anti-fascist rebellion brewing in Pacific Northwest soccer stadiums...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Anti-fascist-rebellion-brewing-in-Pacific-14406190.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The seeds of dissent were visible almost immediately.  Soccer officials had notified the Timbers Army, a fan organization for the team in Portland, Oregon, on the eve of this season that the anti-fascist symbol its members had been waving on a giant banner in the north end of the stadium would no longer be permitted at games. The fan group was not happy, releasing a lengthy critique of Major League Soccer's new rules, and working with team officials for months in meetings to change the rule.  But what began as an internal dispute between the league, the Timbers front office, and the fan group has morphed into a full rebellion in recent weeks.  The symbol, a re-purposed icon from an anti-fascist group, the Iron Front from Nazi-era Germany, has popped up at stadiums around the country. The MLS ban of it has drawn coverage from left-leaning media outlets. And a recent Timbers game became the venue for a nearly stadiumwide protest that saw two rival fan groups join in silence for more than a half-hour before openly flouting the symbol's ban.  How did a simple game - the beautiful game - become the setting for such a heated political struggle?  - - -  The Portland Timbers were incorporated into the MLS in 2010, part of a long wave of expansion for the league that continues today as the sport's popularity grows.  They have attracted a particularly active fan base, embodied most feverishly by the Timbers Army, a supporters group of some 5,200 paying members that makes the stadium's North End its raucous home every game.  The league has made relatively lenient rules in its stadiums a point of pride as it seeks to embrace a more participatory style of fandom that marks soccer in Europe and South America, where the game's foothold is strongest. Compared to many football or baseball...</description>

      <title>Trump aides claim victory, but others see incompetence and intolerance...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Trump-aides-claim-victory-but-others-see-14406249.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - When President Donald Trump presided over the battle tanks and fighter jets, the fireworks and adoring fans on July 4, he couldn't have known that the militaristic "Salute to America" - as well to himself - would end up as the apparent pinnacle of the season.  What followed was what some Trump advisers and allies characterize as a lost summer defined by self-inflicted controversies and squandered opportunities. Trump leveled racist attacks against four congresswomen of color dubbed "the Squad." He derided the majority-black city of Baltimore as "rat and rodent infested." His anti-immigrant rhetoric was echoed in a missive that authorities believe a mass shooting suspect posted. His visits to Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, after shooting massacres in those cities served to divide rather than heal.  Trump's economy also began to falter, with the markets ping-ponging based on the president's erratic behavior. His trade war with China grew more acrimonious. His whipsaw diplomacy at the Group of Seven summit left allies uncertain about American leadership. The president returned from his visit to France in a sour mood, frustrated by what he felt was unfairly negative news coverage of his trip.  The two months between Independence Day and Labor Day offered a fresh and vivid portrait of the president as seen by Trump's critics - incompetent, indecisive, intolerant and ineffective.  White House officials promote the summer of 2019 as one of historic achievement for Trump, offering up a list of more than two dozen accomplishments. But privately, many of the president's advisers and outside allies bemoan what they consider to be a period of missed opportunity and self-sabotage.  In the final lull before the 2020 campaign starts to intensify this fall, Trump could have worked strategically to solidify his position...</description>
