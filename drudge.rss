      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some juicy rematches highlight wild-card weekend, in which, well, just about any of the eight teams advancing wouldn't be a surprise. Seattle beat Dallas early this season, and Baltimore handled the Los Angeles Chargers late. The Colts and Texans split two games. Only the Eagles and Bears didn't face off. "That was a different time of the season," says Seahawks defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr., who played for Dallas. "I think we both were at different places in our growth for the season. I think we're both two different teams right now.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a certain point, the manner in which the best in any field evaluate themselves can't be against other practitioners of that same pursuit. LeBron isn't measured against his contemporaries; he's measured against Jordan. Tiger in his prime was chasing not just Nicklaus, but the limits of golf itself. Here, then, are Mikaela Shiffrin's eight most recent results on the World Cup alpine ski circuit: first, first, first, first, first, fifth, first, second. The gap between Shiffrin and the skier in second place in the World Cup's overall standings, Slovakia's Petra Vlhova, covers the gap between Vlhova and Liechtenstein's Tina Weirather, who is in - get this - 14th.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TOKYO - A bluefin tuna sold for a record $3.1 million at the first auction of the year at Tokyo's new fish market on Saturday, but behind the celebrations hides a worrying tale of overfishing and dwindling stocks. Kiyoshi Kimura, who owns the Sushi Zanmai restaurant chain, paid 333.6 million yen for the 613-lb (278-kg) fish at the first auction of the year, and the first to be held at Tokyo's new Toyosu fish market after last year's the move from the famous Tsukiji market. The price at the predawn auction was nearly 10 times higher than the price paid at last year's auction - albeit for a considerably smaller fish - and roughly double the previous record, also set by Kimura, in 2013.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil's newly inaugurated government ordered military police sent to a violent northeastern state Friday following a wave of attacks on banks, public buildings and vehicles over the past two days. Camilo Santana, the governor of Ceara state, said 45 people had been arrested in connection with the dozens of attacks, which have hit 15 cities in the state, including the capital, Fortaleza. The attacks left the burned shells of cars and buses on streets and badly damaged the entrances to buildings.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. employers went on a hiring spree in December, adding a surprising 312,000 jobs and providing a dose of reassurance about the economy after a turbulent few months on Wall Street. The job gains reported Friday by the Labor Department came despite a trade war with China, a global slowdown and a partial government shutdown now entering its third week. The nation's unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.9 percent last month, but that, too, was considered a positive sign, reflecting an increase in Americans beginning to look for work. And average hourly pay improved 3.2 percent from a year ago.</description>

They had an unusual - and nonnegotiable - request. Delete these tweets, they said. The agents handed over a printout of 60 posts the engineer had fired off to his 48,000 followers. The topics ranged from U.S.-China trade relations to the plight of underground Christians in his coastal province in southeast China. When the engineer didn't comply after 24 hours, he discovered that someone had hacked into his Twitter account - @hesuoge - and deleted its entire history of 11,000 tweets.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump and calls by some Democrats to impeach him (all times local): 2:48 p.m. President Donald Trump says newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan "dishonored herself" when she used profanity to describe him. Speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden, Trump said Friday that he thought Tlaib's comments were "disgraceful." The Michigan Democrat exclaimed at an event late Thursday that Democrats were going to impeach Trump, and used a profanity for him. She didn't back down Friday, tweeting that "I will always speak truth to power." She added the hashtag, "#unapologeticallyMe." Trump, who routinely slings verbal attacks at his critics, said: "I thought her comments were disgraceful" and "disrespectful" to the United States.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Homeland Security has asked the military to provide more help securing the U.S.-Mexico border, a defense official said Friday amid a political standoff over President Donald Trump's demand for more money to build a border wall. The acting secretary of defense, Pat Shanahan, has not decided how to respond to the DHS request, but in the past the Pentagon has provided help when asked. At one point last fall there were nearly 5,900 active-duty troops along the border in Texas, Arizona and California to assist border patrol agents and to erect wire barriers. That number now is about 2,350.</description>
