      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FNC's Steve Hilton interviews Democratic presidential hopeful Marianne Williamson during her time at the Iowa State Fair. Williamson said democracy must be tended to like you would your body or your marriage. "You can't just assume that your democracy is okay because it was okay several decades ago. We are learning, and we are learning it the hard way, that our democracy must be tended to," Williamson said in an interview.  WILLIAMSON: The American revolution is an ongoing process. You can't say I was healthy in 1995 so I don't have to take care of my health anymore. You can't say my body was in shape in 2013 so I don't have to work out anymore. And it turns out, and we're experiencing it now. You can't just assume that your democracy is okay because it was okay several decades ago. We are learning, and we are learning it the hard way, that our democracy must be tended to. If you don't take care of your marriage, don't be surprised that you lose your marriage. If you don't take care of your business, don't be surprised if you lose your business. If you don't take care of your health, don't be surprised if you lose your health. And if you don't care and tend to your democracy, don't go being surprised when all these forces that would assault it are at the door. So it's the 11th hour, but it is not midnight yet.</description>

      <title>PETER BAKER</title>
      <link>https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-baker</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.nytimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, responsible for covering President Trump, the fourth president he has covered. He covered President Obama for The Times and Bill Clinton and George W. Bush for The Washington Post. Mr. Baker joined The Times in 2008 after 20 years at The Post and has written about Mr. Trump since the inception of his administration, through the turmoil inside his White House and the many battles with adversaries outside it. He has written about controversies over a travel ban, the investigation into Russia’s election interference, the firing of the F.B.I. director, legislative struggles over health care and tax cuts and decisions of war and peace in Afghanistan, Syria and North Korea. During his first tour at the White House, Mr. Baker co-authored the Post’s original story breaking the Monica Lewinsky scandal and served as the paper’s lead writer on the impeachment and trial of Mr. Clinton. During his next White House assignment, he covered the travails of Mr. Bush’s second term, from the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina to Supreme Court nomination fights and the economic crisis. During Mr. Obama’s presidency, he covered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the reelection campaign and debates over health care, economics, terrorism and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In between stints at the White House, Mr. Baker and his wife, Susan Glasser, spent four years as Moscow bureau chiefs for The Post, chronicling the rise of Vladimir Putin, the rollback of Russian democracy, the second Chechen war and the terrorist attacks on a theater in Moscow and a school in Beslan. Mr. Baker also covered the early months of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was the first American newspaper journalist to report from rebel-held northern Afghanistan after Sept. 11, 2001, and he spent the next eight months covering the overthrow of the Taliban and the emergence of a new government. He later spent six months in the Middle East, reporting from inside Saddam Hussein's Iraq and around the region before embedding with the United States Marines as they drove toward Baghdad. At The Times, he served briefly as Jerusalem bureau chief. Mr. Baker is the author of five books, most recently</description>

      <title>Bystanders use chairs, milk crate to trap man on stabbing rampage in Sydney...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Significantly-brave-bystanders-use-chairs-and-a-14300265.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The blood-spattered man climbed atop a Mercedes-Benz at a stoplight in downtown Sydney and held a knife in the air. He'd already stabbed one woman at a nearby hotel, police later said, and tried to attack others in the busy commercial district on Tuesday.  That's when a bystander, armed only with a wooden chair, jumped into action. Others quickly helped. Soon, the civilians subdued the attacker, pinning him to the pavement with chairs and a milk crate until police arrived.  "They were significantly brave people," New South Wales Police Superintendent Gavin Wood told reporters at the crime scene. "To approach a person with a mind set of obviously what this person did, with clear evidence of a stabbing previously, these people are heroes."  Police have identified the attacker as Mert Ney, 21, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Authorities told the newspaper they do not consider the attack to be terrorism-related, but they are investigating. Ney had a history of mental health issues, the Morning Herald reported.  "Information was found on him that would suggest he had some ideologies related to terrorism . . . but he has no apparent links to other terrorist organisations," NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told the Morning Herald. "It is not currently classed as a terrorist incident. . . . As investigation continues, we will reassess that."  Ney is now in police custody. The woman stabbed in a hotel is expected to survive, police said, but investigators later found another woman dead in a nearby apartment. They're working to determine if that death is related to the stabbing attack.  It's not yet clear what set off the attack, which Wood called "unprovoked," noting that the attacker "stabbed an innocent woman for no specific reason."  Police first got a call around 2 p.m....</description>

      <title>JFK, O.J., Epstein: Another controversial case for 'celeb pathologist'...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/JFK-O-J-and-now-Epstein-Another-controversial-14300215.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within hours of Jeffrey Epstein's death on Saturday, the internet was awash with conspiracy theories. Though officials said the politically connected financier appeared to have committed suicide in jail while awaiting trial for multiple sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls, skeptics immediately declared he had been murdered and debated which of his powerful acquaintances could have orchestrated the hit. Others insisted, without evidence, that Epstein, 66, wasn't really dead, and instead had been spirited away to an undisclosed location.  All this overheated speculation was par for the course when a high-profile person dies under unusual circumstances - as Michael Baden, the "celebrity pathologist" hired by Epstein's representatives to independently observe his autopsy, knows from firsthand experience.  During his decades-long career, Baden has investigated the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., testified as a defense witness for O.J. Simpson and identified the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. At 85, he estimates that he's performed more than 20,000 autopsies, and he's been hired as a forensic expert for cases involving civil rights activists (Medgar Evers), athletes (Kobe Bryant, Aaron Hernandez) and celebrities (John Belushi). Along the way, he's abandoned the grim confines of city morgues and become a TV personality in his own right, hosting an HBO show and appearing regularly on Fox News. And he's encountered his fair share of stubborn conspiracy theories that refuse to go away.  "The famous and infamous, the celebrated and notorious, do not bleed and die the rest of us do," Baden wrote in the first chapter of his 1989 memoir, "Unnatural Death: Confessions of a Medical Examiner." "They have scenarios, intricately plotted dramas....</description>
