## What the Bible Says About Sin

One of the significant questions in Christian theology is whether merely desiring sinful things is itself sinful, or if sin only occurs when these desires are acted upon. This issue has profound implications for how Christians understand sin, temptation, and personal responsibility. In this blog post, we'll explore the biblical view on this topic, drawing from Scripture and historical theological perspectives, and examining the concepts of ordered versus disordered desires.

### **Understanding the Nature of Sin**

**Sin as More Than Actions**: The Bible teaches that sin is not limited to outward actions but also includes the thoughts and intentions of the heart. Jesus expands on the commandments by addressing the inner life, emphasizing that sin begins within us before it manifests in our actions. In Matthew 5:27-28, Jesus says, "You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart." This highlights that sinful desires themselves are a form of sin, not just their fulfillment in action.

**Ordered vs. Disordered Desires**: In Christian theology, desires are viewed as either ordered or disordered based on whether they align with God’s design. Ordered desires reflect God’s intention for human flourishing—such as the desire for marriage between a man and a woman. Disordered desires deviate from this divine order and are a result of humanity’s fallen nature.

**The Heart as the Source of Sin**: The Bible emphasizes that sin originates in the heart. In Mark 7:21-23, Jesus teaches, "For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality... All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person." This passage underscores that sinful desires, thoughts, and intentions—whether they align with God’s order or not—are themselves sinful and defile a person, even if they are not acted upon.

### **The Difference Between Temptation and Sin**

**Temptation Is Not Sin**: It is crucial to distinguish between temptation and sin. Temptation involves being drawn toward something sinful, but it does not become sin unless one consents to or indulges in it. Hebrews 4:15 illustrates this with Jesus, who "in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin." Experiencing temptation, even when it involves disordered desires, is not sinful in itself.

**The Nature of Temptation**: Temptation, by its very nature, presents an opportunity to sin, but it is also a test of faithfulness. The Bible teaches that temptation can come from various sources—our own sinful nature, the world, or even Satan. James 1:13-14 explains, "When tempted, no one should say, 'God is tempting me.' For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed." This passage clarifies that temptation often arises from our disordered desires, but it is crucial to recognize that being tempted is not the same as sinning.

**Temptation vs. Sinful Desires**: It’s important to note that while temptations often arise from within, these internal temptations are not inherently sinful unless one consents to them. Jesus Himself was tempted, yet remained without sin (Matthew 4:1-11 and Hebrews 4:15). This shows that being tempted is not a sin, but rather how we respond to temptation determines whether it leads to sin.

The distinction lies in the response: when a disordered desire presents itself, it remains a temptation as long as it is resisted. James 1:14-15 explains, "But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death." This progression illustrates how temptation becomes sin only when one consents to, entertains, or nurtures the disordered desire. Instead of yielding, believers are called to "take every thought captive to obey Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:5).

When we consent to or dwell on these desires, they transition from being merely temptations to becoming sinful desires. Jesus highlighted this when He said, "But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matthew 5:28). This teaching underscores that sin is not just about external actions, but also about the state of our hearts and minds.

**The Call to Holiness and Transformation**

**Dying to Disordered Desires**: The New Testament calls believers to die to their sinful desires and live according to the Spirit. Romans 8:13 states, "For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live." This includes putting to death disordered desires through the power of the Holy Spirit. The Christian life involves a continuous struggle to resist and overcome these desires, seeking alignment with God’s ordered purpose.

**Renewing the Mind**: Romans 12:2 urges believers to "be transformed by the renewal of your mind." This transformation involves not only rejecting sinful actions but also allowing God to change our disordered desires and thoughts. As Christians grow in faith, their desires should increasingly reflect God’s order, moving away from what is disordered and towards what is holy and pleasing to God.

**Pursuing Holiness**: 1 Peter 1:14-16 calls Christians to live as obedient children, "not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, as in your ignorance; but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, because it is written, 'Be holy, for I am holy.'" Pursuing holiness means rejecting disordered desires and seeking to live in accordance with God’s order and holiness.

### **Conclusion: A Call to Vigilance and Grace**

The biblical view holds that desiring sinful things is itself sinful when those desires are entertained, nurtured, or consented to. These desires are considered disordered because they deviate from God’s intended plan. Sin is deeply connected to our inner life—our thoughts, desires, and intentions—and not just our outward actions.

However, Christians are not without hope. Through the gospel, believers are given the power to resist and overcome sinful, disordered desires. The church must be vigilant in teaching the seriousness of sin, including the sinfulness of wrongful desires, while also extending the grace of Christ to all who struggle. As believers, we are called to pursue holiness, trusting in the transformative work of the Holy Spirit to renew our minds and hearts.
