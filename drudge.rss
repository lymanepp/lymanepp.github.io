      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst storm of the new year has passed through the Bay Area, but a high surf advisory remains in effect Friday as large waves continue to crash along the coast. Waves between 25 to 35 feet are expected to batter local shores, with "favored locations" expected to see occasional waves exceeding 45 feet, according to the National Weather Service. So far, breaking waves between 17 to 21 feet have been spotted along San Francisco's coastline, along with open ocean waves around 15 feet, said Matt Mehle, a National Weather Service meteorologist. "We're still seeing very high surf impacting the coastline," he said. Visitors taking advantage of the dry weather and heading to Bay Area beaches should stay off of rocks and jetties, Mehle said.</description>

      <title>'WE'LL SEND THE WALL TO THEM': President mailing 100K bricks...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/818635/trump-raising-money-send-fake-bricks-pelosi-schumers-offices</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump is now fundraising off the ongoing government shutdown in the most Trump-y way imaginable. The president's team on Friday launched a new website called Build the Border Wall, which calls for his supporters to donate money in exchange for sending a fake brick to the offices of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). This, the website says, was Trump's very own "brilliant idea," to "make sure Chuck and Nancy have no choice but to listen to the American people." Inbox: For a payment of $20.20, the Trump campaign says they will send a â€œfaux brickâ€� to Pelosi and Schumerâ€™s offices â€œwith facts about the need for border security and an appeal to â€œTEXT â€˜WALLâ€™ to 88022.â€� pic.twitter.com/ycsQ45JzLq â€” Meridith McGraw (@meridithmcgraw) January 18, 2019 Trump's 2020 campaign manager told The Wall Street Journal about the idea just minutes before the fundraising call went out. "Since Chuck and Nancy keep stonewalling the president, we'll send the wall to them, brick by brick, until they agree to secure the border," he said. Donating $20.20 will send a single foam brick, but there are options to send as many as seven bricks for $140. And yes, supporters can choose whether their brick goes to Pelosi or Schumer. This campaign comes in spite of Trump's recent references to his wall as being made out of steel slats. As the government shutdown continues, the Journal reports that Trump has been receiving varying advice from his aides, with some urging him to make a deal for less than $5.7 billions in border wall funding, while others are telling him to hold his ground. But as it looks increasingly unlikely that Trump will be able to build the real border wall, he's apparently hoping a fake one will be the next best thing for his supporters.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOSCOW (AP) — Russia said Friday the Pentagon's new missile defense strategy will trigger an arms race in space and further undermine global stability. The tough Russian statement came in response to the U.S. administration's Missile Defense Review released Thursday during President Donald Trump's visit to the Pentagon. The Pentagon's new strategy calls for a new array of space-based sensors and other high-tech systems to more quickly detect and shoot down incoming missiles. It makes clear that the new defense technologies are needed to counter advanced weapons being developed by Russia and China along with threats from North Korea and Iran.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday canceled her plans to travel by commercial plane to visit U.S. troops in Afghanistan, saying President Donald Trump had caused a security risk by talking about the trip. It was the latest twist in what has become a Washington game of brinkmanship between Pelosi and Trump, playing out against the stalled negotiations over how to end the partial government shutdown. Earlier in the week, Pelosi had asked Trump to reschedule his Jan. 29 State of the Union address, citing security issues at a time when the Homeland Security Department and other agencies remain unfunded.</description>
