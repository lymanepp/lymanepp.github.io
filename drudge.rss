      <title>Silicon Valley getting tougher on President and his supporters over 'hate' ...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Silicon-Valley-is-getting-tougher-on-Trump-and-15400050.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nation's technology industry has begun taking a harder line against hate speech, misinformation and posts that potentially incite violence when made by President Donald Trump and some of his most extreme supporters after years of treating such issues gingerly amid fear of triggering the wrath of the nation's most powerful politician.  The moves, such as labeling false posts by Trump and banishing forums devoted to supporting him after years of policy violations, have taken place across the industry in recent weeks, with actions by Twitter, Reddit, Snapchat, YouTube and the live-streaming platform Twitch.  Even Facebook, which long has given wide latitude in allowing problematic posts by Trump and his followers, on Wednesday closed down a network of more than 100 accounts and pages affiliated with Trump confidante and convicted felon Roger Stone. The action came years after his use of social media first came under the scrutiny of federal investigators and involved issues dating back to 2015 that the company said it had unearthed only recently.  Facebook and the other companies still are stopping well short of establishing the guard rails advocated by Democrats, civil rights groups and independent researchers who study online hate speech and misinformation. Twitter's recent refusal to impose sanctions against Trump for posting a video in which a supporter shouted "white power" underscores the awkward balancing act underway at many technology companies. Trump deleted the post after several hours and pleas from his senior staff. A source familiar with the discussion who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the topic said Twitter did not ask the White House to delete the Tweet.  But the newfound aggressiveness in tackling such issues, however belated and partial, may create a social media landscape...</description>

      <title>DEATHS CLIMB AGAIN...</title>
      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/Virus-s-daily-death-toll-is-on-the-rise-again-15400748.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The daily death toll from America's coronavirus crisis rose sharply this week amid a dramatic surge in confirmed infections across the South and West that has inundated hospitals with ill patients and forced several states to pause or reverse plans to reopen businesses.  Texas, Arizona and South Carolina have all seen their death tolls rise by more than 100 percent in the past four weeks, according to an analysis of state and county health data by The Washington Post. Four more states - Mississippi, Tennessee, California and Louisiana - have seen at least a 10 percent jump in that time span.  "They're starting to tick up," said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "Deaths are a lagging indicator, so we always expected that if they were going to go up, it would take some time."  After mid-April, the daily death toll declined as shutdown orders took effect across the country and the virus curve began to flatten. The low point came July 5, with 217 recorded coronavirus deaths, the lowest toll since March 24, when the pandemic was in its initial upswing.  Since then, amid record-breaking case numbers in several states, the death count has begun to rise, surpassing 800 deaths each of the past four days. Although still below the highs in April and May, when more than 2,000 people per day were regularly dying from the virus, experts warn that the trend could continue to get worse.  "This is just the early wave of a lot of suffering and death. The longer we wait to act aggressively, the harder it's going to be for us to get out of the tailspin," said Ashish Jha, who directs the Harvard Global Health Institute.  The spike in deaths this week remains a small sample.  Nuzzo said she and other public health experts prefer to make judgments...</description>

      <title>Calls mail-in ballots 'dishonest' but absentee ballots 'fine'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/924774/trump-calls-mailin-ballots-dishonest-but-says-absentee-ballots-are-fine-theyre-same-thing</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump's campaign against mail-in voting relies on a fundamental misunderstanding of what the process even is. Even amid a global pandemic that makes it dangerous to gather in public and definitely dangerous to vote in person, Trump has railed against the safer option of mass mail-in voting. He repeated his false claim that mail-in voting is wracked with fraud in a Friday tweet, but then decided 'absentee ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your voting privilege.' There's one big problem with that: Absentee and mail-in ballots are the same thing. ....Absentee Ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your voting privilege. Not so with Mail-Ins. Rigged Election!!! 20% fraudulent ballots? â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2020 Despite what Trump says, getting a ballot by mail â€” an absentee ballot, one might say â€” in most states requires filing an application complete with one's signature. Five states have all-mail elections and haven't faced any major issues or fraud throughout the years. Trump has made this inequivalence between absentee and mail-in voting many times in the past. He's often used it to justify why he has voted by mail many times in the past even when there was no global health threat keeping him from going to the polls. Administration officials have also tried to claim mail-in voting is problematic despite using the process several times themselves. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>25 Covid Cases Linked to Oakland MCDONALD'S...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/Oakland-Mcdonalds-Linked-To-25-Covid-Cases-Is-15398555.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;OAKLAND (BCN)  A McDonald's restaurant in Oakland's Temescal District that has been linked to 25 cases of the novel coronavirus may reopen Sunday but must show it is keeping employees and the public safe from the virus, following a court order on Thursday.  A 10-month-old baby who experienced severe symptoms of COVID-19 was among the employees of this McDonald's and an affiliated restaurant in Berkeley and their family members who have contracted the virus, according to a complaint filed in the case last month.  So far, those diagnosed with COVID-19 include a manager for both stores, 11 workers at the Oakland restaurant, six of their family members and seven workers at the Berkeley store, for a total of 25 linked cases, according to the complaint.  Workers allegedly were discouraged from taking sick leave when they experienced virus symptoms and were not told when their co-workers tested positive. An emergency ordinance in Oakland mandates paid sick leave for many workers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Owners of the McDonald's at 4514 Telegraph Ave., which closed in May after its employees went on strike to protest their working conditions, according to the complaint, face contempt charges if the store backslides, said Michael Rubin of Altshuler Berzon, an attorney for the employees and their families. The Berkeley restaurant is at 1998 Shattuck Ave.  The stores are franchises owned by a Michael Smith, who appears to live in Hayward, and members of his family. The owners must file a brief with the court by July 27 indicating how the Oakland restaurant has complied with the requirements of the restraining order.  Attempts to reach Smith on Thursday were unsuccessful. A spokesperson for McDonald's Corp., which is not a defendant in the case, said the company does not comment on hearings or...</description>

      <title>Fauci says he hasn't briefed president in 2 months...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/924772/fauci-says-hasnt-briefed-trump-covid19-2-months</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump has apparently not been briefed by the country's top infectious disease expert for months, even amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke to the Financial Times in an interview published Friday, in which he revealed that it's been more than a month since he actually saw the president in person at the White House; that last happened on June 2, he said. Additionally, Fauci said that it's been at least two months since he briefed Trump, though he's 'sure' his messages are being relayed to the president. If that's the case, 'Trump is evidently not listening,' the Financial Times writes. After all, Fauci in the interview had to offer a fact-check of Trump's recent false claim that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are harmless. 'I'm trying to figure out where the president got that number,' Fauci said. 'What I think happened is that someone told him that the general mortality is about 1 percent. And he interpreted, therefore, that 99 percent is not a problem, when that's obviously not the case.' Fauci noted that despite Trump's assertion, since COVID-19 has such a 'broad range of manifestations,' 'even if it doesn't kill you, even if it doesn't put you in the hospital, it can make you seriously ill.' It's not just Trump who's been seeing less of Fauci lately, as he's also been making fewer TV appearances in recent weeks as CNN reports the White House has blocked some interview requests with him. Fauci himself seems to have a theory as to why. 'I have a reputation, as you probably have figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things,' Fauci told the Financial Times. 'And that may be one of the reasons why I havenâ€™t been on television very much lately.' Brendan Morrow</description>
