      <title>Young Americans say billionaires do more harm than good, study shows...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Young-Americans-say-billionaires-do-more-harm-15128596.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a time of near-record wealth concentration, more than twice as many young Americans say the existence of billionaires is bad for society as those who say it is good.  According to the Pew Research Center, 39% of adults younger than 30 support the view that people whose personal fortunes exceed $1 billion "is a bad thing," while 16% say billionaires are good for society.  It's worth noting, however, that a plurality of young Americans - 45% - profess indifference either way.  These attitudes were likely sharpened by the Democratic presidential campaign, which at one point pitted a multibillionaire (Mike Bloomberg) against a socialist senator who says that billionaires shouldn't exist (Bernie Sanders) for the right to challenge the billionaire in the White House come November.  "The recent reigning conventional wisdom over the last several decades of what I call the 'Age of Capital' is that [billionaires] are 'up there' because they are smarter than us," said Anand Giridharadas, author of "Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World." But the Pew data, he says, suggest that young Americans are concluding that billionaires have amassed their wealth "through their rigging of the tax code, through legal political bribery, through their tax avoidance in shelters like the Cayman Islands, and through lobbying for public policy that benefits them privately."  The financial situation of young Americans also explains some of their suspicions toward the ultra-wealthy. In 2016, the median household headed by a person younger than 35 had a net worth of about $11,000, which is lower, in real terms, than the net worth of a comparable younger generation in the 1980s. Those smaller nest eggs are due, in part, to things like massive student loan debt owed to the people and institutions at the opposite end of the financial...</description>

      <title>Lag ignites political uproar...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/In-Congress-bipartisan-complaints-to-Trump-15126672.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Concerns about the lagging pace of coronavirus testing have exploded into a major political issue, with lawmakers of both parties angrily demanding more tests for Americans as President Donald Trump has insisted problems that have hindered capacity are being addressed.  The issue dominated separate briefings for members of the House and Senate on Thursday, emerged in the presidential race and became a flash point at a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing, where the country's top public health officials struggled to explain why more Americans could not get tested for a global pandemic.  "The system is not geared toward what we need right now, what you are asking for," Anthony Fauci, an immunologist and the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said at the hearing. "That is a failing. Let's admit it."  At the White House on Thursday, Trump responded to a question about the lack of test availability by claiming that "over the next few days, they're going to have four million tests out."  "Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth," he said. "If you go to the right agency, if you go to the right area, you get the test."  So far, in the United States, only about 11,000 people have been tested, according to figures shared with members of Congress on Thursday. According to statistics compiled by the American Enterprise Institute, nationwide capacity to process the test kits being distributed has so far ramped up only to about 20,000 people per day - meaning it could be weeks before any tested patient gets results.  Members of Trump's party sounded alarms Thursday. After a Senate briefing with Fauci and other officials, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., acknowledged that Trump's recent statement that anyone who wants to get tested can get...</description>

      <title>Rep. Omar marries political consultant, months after affair claim...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/us/article/Ilhan-Omar-announces-new-marriage-months-after-15125718.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota has married a political consultant who worked for her, months after the two were accused of having an affair, which she denied.  A marriage license filed in Washington, D.C., shows Omar married political consultant Tim Mynett on Wednesday. Omar announced her new marriage Wednesday night on Instagram, with a photo of her and a bearded man smiling and displaying wedding rings. "Got married! From partners in politics to life partners, so blessed," the post says, without identifying Mynett by name.  Filings with the Federal Election Commission show Omar's campaign paid Tim Mynett or his firm nearly $600,000 since July 2018. Though it may raise eyebrows, family members, including spouses, can be on the campaign payroll as long as the family member provides services at a fair market value.  Larry Jacobs, a politics professor at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs, said the work needs to be reasonable and there has to be actual work being done.  Jacobs said constituents may question the way Omar handled the situation.  "Remember the story began with her denying a relationship, and now she's marrying that person," Jacobs said. "I think there are legitimate questions that constituents might ask about whether Congresswoman Omar has been fully truthful in her discussion of this relationship, and the nature of her marriage to a previous husband," whom Omar divorced last fall.  A relationship between Omar and Mynett was publicly alleged in August, when Mynett's then-wife, Beth Mynett, filed for divorce and accused her husband and Omar of having an affair. In response, Tim Mynett filed his own court document denying that he told his wife he was in love with Omar and that he was ending his...</description>

      <title>Vast Iranian  burial pits visible from space...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Iran-s-coronavirus-burial-pits-are-so-vast-15125717.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two days after Iran declared its first cases of the novel coronavirus - in what would become one of the largest outbreaks of the illness outside of China - evidence of unusual activity appeared at a cemetery near where the infections emerged.  At the Behesht-e Masoumeh complex in Qom, about 80 miles south of Tehran, the excavation of a new section of the graveyard began as early as Feb. 21, satellite images show, and then rapidly expanded as the virus spread. By the end of the month, two large trenches - their lengths totaling 100 yards - were visible at the site from space.  According to expert analysis, video testimony and official statements, the graves were dug to accommodate the rising number of virus victims in Qom.  Iran, a nation of about 80 million people, has suffered a particularly deadly surge of coronavirus infections, including among its top leadership. Iran's Health Ministry says that 429 people have died of the virus, which causes the disease known as covid-19, and more than 10,000 have fallen ill. Among the dead are members of parliament, a former diplomat and even a senior adviser to the Supreme Leader. At least two dozen other officials, including a vice president, have been infected.  In Qom, the spiritual center of Iran's ruling Shiite clerics, more than 846 people have contracted the virus, officials say. Iran's government has not released an official death toll for Qom, however, where about 1.2 million people live. But videos, satellite images and other open-source data from the cemetery - a vast complex six miles north of the city center - suggest that the number of people struck down by the virus there is significantly higher than the official figure.  A senior imagery analyst at Maxar Technologies in Colorado said the size of the trenches and the speed with which they were excavated together...</description>

      <title>NORWAY SHUTS COUNTRY</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you think things have gotten bad in the United States â€” where St. Patrick's Day parades have been canceled, and the NBA is suspended for the rest of the season â€” just wait until you hear about Norway. Starting Thursday, the small Nordic country announced 'measures that will be the most extensive Norway's population has experienced in peacetime,' and which involve practically shutting down the entire country in order to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, Norwegian Minister of Health and Care Services Bent HÃ¸ie told the national broadcaster, NRK. In addition to kindergartens, child care facilities, schools, and universities closing nationwide, and a ban on both professional and amateur sports â€” measures that have been taken only regionally so far in the U.S. â€” the entire country of Norway is also requiring all hairdressers, massage clinics, gyms, and tattoo parlors to close, Life in Norway and Swedish journalist Peter Imanuelsen report based off the announcement on NRK. Cultural events are also banned, with museums, pools, and libraries additionally closing. While grocery stores will remain open, restaurants, bars, pubs, and nightclubs are required to close if they can't guarantee a three-foot distance between patrons. Buffets, naturally, are banned. Additionally, everyone entering Norway from anywhere other than another Nordic country will be required to be home-quarantined, regardless of symptoms â€” one of the most drastic measures taken in Europe so far. Healthcare professionals are no longer allowed to travel abroad, and the country is encouraging its citizens traveling abroad to return home at once. Oslo-based Twitter user Cathrine Wilhelmsen emphasized that 'Norway is shutting down â€¦ this is serious.' The country faces one of the worst outbreaks in Europe, with some 632 positive cases as of Thursday morning. 'It is extremely important that people follow this advice,' Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said. 'To be able to curb this, we need everyone to come together.' Jeva Lange</description>
