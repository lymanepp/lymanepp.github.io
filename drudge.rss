      <title>New Italian lifestyle upends most basic routines and joys...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Italy-s-coronavirus-lockdown-upends-the-most-15119948.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ROME - Italy on Tuesday was a country in quiet emergency: little chatter, few hugs, few cars, no sports, empty piazzas, vacated restaurants and a deepening sense that a prolonged period of social isolation was the only way to slow the coronavirus.  The Italian government announced more than 10,000 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 631 deaths as of Tuesday evening. There were fewer new cases reported than in previous days, but the new figures show the largest single daily jump in deaths.  The government's historic ordering of a nationwide lockdown - limiting the movement of 60 million people - has transformed Italy into a testing ground for not only what it might take to control the virus, but how much a democracy is willing to upend life's most basic routines and joys.  In Rome on Tuesday, the city was moving at a crawl. People tele-worked or didn't work at all; they wore masks or wrapped scarves around their mouths; they kept a suspicious distance from others. They tried to drop the habits that seemed suddenly dangerous - the kiss greeting; the chat at the cafe counter - even as depression and deep financial pain seemed like unavoidable side-effects of the lockdown.  "I'm mostly sealed indoors," said Ivano Canni, 49, a newsstand owner, describing his sense, building for many other Italians as well, that any social contact carries a risk. "I'm trying to stand two meters apart from others. I open my door to let fresh air in for half an hour or so, then close it back."  Italy's initial response to the coronavirus outbreak had been to try to preserve normalcy and limit the economic sacrifices. But as active cases have accelerated, the approach has changed dramatically, leading to restrictions on movement unprecedented by a democracy and new moves by Italy's neighbors to tighten or close borders.  On the first day of the...</description>

      <title>'10 days from our hospitals getting creamed'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/901251/trumps-former-pandemic-adviser-are-10-days-from-hospitals-getting-creamed</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus are swiftly ballooning across the United States, and President Trump's former Homeland Security Adviser Thomas Bossert says time is running out to control the spread. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who is overseeing one of the country's largest clusters, said 'if you do the math' there could be 64,000 cases of COVID-19 in the Evergreen State by May, while New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the positive cases in the city are 'coming in so intensely now' that public officials are struggling to keep up with them. He said he wasn't in a position to give the media a 'detailed case breakdown' because of the rapidly changing number. That seems to lend credence to Bossert's claim Tuesday that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed. Bossert tells NBC News just now: 'We are 10 days from our hospitals getting creamed.' https://t.co/qvqQSvGKXW â€” Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) March 10, 2020 Bossert, who in his old position coordinated the U.S. response to global pandemics (he was not replaced by Trump, who made cuts to national security), wrote an op-ed published Monday by The Washington Post saying the U.S. should take notes from places like Hong Kong and Singapore, which were able to level off their infection rate thanks to tougher measures early on.

      <title>Israel seals itself off from international travel...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Israel-seals-itself-off-from-international-travel-15120089.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TEL AVIV - The arrival hall of Ben Gurion Airport's Terminal 3 is Israel's front door. On Tuesday, one day after the government instituted some of the most sweeping quarantine requirements in the global fight against coronavirus, it was a door swinging shut.  Daily arrivals had collapsed by two-thirds, according to airport authorities, falling from 65,000 to 22,000. The silence of the normally bustling hall was the harbinger of a building economic hit; Israel's finance minister estimated Monday that the new quarantine restrictions, scheduled to last two weeks, could cost $1.4 billion.  Those few passengers who did trickle through, passing under a flight board riddled with "CANCELED" notices, found themselves subject to a baffling triage, as help-desk staffers and tour guides tried to sort the emergency procedures.  Most passengers were directed straight to their homes for two weeks of self-isolation. A few foreign tourists, delighted to learn they had just made it in under the wire, were allowed to set off sightseeing, still hoping for a normal vacation. Others remained unsure of their fate even as they walked out into the Israeli sun.  "We don't know what's going to happen," said Rhonda Schmidt, arriving with a Canadian church group, aware that their plans to tour the Holy Land could yet land them in two weeks of hotel-room confinement. "They might still shut us down on Thursday."  Benito Linde of Madrid looked up from his cellphone with a harried expression. He had been told one thing by a passport officer and another by his airline.  "I think I have to leave by Thursday," said Linde, a musician who had just arrived on a flight from Madrid to visit friends in Tel Aviv. "They are friends, but I don't think they want me here for two weeks."  The quarantine requirements...</description>

      <title>Secret Service faces unique challenge of protecting president from exposure...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Secret-Service-faces-unique-challenge-of-15118700.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Air Force One touched down near Orlando, Florida, on Monday, and President Donald Trump disembarked, shaking hands with local politicians on the tarmac before heading directly to a rope line where he grasped the outstretched hands of supporters.  It was a routine photo op - but one that has some former Secret Service agents flagging as unsafe and worth scaling back or ending entirely amid the threat of the highly contagious novel coronavirus.  "Forget about rope lines - it's the ultimate threat," said one former agent now serving as a private security consultant who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned about his business. He cited handshaking and airborne particles as the prime ways the illness is transmitted.  The scene on the tarmac illustrated the challenge for the elite federal agency charged with ensuring the safety of Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other U.S. dignitaries as it assesses the unpredictable risk associated with an illness that has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide - including more than 650 confirmed cases in the United States - and killed more than 3,000. The Secret Service is expected to soon begin providing protection for former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.  As Trump mingled with the supporters, his protective detail, dressed in suits and earpieces, clustered tightly around him, with one holding open the door of the presidential limousine nearby in case of an attack. Yet the coronavirus presents a silent, unseen enemy, one whose dangers can be unleashed without ill intent and spread without warning.  In recent days, reports that an attendee of the Conservative Political Action Conference at National Harbor in Maryland tested positive for the virus has led to questions...</description>

      <title>STUDY:  Common artificial sweetener might be making you fatter and sicker...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/A-common-artificial-sweetener-might-be-making-you-15119900.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A study published in the journal Cell Metabolism by a group of Yale researchers found that the consumption of the common artificial sweetener sucralose (which is found in Splenda, Zerocal, Sukrana, SucraPlus and other brands) in combination with carbohydrates can swiftly turn a healthy person into one with high blood sugar.  From whole grain English muffins to reduced-sugar ketchup, sucralose is found in thousands of baked goods, condiments, syrups and other consumer packaged goods - almost all of them containing carbs.  The finding, which researchers noted has yet to be replicated in other studies, raises new questions about the use of artificial sweeteners and their effects on weight gain and overall health.  In the Yale study, researchers took 60 healthy-weight individuals and separated them into three groups: A group that consumed a regular-size beverage containing the equivalent of two packets of sucralose sweetener, a second group that consumed a beverage sweetened with table sugar at the equivalent sweetness, and a third control group that had a beverage with the artificial sweetener as well as a carbohydrate called maltodextrin.  The molecules of maltodextrin don't bind to taste receptors in the mouth and are impossible to detect. While the sensation of the third group's beverage was identical to the Splenda-only group, only this group exhibited significant adverse health effects.  The artificial sweetener by itself seemed to be fine, the researchers discovered, but that changed when combined with a carbohydrate. Seven beverages over two weeks and the previously healthy people in this group became glucose intolerant, a metabolic condition that results in elevated blood glucose levels and puts people at an increased risk for diabetes.  The finding follows a study in...</description>

      <title>STRUGGLES TO CALM NATION</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-struggles-to-calm-nation-after-days-of-15118445.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump confronted one of the most perilous days of his presidency Monday by first erupting in a barrage of commentary that failed to calm the cratering financial markets, struggling to inspire confidence that his administration could stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.  But by the time the sun set in Washington, Trump sounded momentarily chastened by the turbulence and previewed a raft of emergency measures to shore up the economy.  "We have a very strong economy," the president told reporters, "but this blindsided the world."  Responding to days of mounting pressure from Wall Street executives and congressional allies, Trump said he plans to visit the Capitol on Tuesday to advocate for a payroll tax cut and other proposals to provide relief for hourly workers and others affected by the fallout.  Trump, who for weeks has resisted such steps, described the policies at a White House news conference as "very dramatic," before ceding the lectern to Vice President Mike Pence and top public health experts to deliver a coronavirus update.  Trump's overall handling of the converging crises - while spreading misinformation and blaming others - has unsettled many of his Republican allies on Capitol Hill and even inside the White House, where some aides acknowledged that the president is compounding problems with his grievances and conspiratorial mind-set.  The coronavirus and market meltdown present Trump with a challenge unlike any he has faced as president, and one for which he has no ready solution. At a moment when anxious citizens are turning to the government for facts and assurance, Trump is playing down risks and immersing himself in feuds with Democrats, the media and other perceived enemies.  While Pence and other top administration...</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Fears-of-corporate-debt-bomb-grow-as-coronavirus-15119381.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The coronavirus panic could threaten a $10 trillion mountain of corporate debt, unleashing a cycle of layoffs and business spending cuts that would hit the economy just as some analysts are warning of a recession.  Financial markets already are showing major signs of stress. Investors are demanding higher interest payments in return for lending to less creditworthy companies; some businesses are delaying their planned bond sales while they wait for Wall Street to settle down; and ratings agencies are moving toward downgrading some corporate borrowers.  The mammoth debt bulge includes a dramatic increase in borrowing by the lowest quality investment grade firms -- those rated just one level above "junk." More than $1 trillion in "leveraged loans," a type of risky bank lending to debt-laden companies, is a second potential flash point.  Watchdogs including the Federal Reserve have warned for years that excessive borrowing by corporations, including some with subpar credit ratings, might eventually blow a hole in the U.S. economy. Now, as Wall Street wrestles with a global epidemic, the debt alarms show how investors are reassessing risks they overlooked during the long economic expansion.  "It is a big concern," said Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist for Morgan Stanley. "We're dealing with the unknown. But given the enormous increase in leverage, the system is fragile and vulnerable."  Energy companies that have borrowed heavily in recent years may be the first to suffer, due to the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Falling oil prices, while good news for consumers, may reach levels that will make it impossible for companies in the U.S. shale industry to cover their costs.  On Monday, investors battered some energy companies that have big outstanding obligations. Shares of Halliburton, which has more than...</description>
