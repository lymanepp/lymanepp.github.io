      <title>Facing unrest on American streets, Trump turns 'Homeland Security' powers inward... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Facing-unrest-on-American-streets-Trump-turns-15424467.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Portland, the District of Columbia and other U.S. cities shaken by protests in recent months, the Trump administration has leaned on the considerable authority and assets of the Department of Homeland Security - an agency formed to prevent another Sept. 11, 2001, attack - to spearhead the federal response.  Images of militarized Border Patrol agents clubbing protesters and stuffing them into unmarked vehicles have alarmed civil liberties advocates and administration critics, and the displays of government power echo tactics long associated with authoritarian rule.  Legal analysts say that while the department has broad authority to enforce federal laws, officers' actions - especially in Portland, Ore. - seemed to be pushing the boundaries and pulling DHS into a domestic policing role.  "There's a line that it certainly looks like they've crossed. And, if I may, it's an important line because it's the difference between federal law enforcement and a roving commission where you're using these law enforcement officers to go out and restore what they deem to be order," said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.  DHS officials defended their tactics in Portland again Tuesday, saying the department has an obligation to protect government buildings in the city that have been targeted for more than 50 consecutive nights by black-clad protesters shooting fireworks, lobbing projectiles and attempting to set alight the federal courthouse.  Chad Wolf, the acting DHS secretary, said federal agents are not deployed widely across the city and described the situation there as "unique," blaming local officials who have eschewed cooperation with the Trump administration.  DHS agents have been deployed "to protect a symbol of justice - the courthouse," Wolf said. "We mostly do that in a very defensive...</description>

      <title>PELOSI:  'THE TRUMP VIRUS'</title>
      <link>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/07/21/pelosi_america_is_suffering_from_the_trump_virus.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said the nation is suffering from the "Trump virus," or the results of President Trump's handling of the coronavirus. WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: We are following the breaking news on President Trump's first coronavirus media briefing since April. Let's get reaction from the top Democrat in Congress. We are joined by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi, thank you so much for joining us. We have lots to discuss.  But let me start with the President's news conference he just had. He encouraged people to go ahead and wear masks, he admitted that things would get worse before they get better, eventually it will disappear. How far do you think all that goes in addressing this crisis that is still killing hundreds of Americans every single day? SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI: Well, I think with the President's comments today, he recognized the mistakes he has made by now embracing mask-wearing and the recognition this is not a hoax, it is a pandemic that has gotten worse before it will get better because of his inaction. And, in fact, clearly, it is the Trump virus. BLITZER: Well, what do you mean when you say the Trump virus? PELOSI: The Trump virus: if he had said months ago, let's wear masks and let's not - let's socially distance instead of rallies and whatever they were, then more people would have followed his lead. He's the President of the United States. Instead of being a bad example, like a manhood thing not to wear a mask. So, in any event, it was weird because a briefing on the coronavirus should be about science, and that is something the President has ignored. It should be about governance and, now, he's finally embracing - saying it is okay to wear a mask. So, I think a good deal of what we have suffered is clearly the Trump virus. BLITZER: So what you are saying is that thousands of Americans have died because of what the President has done or not done; is that what you are saying? PELOSI: Yeah. Yes, that's what I am saying. I think it's clearly evident. We're approaching four million - we're approaching four million people infected - people affected by this - infected by it, and a large number, like 140,000, who have passed away. If it's important to wear a mask now, it would have been important to wear it in March instead of telling us that by April we would all be going to church together. I wish that were the case, but he had no scientific basis for that.  And so, if they don't return to science and governance - and that's a way that we can overcome this. We have hope and prayers for a vaccine. God-willing that will be soon. But it is still months away and people will die. So, let's hope that the President comes closer to embracing the reality of this pandemic, this Trump virus.</description>

      <title>Bush 'Homeland' chief rips Trump for treating dept like 'president's personal militia'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/926773/former-bush-dhs-secretary-rips-trump-treating-department-like-presidents-personal-militia</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;America's first secretary of homeland security thinks his former department has gotten its mission twisted. The Trump administration has sent federal agents into Portland, Oregon, and has suggested sending them to other cities in what it claims is an attempt to quell violent protests there. But Tom Ridge, a former two-term Republican governor of Pennsylvania who former President George W. Bush tapped as the first DHS head, told Sirius XM host Michael Smerconish on Tuesday that's not what DHS is meant to do. 'The department was established to protect America from the ever-present threat of global terrorism. It was not established to be the presidentâ€™s personal militia,' Ridge said, alluding to the department's creation after the 9/11 attacks. Ridge did say he would 'welcome the opportunity to work with any federal agency to reduce crime or lawlessness in the cities' if he were governor. But 'it would be a cold day in hell before I would consent to an uninvited, unilateral intervention into one of my cities,' he added, specifically calling out how the federal authorities were unwelcome in Portland. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has defended the agents by saying they were stopping 'violent extremists' from destroying property. But the agents, some of them unmarked, have reportedly arrested people off the streets in Portland even if they aren't near federal property or seemingly doing anything criminal.

      <title>Swedes offer grim warning: Don't do things 'the Swedish way'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/926741/dozens-swedish-doctors-scientists-criticize-countrys-coronavirus-approach-grim-oped</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sweden's unique approach to the coronavirus pandemic has drawn a lot of scrutiny from the rest of the world after the country chose to forego the harsh lockdowns enacted by many of its European peers. But now several of the country's own doctors and scientists are speaking out against the strategy in an op-ed published Tuesday by USA Today. The experts warned other nations not to follow the Nordic country's footsteps. 'At the moment, we have set an example for the rest of the world on how not to deal with a deadly infectious disease,' the piece reads. The evidence seems to back up the signees' grim outlook â€” Sweden has a per capita death toll greater than the United States, as well as a raw death toll that is 4.5 times greater than the other four Nordic countries (Iceland, Denmark, Finland, and Norway) combined, the op-ed notes. And the country's fatality rate has also been gaining on Italy, the first European country to be hit hard by COVID-19. The Swedish per capita COVID death rate is now 96% that of Italy. At Memorial Day, it was 73%. Italy had a bad fire and put it out. Sweden has let a small fire fester and end up causing as much damage. https://t.co/YmM5paCTFt â€” Michael Li æ�Žä¹‹æ¨¸ (@mcpli) July 21, 2020 The signees expressed optimism about new medical treatments and vaccines, but until then, they said, don't do things 'the Swedish way.' The same day as the op-ed, a report from the research firm Capital Economics suggested Sweden did weather the economic storm brought on by the virus better than its European counterparts and said the forecasted 1.5 percent drop in GDP this year 'is well above consensus.' However, the report also noted that Sweden was simply 'the best of a bad bunch.' Read the full op-ed at USA Today, as well as more about Sweden's economic situation at Business Insider.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mediaite.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fox News' Tucker Carlson returned from vacation Monday night and ended his program going after the New York Times, saying they will be running "a story about where my family and I live.&amp;quot</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Tucker-Carlson-claimed-the-New-York-Times-planned-15422359.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Monday night, Fox News host Tucker Carlson made a surprising accusation: the New York Times, he said, was trying to endanger him and his family by revealing where they live in an upcoming story. As he lambasted the newspaper on-air, Carlson suggested that his prime-time show could expose the home addresses of the reporter and Times editors.  Within hours, an army of conservative Twitter accounts started publicly posting the address and personal information of the reporter Carlson identified as the story's writer. Many encouraged people to harass the reporter.  In a statement to The Washington Post, a spokesperson for the Times denied Carlson's claims.  "While we do not confirm what may or may not publish in future editions, the Times has not and does not plan to expose any residence of Tucker Carlson's, which Carlson was aware of before tonight's broadcast," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to comment further when asked about the reporter's doxing.  Carlson made the allegation against the Times as he found himself in the middle of a fresh controversy Monday - stemming from a lawsuit filed earlier in the day accusing him, Sean Hannity and other prominent Fox News personalities of sexual misconduct. (The network has denied the allegations.)  Instead of addressing the lawsuit or the recent resignation of his chief writer, who was linked to anonymous blog posts containing racist, homophobic and misogynistic language, Carlson used the final minutes of his first broadcast back from a "long-planned" vacation to take aim at the Times. The newspaper, Carlson alleged, has been "working on a story about where my family and I live" in an effort to intimidate him.  "They hate my politics. They want this show off the air," Carlson told his millions of viewers Monday. "If one of my children gets hurt because of a...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The date wasn't lost on Uruguayans.  After watching the novel coronavirus emerge in China and spread to Europe, the country confirmed its first four cases on Friday the 13th - an apparently ominous opening for a disease that would soon burn a wide path through Latin America.  But in the weeks and months that followed the March 13 diagnoses of four recent travelers from Europe, the nation of 3.4 million would keep the virus in check. Wedged between Brazil, suffering the second-worst outbreak in the world, and Argentina, where infections are now surging, Uruguay has reported just 1,064 cases and 33 deaths - unusually low numbers for a Latin American nation testing widely.  In June, it became the first country in the region to reopen virtually all public schools. It's the only country in Latin America from which the European Union will accept visitors.  Officials and analysts credit stable and united leadership, a robust national health system and a voluntary but broad lockdown for the country's relative success so far.  "People were asked to enjoy their freedom in a responsible way by staying at home," said the renowned Montevideo gastroenterologist Henry Cohen, who serves on a committee of scientists advising the government through the pandemic.  Nearby Paraguay has enjoyed similar success against the coronavirus, reporting 3,748 cases and 33 deaths. Neighboring Brazil, in contrast, has reported more than 2 million cases and over 80,000 deaths - second in both only to the United States. Argentina, with less population density, has confirmed five times as many cases per capita as Paraguay, and eight times as many as Uruguay.  Guillermo Sequera, director of health surveillance in Paraguay's Ministry of Public Health, says the common thread in countries that have been...</description>
