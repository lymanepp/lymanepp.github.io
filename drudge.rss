      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The celestial curtain will be rising soon on a lunar extravaganza. Sunday night, the Earth will slide directly between the moon and the sun, creating a total lunar eclipse. There won't be another until 2021. It will also be the year's first supermoon, when a full moon appears a little bigger and brighter thanks to its slightly closer position.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's up with the partial government shutdown on Day 30: WHAT'S NEW President Donald Trump sought to break the government shutdown impasse Saturday, offering to extend protections for young people brought to the country illegally as children, if Democrats give him $5.7 billion for his long-promised border wall. But Democrats dismissed the offer as non-starter, calling on Trump to re-open the government first. Speaking from the White House, Trump said he was offering a "common-sense compromise both parties should embrace."</description>

The reporter informed Mueller's spokesman, Peter Carr, that he and a colleague had "a story coming stating that Michael Cohen was directed by President Trump himself to lie to Congress about his negotiations related to the Trump Moscow project," according to copies of their emails provided by a BuzzFeed spokesman. Importantly, the reporter made no reference to the special counsel's office specifically or evidence that Mueller's investigators had uncovered.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ORAN, Argentina (AP) — The Vatican received information in 2015 and 2017 that an Argentine bishop close to Pope Francis had taken naked selfies, exhibited "obscene" behavior and had been accused of misconduct with seminarians, his former vicar general told The Associated Press, undermining Vatican claims that allegations of sexual abuse were only made a few months ago. Francis accepted Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta's resignation in August 2017, after priests in the remote northern Argentine diocese of Oran complained about his authoritarian rule and a former vicar, seminary rector and another prelate provided reports to the Vatican alleging abuses of power, inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment of adult seminarians, said the former vicar, the Rev. Juan Jose Manzano.</description>

Masazo Nonaka died in the early hours of Sunday while sleeping at home in Ashoro on Japan's northern main island of Hokkaido, his family said. He died peacefully from natural causes, according to his granddaughter Yuko Nonaka.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LONDON (AP) — British police have spoken with Prince Philip after the husband of Queen Elizabeth II was photographed apparently driving without wearing a seatbelt — just two days after he was involved in a serious car crash. Norfolk Police said late Saturday "suitable words of advice have been given to the driver". The police spoke to Philip after British media on Saturday published a photograph showing Philip, 97, driving a new Land Rover near the royal residence at Sandringham. Police said the advice given to Philip was "in line with our standard response when being made aware of such images showing this type of offence."</description>
