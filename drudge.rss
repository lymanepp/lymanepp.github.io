      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump launched an eight-state campaign blitz on Wednesday, seeking to shore up Senate Republicans and GOP gubernatorial candidates against an onslaught of Democratic surrogates, including entertainment icon Oprah Winfrey. Trump will crisscross the nation, landing him in Senate battlefields such as Indiana, Missouri and Florida along with nail-biter contests for governor in Georgia and Ohio. Winfrey, who offered crucial support to President Barack Obama during his 2008 rise, will campaign Thursday for Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who is attempting to become the nation's first black female governor.</description>

      <title>Obamas to make anti-Trump NETFLIX show...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/804974/obamas-might-make-tv-show-about-disorder-trump-administration-netflix</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is former President Barack Obama about to unleash one long subtweet against his successor in the form of a Netflix show? Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama have acquired the rights to adapt Michael Lewis' book The Fifth Risk as part of their overall deal with Netflix, Deadline reported Wednesday. Lewis' book describes the disorder within the Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy, and Department of Commerce that took place during the transition between the Obama administration to the Trump administration. Many of the new president's appointees were completely unprepared for their jobs and some roles weren't filled at all, the book describes. Deadline reports that the possible series adaptation would be intended to "help people better understand the inner workings of the government." Netflix in May announced a multi-year deal in which the Obamas would produce shows for the streaming platform. At the time, The New York Times reported that Obama did not intend to "wage a public campaign against his successor" with these shows, so either The Fifth Risk won't be as much of a takedown of President Trump as one might initially think, or Obama has changed his mind and decided that a public campaign against Trump might not be such a bad idea after all.
