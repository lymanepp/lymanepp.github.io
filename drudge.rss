      <title>The mystery surrounding Epstein's private island...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-mystery-surrounding-Jeffrey-Epstein-s-private-14090511.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the harbor on St. Thomas, the boat skims eastward across the crystalline Caribbean, takes a turn and there it is: the palm-fringed paradise that was the private redoubt of Jeffrey Epstein.  An American flag on a towering pole flutters in the breeze. A blue-and-white building that resembles a temple sits atop one of the hills. The pool and cabanas are visible in the distance. There's no traffic on the winding dirt roads, no people on the dock or the beach.  It's quiet now on the island of Little St. James. Epstein dubbed it Little St. Jeff's. Locals have other names for it: Pedophile Island and Orgy Island.  This is where Epstein - convicted of sex crimes a decade ago in Florida and now charged in New York with trafficking girls as young as 14 - repaired, his escape from the toil of cultivating the rich and powerful.  Over the years, the 66-year-old crossed paths with former and future presidents, as well as a Who's Who of wealthy business figures and celebrities. On St. Thomas, he has been a subject of lurid speculation for as long as anyone can remember. Tourists still take boats out to get a glimpse of the island, where, according to a former employee, Epstein hosted young women who flew into St. Thomas with him and were ferried over in groups aboard a 38-foot vessel called the "Lady Ghislaine," apparently named for his friend Ghislaine Maxwell.  "It's part of the tour and has been forever," said Kristi Query, owner of Virgin Islands Yacht Charters in Compass Point Marina on St. Thomas, the gateway isle of the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Few here doubt that Epstein is wealthy. He routinely touched down on St. Thomas aboard his private jet before being whisked by helicopter to his 72-acre retreat. He spent many millions after buying it for $7.95 million in 1998, carving roads, planting scores of 40-foot palms, building...</description>

      <title>Cortez wants to ax Homeland Security; Some conservatives didn't want it... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ocasio-Cortez-wants-to-ax-Homeland-Security-some-14089173.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although some activists have urged the government to abolish its immigration enforcement arm, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., came out in favor of eradicating the entire Department of Homeland Security, which is tasked with protecting the country.  The department's creation after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, significantly threatened American civil liberties, Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday on the WNYC podcast "New Yorker Radio Hour." She said she wanted to get rid of Homeland Security, the formation of which she called an "egregious mistake."  "People sounded the alarm back then, that these agencies are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight, and it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies," she told The New Yorker's editor, David Remnick.  Conservative political figures immediately castigated the congresswoman's proposal.  "Moronic, stupid, naive and dumb," former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove said on Fox News.  "Absolute irresponsibility," Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wy., told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner.  The usefulness of the Department of Homeland Security, however, wasn't always lauded on the right. President George W. Bush's administration initially had "zero interest" in creating a new department to protect against terrorism, The Washington Post previously reported. Vice President Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney's father, thought it would needlessly increase the size of government. (Rove served in that administration.)  "Creating a Cabinet post doesn't solve the problem," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in March 2002, according to The Post.  Some members of Congress worried that the White House was concealing the department's true cost to avoid alienating Republicans who opposed the growth of...</description>
