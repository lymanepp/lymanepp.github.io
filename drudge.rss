      <title>Jan. 6 panel hears of 'medieval' Capitol violence by MAGA rioters...</title>
      <link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/police-defended-u-capitol-testify-100228458.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Four police officers delivered wrenching testimony on Tuesday on their struggle to defend the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 against a mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters, describing to lawmakers how they were beaten, taunted with racial insults from rioters and faced threats like "kill him with his own gun." The testimony came as a Democratic-led House of Representatives investigatory committee held its first hearing, with chairman Bennie Thompson and a Republican panel member, Liz Cheney, emphasizing the need for a thorough probe. Thompson and Cheney warned against "whitewashing" the riot even as Trump allies try to downplay the incident and accuse the committee of political motivations.</description>
