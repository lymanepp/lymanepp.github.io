      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — A sudden wave of pipe bombs targeting Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, other prominent Democrats and CNN was thwarted without physical harm, but an anxiety-filled day on Wednesday deepened political tensions and fears two weeks before national midterm elections. None of the bombs detonated as law enforcement took them away for examination and disposal. The first crude bomb to be discovered had been delivered Monday to the suburban New York compound of George Soros, a liberal billionaire and major contributor to Democratic causes. The FBI said an additional package was intended for former Attorney General Eric Holder, but that one ended up at a Florida office of Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, whose return address was on it.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOSINEE, Wis. (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Wisconsin (all times local): 7:55 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's trying to be nice as he criticizes Sen. Tammy Baldwin at a Wisconsin rally following a series of attempted bombings on high-profile Democratic officials and CNN. Trump claimed Wednesday at a rally in Wisconsin that Baldwin is a "radical, far left opponent" who "who wants a socialist takeover of health care." Baldwin is being challenged by Republican Leah Vukmir. Trump says he's holding back his most fiery rhetoric because he's "trying to be nice." Trump opened the rally by calling for a new era of civility in politics following the attempted attacks on former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, CNN and others. And he said those in the political arena must "stop treating political opponents as being morally defective." Trump is in the state campaigning for Republicans, including Gov. Scott Walker.</description>

The department said 14 of the 15 brought to the U.S. for medical testing earlier this year did not present the "constellation" of symptoms suffered by more than two dozen diplomats in Cuba that it blames on mysterious health attacks.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Democrats know something about disappointment. The last time voters chose a governor, the party pinned its hopes on a longshot punchline named Charlie Brown, who was trounced by 30 percentage points. Two years before that, the Democrat who unexpectedly bested a weak primary field for a U.S. Senate seat was promptly disavowed by party leaders for his anti-gay views. Republican Bob Corker won re-election in a blowout.</description>

      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/Could-a-Democrat-win-the-Kansas-governor-s-race-13332002.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kansas is a state entirely controlled by Republicans now and one that voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 by 20 points. And yet in a couple of weeks, voters there could elect a Democrat to be their governor for the first time in eight years - just in time to have a hand in the upcoming redistricting battle that could shape control of the state for the next decade. That there is such a tight race is more a reflection of Republican control of the state for the past eight years than any major shift in conservative Kansas to the left. Kansas has been struggling for years with massive budget shortfalls. Those have cut deep into budgets for roads, schools and hospitals in a way that's hard for the average Kansan to miss.</description>

      <link>https://www.apnews.com/9ec0ccc37af3477c9c6f2e0577484f34</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MILWAUKEE (AP) — Police dogs have always helped their human counterparts through their eyes and nose, and now some of the dogs are getting their own backup — cameras that transmit live video. The devices generally attach to dogs' backs on a vest and transmit video to a handler watching from a screen, possibly on their wrist or around their necks. It's so the officers can better assess what they are up against before they go into a situation. "If we have a really close encounter with armed people it doesn't work out well for anyone," said Shawn Gore, Portland, Oregon, police K-9 officer. "If we can gain distance it gives us lots of options to negotiate and de-escalate."</description>
