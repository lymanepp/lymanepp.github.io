      <title>A lost summer: How President fell short in confronting virus...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-lost-summer-How-Trump-fell-short-in-15469703.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - As the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows is responsible for coordinating the vast executive branch, including its coronavirus response. But in closed-door meetings, he has revealed his skepticism of the two physicians guiding the anti-pandemic effort, Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci, routinely questioning their expertise, according to senior administration officials and other people briefed on the internal discussions.  Meadows no longer holds a daily 8 a.m. meeting that includes health professionals to discuss the raging pandemic. Instead, aides said, he huddles in the mornings with a half-dozen politically oriented aides - and when the virus comes up, their focus is more on how to convince the public that President Donald Trump has the crisis under control, rather than on methodically planning ways to contain it.  During coronavirus meetings, Meadows has repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus that wearing masks helps contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, officials said. He has regularly raised with Fauci and others a range of issues on which he thinks Fauci has been wrong, and he personally monitors the infectious-disease expert's media appearances. When he catches Fauci sounding out of sync with Trump, the chief of staff admonishes the doctor to "stay on message," officials said - and he has impressed upon Fauci, Birx and other public health professionals that they should not opine on restrictions or make policy in the media.  In an interview Saturday, Meadows said he has been appropriately skeptical of information presented to him but disputed that he is anti-science.  "My comments to all of our doctors is that they need to stick with the science, comment on the science and do not become media commentators and opine on what may or may not happen," he said. "I've been consistent from...</description>
