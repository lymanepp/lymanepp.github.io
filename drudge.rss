      <title>Americans embrace wisdom of being 'nobody'...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Americans-embrace-the-wisdom-of-being-nobody-14547616.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The American fascination with celebrity is strong. So strong that, as my Spanish wife has noted, even our serial killers get flattering biopics. ("Ted Bundy - a monster, yes, but what a brilliant, handsome guy!")  The president of the United States rose to public consciousness not through a single minute of public service but rather via reality television. In a world dominated by social media, people increasingly don't even have to do anything to be sought-after public figures - they can be famous simply for being famous, as the saying goes. In 1968, when Andy Warhol predicted a future in which everyone would be world-famous for 15 minutes, it sounded ridiculous; today it sounds increasingly plausible.  And fame is all we really want, isn't it? All the twisted, celebrity-obsessed aspects of American culture and politics are just a mirror of our own unfulfilled desires to be loved and admired by millions, right? Wrong. The truth is that, despite our prurient interest in celebrities, the overwhelming majority of people do not want to be famous, and the minority of people who truly desire fame are abnormal.  Consider the evidence. The think tank Populace has published an important new study that uses data collected by Gallup about what Americans believe constitutes "success." The authors found that most of us believe that other people see fame as central to personal success. Among a nationally representative sample of 5,242 Americans, 92 percent said fame is part of how they think other people define success: "A person is successful if they are rich, have a high-profile career, or are well-known."  But here's the report's really interesting finding: Only 3 percent said that fame is how they themselves define their own personal success. Instead, 97 percent picked this definition: "A person is successful if they have...</description>

      <title>'We are at war'...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/We-are-at-war-8-dead-in-Chile-s-violent-14549736.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It's not about 30 pesos. It's about 30 years."  That was one of the loudest rallying cries coming from protesters in Chile over the weekend, as demonstrations against a transit fare hike erupted into violent clashes over economic inequalities - which many say have been brewing in the three decades since the country's repressive military dictatorship.  Since Friday, clashes between authorities and protesters have resulted in at least eight deaths and hundreds of arrests, as well as looted supermarkets, burning buses, and charred subway stations. The headquarters for an electric company and a major bureau for a national newspaper have both been lit aflame.  For the first time after the end of the Pinochet regime in 1990, the government has called the military onto the streets of Santiago, the country's capital, as that city emerges from its third consecutive night of a government-imposed curfew.  "We are at war against a powerful enemy, willing to use violence with no limits," Chilean President Sebastián Piñera said at a news conference late on Sunday, in comments that only seemed to spark more furor among protesters. He said protesters had only one goal: producing as much harm as possible.  While Piñera said on Saturday he would revert to a metro fare increase, that appears to have done little to satisfy crowds. A state of emergency declared in six cities is expected to expand around the country on Monday.  "This was an economic pressure cooker that's been building for decades, and it exploded," Rodrigo Booth, a professor at the University of Chile, said in an interview with The Washington Post. "This had little to do with public transit. It became a situation about brutal inequality."  Over the past three decades, Chile's neoliberal policies have made it one of South...</description>

      <title>Klobuchar says she's catching on at exactly right time... </title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Amy-Klobuchar-says-she-s-catching-on-at-exactly-14548800.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PANORA, Iowa - Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was in New York, finishing a speech to nearly 26,000 people. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, was on TV, carrying on an unexpected feud with the Democrats' last nominee for president. And Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., was getting a standing ovation from rural Democrats, an hour west of Des Moines, before sharing a story about a man she'd met in New Hampshire.  "He goes up to me, and he whispers: 'Don't say anything, but I voted for Donald Trump,' " Klobuchar recalled. "So I go: 'Don't worry, I won't say anything.' And he goes: 'I'm not going to do it again!' "  Seventy put-upon rural Democrats laughed and burst into applause. "I don't want to overemphasize this," Klobuchar said. "You know a lot of those Trump voters aren't going to change. But there are a segment of them, nearly 10 percent of them, who voted for Barack Obama, then voted for Donald Trump. There are a bunch of them in this state. There are a bunch of counties in this state that voted for Obama, then for Trump. We don't want to leave those counties behind."  Klobuchar, who struggled for attention in the Democratic primary, says this week's debate helped her catch on at exactly the right time. Her town halls are crowded, with staffers running to get more chairs to pack breweries or event centers. She leads the field in local endorsements, especially state legislators, "with more to come," she says. She kicked off her bus tour with the support of Andy McKean, a Republican state legislator who bolted his party six months ago and who pronounced Klobuchar the kind of Democrat who could unite America again.  "If you want to peak in this race," she said after a stop in Waterloo, "you want to peak now, instead of six months before [the caucuses]."  A few other candidates still draw larger crowds, but Klobuchar is going for a...</description>
