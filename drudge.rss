      <title>Dems fear push to stop Bernie would backfire...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Sanders-surge-worries-some-Democrats-but-they-15012763.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Top Democrats are increasingly alarmed that Sen. Bernie Sanders could gain unstoppable momentum from the primary voting that starts next week, but they also fear that any anti-Sanders effort would backfire, and that has sidelined any significant stop-Sanders effort for now.  Even the hint of an organized anti-Sanders movement would risk alienating the Vermont senator's sometimes belligerent supporters and play into claims that the process is "rigged," many Democrats say privately. Democratic House candidates in swing districts say they are nervous about running on the same ticket as Sanders, but they, too, are reluctant to say so publicly.  That's leading some Democratic centrists to warn that the silence carries a risk of waiting until it's too late.  "People need to start taking Bernie pretty seriously - there is a really substantial risk of him becoming unstoppable if he wins these early states by large numbers," said Matt Bennett, vice president of Third Way, a centrist Democratic group.  But despite "some discussions among people wringing their hands," Bennett said, "It's not like our phone is ringing from people saying, 'Let's do something.' "  Third Way blasted out an email to Iowa Democrats on Tuesday saying that Sanders has a "politically toxic background" and "his far left positions will repel swing voters." And Democratic Majority for Israel, a group of pro-Israel Democrats, has reserved $700,000 in television ads that will begin airing Wednesday, apparently the most concerted effort on television so far to attack Sanders.  But those moves remain the exception within the party. Some Democrats say they erred in 2016 by antagonizing Sanders and his supporters, and they are loath to risk doing so again. Others warn that treating Sanders too gently, however, could repeat the Republicans' experience of 2016, when...</description>

      <title>BRITISH AIRWAYS cancels flights.  Will others follow?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/British-Airways-cancels-flights-to-China-over-15012992.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;British Airways canceled all direct flights to and from mainland China, joining a growing cluster of international carriers that have cut their routes as the country confirmed nearly 6,000 cases of coronavirus.  The London-based carrier typically runs one direct flight per day from Heathrow Airport to Beijing and another to Shanghai. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has discouraged anything but essential travel to China, excluding Hong Kong and Macao, and urged against all travel to Hubei province, where the crisis originated. Indirect routes to China via connecting flights were still available on the British Airways website, and the carrier's flights to Hong Kong were not affected.  British Airways' move could put pressure on other airlines as coronavirus spreads around the world. On Tuesday, United Airlines said it would temporarily suspend flights to China between Feb. 1 and Feb. 8 because of a "significant decline in demand." Those changes affect 24 round trips between the United States and Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai.  Seoul Air and Indonesia's Lion Air also suspended all flights to China, and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific said it would cut flights to and from China by at least 50% through the end of March.  American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United extended their change fee waivers through the end of February.  CNBC reported that the White House has told airline executives it is considering suspending flights from China, although it has not yet done so.  Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said screening for the virus at U.S. airports would be expanded.  As of Wednesday morning local time, the death toll had risen to 132 in China, with 5,974 confirmed cases of infection - a day-over-day increase of more than 1,000. The United Arab...</description>

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-defense-team-presents-third-day-of-15010862.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - White House lawyers pleaded with senators Tuesday to acquit President Donald Trump based on "the Constitution and your common sense," concluding their defense even as Senate GOP leaders struggled to block demands for new witnesses that could throw the trial into turmoil.  In a closed-door meeting following closing remarks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told colleagues he doesn't have the votes to block witnesses, according to people familiar with his remarks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe them. Just four GOP senators would have to join with Democrats to produce the majority needed to call witnesses - an outcome McConnell has sought to avoid since it could invite new controversy and draw out the divisive proceedings.  An initial vote to allow witnesses, expected Friday, doesn't ensure witnesses would actually be called, since the Senate would have to subsequently hold separate votes on summoning each individual witness. And Trump's ultimate acquittal still remains all but assured, since a two-thirds vote would be required to remove him in the GOP-run Senate.  But the debate over witnesses has roiled the Senate since the emergence of revelations Sunday from an unpublished book manuscript by former national security adviser John Bolton. In the book Bolton recounts a conversation with Trump in which the president described wanting to withhold military assistance from Ukraine until Kyiv announced investigations into political rivals.  That would make Bolton the first official to provide a firsthand account of the alleged quid pro quo at the heart of House Democrats' abuse of power charge against the president, one of the two articles of impeachment they approved in December. The other charged Trump with obstruction of Congress.  Amid the debate over witnesses, White House...</description>
