      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/lifestyle/article/David-Muir-reflects-on-letting-people-tell-their-14116070.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Muir, 45, is the anchor of ABC's "World News With David Muir" and co-anchor of its newsmagazine, "20/20." Muir has won the Edward R. Murrow Award for his reporting at home and abroad.  - - -  A: I was a total nerd. [Laughs.] I was the kid in the backyard who would be playing with everybody else, but then would excuse myself to go inside to watch the news every night - the local news, and then Peter Jennings.  A: Everybody knew. Which played into that whole nerd status. I even remember trying to guess on Fridays who the Person of the Week was, because oftentimes Peter would provide a clue throughout the newscast.  I started writing to local news reporters in town when I was 13; I remember racing out to the mailbox at the end of the driveway to see if someone had written me back. One of the anchors, who was considered, you know, the Walter Cronkite of my hometown, wrote back. I still have the typewritten letter with that giant newsroom font. The last line said something along the lines of, "Competition in television news is keen. There's always room for the right person. It could be you." After that, I set up a visit at that TV station, and then began interning at 14, carrying the tripods and equipment. I was so happy to be doing that. And to this day I am grateful to those photographers and reporters who let me bum around in the back seat of that cruiser.  A; I think about it every day, to be honest with you. I'm fully aware that when I go upstairs - that same stairwell that Peter [Jennings] took and Charlie [Gibson] took and Diane [Sawyer] took - and walk up to that desk, that I'm having a conversation with America in a very polarized time. And it has evolved quickly into a two-way conversation - through social media and all the tools we have to reach out to the audience and for them to let us know in an instant...</description>

      <title>Beijing takes aim at USA, Taiwan in new military blueprint...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/China-takes-aim-at-U-S-Taiwan-in-new-military-14118706.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIJING - China sharpened its hostility toward the United States and Taiwan in a new high-level report on its future military strategy that accused Washington and its allies of undermining global stability.  Releasing the document on Wednesday, officials of the People's Liberation Army repeatedly warned that Beijing would be willing to deploy military force to assert its claims over Taiwan. The self-ruled island has pulled closer to the Trump administration and agreed this month to buy $2.2 billion in weapons, including M1A2T Abrams tanks and Stinger missiles.  Taiwan's incumbent Democratic Progressive Party favors declaring formal independence from China, a move that could spark confrontation in the Taiwan Strait, one of the world's most heavily militarized flash points. China's navy this month sailed its sole aircraft carrier into the strait in a show of force reminiscent of similar U.S. operations two decades ago that showcased American military dominance in Asia.  "If anyone dares to separate Taiwan from China, the Chinese military would not hesitate to go to war," Chinese military spokesman Wu Qian said as he laid out what officials called a revised national defense policy for "the New Era" - a catchphrase that denotes the imprimatur of China's assertive leader, Xi Jinping.  The military blueprint comes as tensions simmer in the western Pacific and China moves to enforce its strategic aims across the region, including in the disputed South China Sea. Beijing views democratically ruled Taiwan, which separated from the Communist-ruled mainland in 1949, as a renegade province.  Global military competition was rising, with the United States "strengthening its Asia-Pacific military alliances" and engaging in "technological and institutional innovation in pursuit of...</description>

      <title>PETER BAKER</title>
      <link>https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-baker</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.nytimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, responsible for covering President Trump, the fourth president he has covered. He covered President Obama for The Times and Bill Clinton and George W. Bush for The Washington Post. Mr. Baker joined The Times in 2008 after 20 years at The Post and has written about Mr. Trump since the inception of his administration, through the turmoil inside his White House and the many battles with adversaries outside it. He has written about controversies over a travel ban, the investigation into Russia’s election interference, the firing of the F.B.I. director, legislative struggles over health care and tax cuts and decisions of war and peace in Afghanistan, Syria and North Korea. During his first tour at the White House, Mr. Baker co-authored the Post’s original story breaking the Monica Lewinsky scandal and served as the paper’s lead writer on the impeachment and trial of Mr. Clinton. During his next White House assignment, he covered the travails of Mr. Bush’s second term, from the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina to Supreme Court nomination fights and the economic crisis. During Mr. Obama’s presidency, he covered the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the reelection campaign and debates over health care, economics, terrorism and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In between stints at the White House, Mr. Baker and his wife, Susan Glasser, spent four years as Moscow bureau chiefs for The Post, chronicling the rise of Vladimir Putin, the rollback of Russian democracy, the second Chechen war and the terrorist attacks on a theater in Moscow and a school in Beslan. Mr. Baker also covered the early months of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was the first American newspaper journalist to report from rebel-held northern Afghanistan after Sept. 11, 2001, and he spent the next eight months covering the overthrow of the Taliban and the emergence of a new government. He later spent six months in the Middle East, reporting from inside Saddam Hussein's Iraq and around the region before embedding with the United States Marines as they drove toward Baghdad. At The Times, he served briefly as Jerusalem bureau chief. Mr. Baker is the author of five books, most recently</description>

      <title>Horror movie-themed site told readers to 'hunt' gays. Then activist stabbed to death...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/A-horror-movie-themed-website-told-readers-to-14118182.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The frightening Russian website promoted it as a "game" - identify gay people, upload their photos and information to a database and then proceed to hunt them down and torture them, like the gruesome "Saw" movies that inspired the site's name.  The page was blocked in Russia last week, but not before the names of prominent journalists and activists began appearing there. Yelena Grigorieva was among them. The 41-year-old was a fierce advocate for LGBTQ rights, and on Saturday she was found dead near her home in St. Petersburg with eight stab wounds and signs she'd been strangled.  One suspect has been arrested, local media reported.  The grisly attack is the latest in a spate of violence and threats against the gay community in Russia, where in 2013 the government outlawed so-called "gay propaganda" - a ban that a European court later said "reinforced stigma and prejudice and encouraged homophobia."  "This tragedy is yet another painful episode in the ongoing plague of anti-LGBTQ violence and atrocities that have been taking place in Russia and the region," Jay Gilliam, global director of the Human Rights Campaign, told The Washington Post.  Grigorieva's killing prompted protests in Russia's second largest city on Tuesday and demonstrators there connected her death to her activism.  "Yelena was killed because she was not afraid to tell the truth about the subjects that are traditionally silent in Russia and on the country's state TV channels," attendee Marina Ken told the Associated Press.  Grigorieva, who was also active in a number of other causes, regularly received death threats and reported them to the police, who her friends say didn't take them seriously, the Moscow Times reported. Officials at the Human Rights Campaign, which is the largest LGBTQ rights organization...</description>

      <title>Trump vowed millions of immigration arrests in dramatic raids. ICE caught 18 family members....</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/President-Trump-vowed-millions-of-immigration-14117006.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When President Donald Trump vowed to deport "millions" of immigrants from the United States, he was telegraphing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation that targeted migrants with final deportation orders. The real list had about 2,100 families on it, with the goal of deterring Central American migrants from trying to cross the southern border.  The final tally from the operation, according to federal officials: 18 family members were arrested, not enough to fit into a school bus. Immigration officials arrested another 17 undocumented immigrants they encountered in their searches, what are known as collateral arrests.  ICE announced the data Tuesday morning, tucking it into a news conference that included information about worksite enforcement and routine criminal arrests. Aside from the 35 immigrants apprehended in the much-anticipated family operation, immigration agents separately picked up nearly 900 adults - most of them convicted criminals - and delivered more than 3,000 notices to companies nationwide that authorities will audit their records to ensure that workers are in the United States legally.  Acting ICE Director Matthew Albence called the criminal operation successful and said the family operation, Operation Border Resolve, will continue, though the number of arrests were lower than in the past. The first such operation over New Year's weekend in 2016 under the Obama administration led to the arrests of 121 adults and children in Georgia, Texas and North Carolina.  Officials would not say where the arrests were made during the recent operation, nor when the operation took place, and immigration arrests are not public record. Families were not separated during the arrests, Albence said.  Albence said public blowback and publicity surrounding the raids likely dampened their numbers, but he said the...</description>
