      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are moments in every presidential nomination contest when many strategists, donors and activists can more easily explain why each of the candidates can't win the nomination or the presidency rather than which ones can. That this feeling has begun to grip some Democrats at a time when things are going so badly for President Donald Trump, however, is not at all typical.  On paper, the field of candidates running for the Democratic nomination is everything the party's rank and file might hope for. It is big, offering more choices than ever. It is experienced, with candidates from every level of government and beyond. It includes more women and minorities than ever at a time when their voices are redefining the party. It is generationally and geographically diverse.  Yet, to date, there's been little that has given Democrats the confidence that their nomination process will produce a challenger strong enough, appealing enough and politically skilled enough to withstand what will be a brutal general election against a weakened and vulnerable president. Trump's campaign is already running a general election loaded with cash and with months of time to try to shape voters' perceptions of Democrats negatively before their nominee is even selected.  For Democrats, almost everything about the past week should be grounds for optimism about the shape of the political landscape. The litany of things that happened to or were done by the president in just a few days is beyond comprehension, starting with the case that Trump used the powers of his office to try to damage a political opponent that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry in the House.  That case against the president appeared to gain strength, with closed-down testimony on Capitol Hill, and it was helped when acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said...</description>

      <title>Enters key stretch in fragile state...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Trump-s-season-of-weakness-President-who-prizes-14547356.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WEASHINGTON - President Donald Trump, whose paramount concern long has been showing strength, has entered the most challenging stretch of his term, weakened on virtually every front and in danger of being forced from office as the impeachment inquiry intensifies.  Trump now finds himself mired in a season of weakness. Foreign leaders feel emboldened to reject his pleas or contradict him. Officials inside his administration are openly defying his wishes by participating in the impeachment probe. Federal courts have ruled against him. Republican lawmakers are criticizing him. He has lost control over major conservative media organs. And polling shows a growing share of Americans disapprove of his job performance and support his impeachment.  Many of Trump's Republican allies revolted over his decision to withdraw U.S. troops in Syria, which triggered a bloody Turkish invasion that killed Kurdish fighters and civilians.  Trump bragged about sending a "very powerful letter" warning Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan not to invade Syria. "Don't be a fool!" Trump wrote. But Turkish officials leaked word that their leader had thrown the letter in the trash, and Erdogan then took Trump to task for his "lack of respect."  "Are we so weak, and so inept diplomatically, that Turkey forced the hand of the United States of America? Turkey?" Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee, said in a speech Thursday denouncing Trump's Syria decision as "a bloodstain in the annals of American history."  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wrote an op-ed criticizing the pullout, a rare rebuke of Trump.  "America's wars will be 'endless' only if America refuses to win them," he wrote, referencing Trump's frequent argument that his critics want to...</description>
