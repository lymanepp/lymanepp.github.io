      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Drug-dealers-are-peddling-steroids-on-Facebook-14442534.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drug dealers are turning to Facebook and other popular social media sites to peddle steroids, raising more questions about whether the companies are properly policing their platforms.  Those substances, which are illegal without a prescription, are being aggressively sold or marketed through posts and videos on sites including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, according to new research by Internet safety nonprofit Digital Citizens Alliance and cyberintelligence firm GiPEC. During the first half of the year, the researchers say they found more than 100 examples of such pages or posts.  Even as recently as this week, more than a dozen Facebook pages, YouTube videos and an Instagram account were selling or promoting prescription steroid and appearance enhancing drugs were still live on the platforms. After a Washington Post inquiry, the social media companies removed the pages and posts violating their terms of service, which prohibit illegal drug sales.  The posts turn devices into drug dealers, said Tom Galvin, Digital Citizens Alliance executive director. "Parents should know that," he said. Their kids are "gaining access to this online on sites that are mainstream."  The sale of these types of drugs is just the latest example of harmful and illicit content proliferating on social networks, turning the platforms into potentially dangerous places for users. Disinformation, hate speech and illegal sales continue to plague the sites, despite efforts to better moderate content both with thousands of humans and improved algorithms.  Amazon and Google recently were selling firearm and gun accessories on their sites in apparent violation of their own policies. YouTube, Facebook and Twitter played Whac-A-Mole after the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand, when the shooter's video surfaced and proliferated across the...</description>
