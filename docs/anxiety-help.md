Types of Anxiety Disorders
--------------------------

### **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. Individuals experience excessive worry and anxiety most of the time. Anxiety can involve fear around events, situations, and activities. Symptoms can also include restlessness, fatigue, muscle tension, poor concentration, irritability, and insomnia.

### **Panic Disorder**

Panic Disorder involves the presence of panic attacks. The feeling of panic escalates quickly and usually peak in about ten minutes, but can last for hours. Symptoms include feelings of panic, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, shaking, and dizziness. Stressful events can trigger panic attacks, but they can also occur without any apparent trigger.

### Social Anxiety Disorder

Social Anxiety Disorder involves the fear of being judged and embarrassed in social situations. Fears can revolve around public speaking, intimacy, or fears of humiliation or rejections. Social anxiety can be very isolating, making it exceedingly difficult to function in daily life.

### Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviors that are difficult to resist. Obsessions involve persistent and distressing ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images. Compulsions involve repetitive behaviors that only temporarily reduce anxiety.

### Phobias

Phobias are irrational fears that relate to specific objects or situations. Examples of phobias include social anxiety, fear of heights, flying, or driving.
