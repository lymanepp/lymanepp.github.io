Now 66, he compiled a trove of information from years that included the AIDS epidemic and the systemic oppression of gay people in the Deep South. Burns is now among the donors to a nonprofit organization that's gathering information about the hidden history of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, transgender people and others in the Southern United States.</description>
