      <title> In Hollywood, politics pushes way into ratings game... </title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/In-Hollywood-politics-pushes-its-way-into-13195239.php </link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few months after President Donald Trump took office, Lorne Michaels, producer of "The Tonight Show," was in a meeting with fellow television executives when one of them asked him about a threat to the late-night juggernaut. Was he worried that his program could face a ratings swoon because host Jimmy Fallon was much less political than rival Stephen Colbert? Michaels said he wasn't. "He brushed it aside," said a person at the meeting who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about it. "He didn't seem concerned at all. He just said that the pendulum would swing back, and Fallon would be fine." Michaels turned out to be mistaken.</description>

She thought she'd been invited out to celebrate her birthday. Instead, she said, her former pimp crept up from behind and dropped her with a roundhouse punch. Two men heaved her into a car trunk and they were off, forcing the woman to claw for her life in the dark as the vehicle careened along crowded city streets. Her life as a sex worker was dangerous, but now it had turned potentially deadly. Soon police were in pursuit across the Bay Bridge. Minutes later the car would slam into a pole in a fiery, fatal wreck.</description>
