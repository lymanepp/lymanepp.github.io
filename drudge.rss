      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/936551/more-than-half-households-4-largest-cities-struggled-financially-during-pandemic-poll-shows</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's no question the coronavirus pandemic has forced many Americans into financial hardship, but a new NPR/Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health/Robert Wood Johnson Foundation survey provided a clearer picture of the extent of the struggles in the United States' four largest cities. At least half of all households in those cities â€” 53 percent in New York City, 56 percent in Los Angeles, 50 percent in Chicago, and 63 percent in Houston â€” reported facing serious financial problems, including depleted savings, problems paying credit card bills, and affording medical bills. Black and Latino households in all four cities were particularly vulnerable. In New York, 62 percent of Black households and 73 percent of Latino households reported struggles. In Los Angeles those numbers are 52 and 71 percent, respectively, while 69 percent of Black households and 63 percent of Latino households in Chicago have faced the same. And, most drastically, in Houston, 81 percent of Black households and 77 percent of Latino households said their financial issues were serious. Interviews for the poll were conducted online and via telephone between July 1-Aug. 3 among 3,454 adults in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. The overall margin of error was 3.3 percentage points, while it was 5.4 percent for New York, 7.1 percent for Los Angeles, 5.4 percent for Chicago, and 6.3 percent for Houston.

      <title>Thousands evacuated as fires burn through Oregon...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Thousands-evacuated-as-once-in-a-generation-15552873.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As wildfires stretching for thousands of acres ripped through southwestern Oregon late Tuesday, the state's governor declared an emergency and tens of thousands of residents faced mandatory evacuation orders to escape the Almeda Fire, the latest blaze to devastate the region in recent days.  By early Wednesday, the fire was burning its way toward the central neighborhoods of Medford, Ore., a city of 82,000 people, where many have now been forced to flee their homes.  "Pray for Medford," tweeted resident Jeff Carpenter. "We are on fire tonight."  Oregon Gov. Kate Brown's emergency order for Jackson County, which includes Medford, came after the National Weather Service placed all of southwestern Oregon an under an extreme fire danger warning for the first time, according to the Oregon Climate Office. Brown, D, had declared emergencies for three other blazes - the Beachie Creek, Lionshead, and Holiday Farm fires - earlier Tuesday.  Pointing to winds with 25 mph gusts as the catalyst for fueling the fires, the governor, in a news conference, described the weather contributing to the wildfires as "a once-in-a-generation event."  "People's homes, lives &amp; land are at risk," Brown tweeted. "If you are in an evacuation area, please pay close attention &amp; listen to local calls to evacuate - this can save your life &amp; the lives of our firefighters."  Authorities haven't released new information on structural damage or potential injuries in the area.  The Oregon Department of Forestry estimated that the Almeda Fire has now burned 2,500 to 3,000 acres. As of late Tuesday, the fire was at zero percent containment, according to Jackson County Emergency Management.  Also referred to as the Glendower Fire, the blaze started as a brush fire about 14 miles away around Ashland, Ore.,...</description>

      <title>UPDATE: 'MULAN' enters battle DISNEY didn't want...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Mulan-enters-a-battle-Disney-didn-t-want-15552761.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than two decades ago, the release of Disney's animated film "Mulan" did not feel like a geopolitical event. The Western adaptation of an ancient Chinese legend charmed audiences in the United States with its tale of a courageous girl who turns into a heroic warrior. It also cheered some Asian Americans eager for more representation in popular culture. But it was a box office flop in China, where audiences seemed unimpressed by the film's affectations, from a title character who didn't "look" Chinese enough to the strangeness of a sardonic talking dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.  In 2020, the picture is different in more ways than one. China has gone from being a sleeping giant - whose potential market piqued U.S. companies and politicians alike - to a power now locked in tense competition with the United States. And Disney's new live-action reboot of "Mulan," a humorless successor to the more beloved cartoon, is now in the middle of that confrontation. "Mulan" debuted on Disney's streaming platform last Friday, and has already been released in theaters in parts of Asia, with plans to open in China later this week. Activists elsewhere, though, are calling for a global boycott.  The trouble began last year, when Liu Yifei, the film's Chinese-born lead actress, posted on Chinese social media site Weibo in defense of Hong Kong's police cracking down on pro-democracy protesters. It was one of the earlier shots across the bow in a brewing global culture war that has forced U.S. companies and organizations invested in China, from Hollywood to the NBA, to reckon with the widening divide between Beijing and Western governments.  Yet Liu's remarks seem minor when set against what's in the film's closing credits, which offer "special thanks" to eight political entities, including four propaganda departments and a public...</description>
