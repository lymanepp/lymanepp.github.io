      <title>Susan Rice advantage: Long work history with Joe...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Susan-Rice-s-advantage-A-long-work-history-with-15433160.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON --- In the Oval Office many mornings, as Joe Biden sat in a chair nextto President Barack Obama, Susan Rice would take her usual spot on a nearby couch and brief them on sensitive national security issues. At other times in the Situation Room, Rice and Biden would sit directly across the table from one another, according to people with knowledge of the setup.  As vice president, Biden would pop into Rice's neighboring office in the White House for some light banter with the national security adviser - or heavier talk about the difficult issues confronting the Obama administration.  Years later, that relationship has made Rice an unlikely finalist to become Biden's running mate and the first African American woman on a major party ticket, according to people with knowledge of the process and other Biden allies. She has never been elected to political office but has a credential none of her rivals can boast: a lengthy history as Biden's colleague at the highest levels of government.  "Biden spent years essentially beginning his day with a briefing from Susan Rice," said former Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. "So he definitely knows her."  Biden has frequently said he is looking for a running mate with whom he is "simpatico" and that he aspires to re-create the dynamic he shared with Obama, to whom he was a friend and adviser. That could cut both ways for Rice, who disagreed with Biden on some key foreign policy issues during Obama's first term, when she served as U.N. ambassador, but also forged a kinship with him, particularly once she moved to the White House in 2013, according to colleagues.  Rice has been a frequent guest on television news shows in recent months, impressing Biden allies who were unsure how she would fare under heightened public scrutiny. To broaden her public persona...</description>

      <title>If Taylor Swift album drops in pandemic, does it make sound? </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/entertainment/article/If-a-Taylor-Swift-album-drops-in-a-pandemic-does-15432249.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The freakiest thing about Taylor Swift's never-freaky music is how politely it trespasses on your brain tissue. It doesn't really matter where your head is at. With an automatic omnipresence - in restaurants, rideshares, retail spaces and everywhere else we do our everyday things - her biggest songs literally change the world.  Maybe not this time. The tiniest perk of pandemic life is that we actually have the luxury of choosing whether or not to invite Swift's eighth album, "Folklore," into our lives. And Swift knows it. Presenting herself as a gracious guest rather than an imminent ubiquity, she's made the quietest, most sophisticated album of her career.  That might not be saying a lot, considering how Swift spent her twenties blasting the planet with melodic confetti, but at least "Folklore" isn't the predictable girl-and-guitar-quarantined-in-Nashville album that it could have been. Instead, these spartan pop ballads sound as if they were written entirely on Swift's terms, artfully co-produced by Aaron Dessner, (who makes hygienic rock-like music in the National) and Jack Antonoff (who also recently helped Lana Del Rey make her greatest album by staying out of the way). Don't let the negligible duet with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver distract you, either. The triumph of "Folklore" isn't that Swift has suddenly become tasteful and tuned-in. Having so thoroughly crashed the pop charts like a fluorescent tidal wave, she's finally making enough space in her music for her modest voice to sound like itself.  "I've never been a natural," she asserts with paradoxical ease during "Mirrorball," a declaration of self-awareness that aptly makes the room spin. "All I do is try, try, try ... I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me." Her voice is plain and true, vulnerable but steady, and nothing can pull your ears...</description>
