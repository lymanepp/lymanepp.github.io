      <title>Obama tells candidates to ease off talk of revolution... </title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Obama-tells-Democratic-candidates-to-ease-off-14839299.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Former president Barack Obama on Friday urged Democrats running for the White House not to lurch too far left in their pursuit of the nomination, while at the same time seeking to quell concerns in the party about its 2020 hopefuls and the messy primary season to come.  The comments - made in Washington at a meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a powerful network of liberal donors - marked some of Obama's most pointed words yet about a fluid primary in which he is not picking sides. They echoed previous comments in which he warned about the dangers of pursuing purity and rigidity in politics.  "This is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement," Obama said. "They like seeing things improved. But the average American doesn't think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it. And I think it's important for us not to lose sight of that."  Obama did not name any candidates. But some Democrats associate the characteristics he described with Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., staunch liberal candidates advocating sweeping change who are running near the top of the polls.  Beyond those two candidates, the contest has often been dominated by a discussion of ideas that were long seen as untenable, even in Democratic circles. Candidates have called for mandatory buybacks of certain firearms, decriminalizing border crossings and forgiving most or all student debt. In some cases, the proposals have come at a cost of tens of trillions of dollars, vast sums of money that would dwarf what Obama's administration spent and require historically steep tax increases on wealthy Americans. While some voters and activists have cheered this trend, President Donald Trump and his allies have been eager to highlight these themes.  However, Obama also warned...</description>
