      <title>Robot aims to keep peace between drivers, cops...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/This-robot-aims-to-keep-the-peace-between-13844425.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years, Reuben Brewer had been reading tragic news reports about police officers and motorists being killed and injured during traffic stops gone awry.  The root of the problem, he eventually realized, was fear, the powerful, anticipatory anxiety that can overwhelm a hyper-vigilant officer or cause a motorist to behave in ways that arouse suspicion, leading to a violent encounter.  Brewer knew he couldn't take guns from people who shouldn't wield them or single-handedly remove poorly trained police officers from American streets, but he wondered if there was a way to lower the temperature of everyday encounters between jittery police officers and the large numbers of drivers who fear for their lives each time police lights flash in their rearview mirror.  After 16 months of research and development, Brewer - a senior robotics researcher at the nonprofit SRI International in Menlo Park, California - has unveiled his solution: a robot that allows police officers to conduct traffic stops without leaving the safety of their vehicle.  "The main advantage of a robot over a human is that physical danger no longer matters," Brewer wrote after being reached by email. "The robot is purely defensive, so it can't hurt the motorist. If the motorist damages the robot, it's only money to replace it."  "People are more dangerous when they're scared, so the goal is to remove the possibility of being physically hurt so that they're less scared and less dangerous," he added.  Police officers make more than 50,000 traffic stops each day, according to The Stanford Open Policing Project, an effort that has tracked more than 200 million stops in recent years and found significant disparities in policing.  A survey released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2014 found that black motorists...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getty Images / Thomas Peter-Pool    The US-China trade war has dramatically escalated over the past few days, with both sides announcing tariff increases on billions of dollars' worth of each other's goods.   Chinese state media - which functions as a Communist Party mouthpiece - issued a series of rabble-rousing statements on Monday accusing the US of "greed and arrogance" and calling for a "people's war" against it.   President Donald Trump's administration on Monday night threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25% on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.   If such tariffs were to be imposed, almost all Chinese imports to the US would be subject to tariffs.   Trump tweeted on Tuesday that his "respect and friendship" with Chinese President Xi Jinping was "unlimited" but that "this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn't make any sense."   Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .   The US-China trade war continues to heat up, with Beijing calling for a "people's war" against Washington and President Donald Trump threatening to impose tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.
