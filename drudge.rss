      <title>FAA aims to reset standards for plane seats, but tests are disputed...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/FAA-aims-to-reset-standards-for-planes-seats-14869499.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a special center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, researchers from the Federal Aviation Administration are running a series of drills that could affect the comfort and safety of millions of airplane passengers.  More than 700 residents have been recruited to help determine whether the space between airplane seats or the size of the seats affects their ability to evacuate an aircraft.  The drills mark the first time the FAA is examining whether the trend toward smaller seats and less personal space on today's planes poses safety risks to those aboard in the event of an emergency.  But consumer advocates and lawmakers are worried that the results of the tests are flawed, because the people the agency recruited don't reflect the demographics of today's flying public.  The FAA said the pool of volunteers includes adults between 18 and 60. Lawmakers and consumer advocates note that there are no children or travelers with disabilities. The pool also does not include animals, which are a growing presence in today's cabins, said Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn.  "You've got to have a representative sample," Cohen said. "This is supposed to be a scientific study, but it's flawed from the get-go."  An FAA spokesman declined to address concerns about the demographics of the test pool.  The issue is of keen interest for Cohen, a frequent traveler. He, along with Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., co-wrote the provision in the 2018 FAA reauthorization bill that required the agency conduct these exercises as part of the push to set minimum standards for seat size and pitch.  There are no federal rules regarding seat size. Manufacturers, however, must demonstrate that there is enough space to allow passengers to evacuate the aircraft in 90 seconds or less.  "The testing is a research project, following...</description>

      <title>PRESSURE:  As flu sacks eight Patriots, kicker Nick Folk is out after appendectomy...</title>
      <link>https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/As-flu-sacks-eight-Patriots-kicker-Nick-Folk-is-14869306.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.houstonchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The New England Patriots were scrambling, losing their kicker and picking up a little something besides a victory in the chilly rain last week as they prepared for a prime time game Sunday. Kicker Nick Folk will miss the game after having an appendectomy Thursday morning and eight players - five of whom are starters - missed practice Wednesday because of "flulike symptoms." Missing were defensive starters Patrick Chung, Stephon Gilmore, Dont'a Hightower and Jamie Collins Sr., and offensive lineman Isaiah Wynn. Also out were cornerback Joejuan Williams, running back Damien Harris and tight end Ryan Izzo. Offensive tackle Marcus Cannon was limited after being sick last week. "This is probably, for me, in my 10 years here, the most guys I've seen just be gone from being sick," safety Devin McCourty said, according to the Boston Herald. "No injuries or anything, we just had guys come in and you look in their eyes and you could just tell they were just out of it. Hopefully a day at home and meds and rest can help guys out." The bug's origin isn't clear. In the days leading up to last week game, which the Patriots won, 13-9, on a rainy, windy and chilly night, the Cowboys were battling a flu bug and Cannon had been ailing for 48 hours before that game. "We're all working together on this - the player, the medical staff and the coaching staff. Unless the player is cleared medically, there's no conversation to be had," Coach Bill Belichick said. "If the player is cleared medically, then it enters into some element of a coaching, player conversation. As I said, each one is different, and we just try to do the best we can." The Patriots planned to practice Thursday and again Friday before flying to Houston on Saturday. "It's going around, but we've just got to live a healthy lifestyle," wide receiver Phillip Dorsett said....</description>

      <title>Nixon went quietly. Would Trump? </title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Nixon-went-quietly-Would-Trump-14869452.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fervent anti-Trumpers recall the scene the way the faithful venerate The Annunciation.  On Aug. 7, 1974, Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona led a small delegation of GOP congressional leaders to the Oval Office to tell President Richard Nixon that he no longer had enough support to survive an impeachment trial in the Senate. Multiple books have replayed the storied moment: the curmudgeonly Goldwater sitting opposite the president's desk; House Republican leader John Rhodes sitting to one side; Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott to the other. It became received wisdom that the trio's visitation altered history. After all, Nixon announced his resignation the next day.  In reality, Nixon didn't need to be persuaded. When he met with Goldwater and Co., Nixon had already decided to resign (he was a good vote counter). The senators, as it turned out, never actually used the word "resign." Instead, they told the president, he had lost his party's support. It's true what they say about the Oval Office; not even giant killers speak their minds in that haunted room.  Nonetheless, we can wonder what it would take to make history, in effect, repeat itself. What would compel President Donald Trump's own party to show him the door?  The answer, it appears, is nothing. The Republicans are even more dug in on Trump than they were on Nixon. It could happen - but only if congressional leaders are willing to risk a true constitutional crisis.  Right now, Democratic leaders seem intent on a quick process: impeachment in the House before Christmas and a trial in the Senate sometime in the next few months. House leaders believe they have enough evidence to impeach the president. Finding enough Republicans to convict him in the Senate by a two-thirds vote looks impossible.  Or so it appears with the...</description>
