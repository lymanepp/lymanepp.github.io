      <title>Can posture devices pull you out of constant slump?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/article/Can-these-posture-devices-pull-you-out-of-your-14482655.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like a lot of people, I spend much of my workday staring at various screens - and, like a lot of people, I have the back and neck issues to prove it. Hunching and its associated symptoms are a hallmark of the digital age. Though I have a makeshift ergonomic setup in my home office, I often catch myself with my chin jutting forward as I lean toward my laptop - despite the fact that I'm a regular Pilates student and former yoga teacher.  Clearly, my athletic training hasn't done enough to reinforce good habits. So, searching for a path to better posture, I spoke with two doctors about the problem and tried a few gadgets that promised to help me straighten things out.  "We get into this stooped posture to get our faces close to the screen, which puts a lot of unnatural stress on the cervical spine," says Kaliq Chang, a double board-certified physician in interventional pain management and anesthesiology with Atlantic Spine Center in West Orange, New Jersey. Ideally, when you're sitting at your desk in front of a computer monitor, "You're meant to have the weight of your head situated over your neck in a manner that forces your chest out and your shoulders back, which requires having a monitor close to eye level," Chang says.  When you hunch forward, whether at your desk or looking at your phone on the couch, the muscles in your neck and back extend while the ones in the front contract; over time, this can create an imbalance where they pull on one another unevenly. The effect would be minimal if we were only putting our necks and backs in awkward positions for minutes at a time, but people often spend hours out of whack.  "That's where the problem lies," says Charla Fischer, an orthopedic surgeon at New York University's Langone Spine Center. When muscles are stretched in uncomfortable ways for prolonged periods of time,...</description>
