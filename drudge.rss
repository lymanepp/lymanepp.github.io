      <title>POLL SHOCK:  6 Dem candidates beating Trump in Texas? </title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/864097/6-democratic-candidates-are-beating-trump-new-texas-poll</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump might not want to look at a new poll conducted by Univision and the University of Houston. The survey shows six Democratic presidential candidates leading the incumbent in Texas. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has the healthiest lead over Trump â€” a 48 percent to 42 percent edge. Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden has Trump beat 47 percent to 43 percent, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is ahead 44 percent to 42 percent. Those three, frequently considered the front-runners in the Democratic primaries, don't come as a huge surprise, but Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) also hold slight advantages. Former Housing Secretary and homegrown Texan JuliÃ¡n Castro is the sixth candidate that Texas would seemingly support over Trump; he has a three point lead over the commander-in-chief. Those are the only six candidates highlighted in the survey for this particular question. Oddly, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) is not pitted against Trump, though among the Democratic candidates, he finished second only to Biden in the survey, and led all other candidates by seven points or more among Texas Latinx voters. So it appears the El Paso native is doing pretty well in his home state at the moment. POTUS poll among Texas Latinos:Beto 26%Biden 19%Bernie 16%Castro 13%Warren 6%Kamala 3%https://t.co/ROJef2Jry5 pic.twitter.com/6CUb55QlXD â€” Conor Sen (@conorsen) September 10, 2019 The poll also revealed that 40 percent of voters would vote for any Democratic candidate over Trump, compared to just 33 percent who are committed to voting for the president. The poll was conducted between Aug. 31 and Sept. 6 on the phone and online. It consisted of 1,004 voters and the margin of error was 3.1 percent. See the full results here.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BAGHDAD (AP) - The U.S.-led coalition says American warplanes have dropped 36,000 kilograms (40 tons) of bombs on an Island in the Tigris River "infested" with members of the Islamic State group.  The coalition said F15 and F35 warplanes took part in the bombing on Qanus Island in the central province of Salaheddine, north of the capital Baghdad.  Tuesday's attack is part of operations carried out by Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition against IS, which was defeated in Iraq in 2017.  IS sleeper cells have since carried out deadly bombings in Iraq.  IS controlled large swathes of Syria and Iraq where they declared a caliphate in 2014.  A video released by the military showed massive explosions creating mushroom clouds billowing from the island that appeared to have been subjected to carpet bombing.</description>
