      <link>https://apnews.com/46d8b63388934599b417ab0eeeb0dabc</link>

Left behind were stocks in more staid industries, even if they looked like better bargains by several measures.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The mail-bomb scare widened Thursday as law enforcement officials seized three more suspicious packages — two addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden and one to actor Robert De Niro — and said they were similar to crude pipe bombs sent to former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and CNN. None of the devices exploded, and no one was injured. But the packages, sent to prominent Democrats critical of President Donald Trump, heightened nationwide tensions and fears two weeks before major congressional midterm elections.</description>

The group, many with children and even pushing toddlers in strollers, planned to depart Mapastepec at dawn Thursday with more than 1,000 miles still to go before they reach the U.S. border. But in recent days a few hundred have accepted government offers to bus them back to their home countries.</description>

      <link>https://www.apnews.com/8602ba97298a47b88439b4922d96bd6c</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Investigators examining the explosive devices sent to high-profile targets in Washington and New York will be working to glean forensic clues to help identify who sent them, gathering fingerprints and DNA evidence while tracking the origin of the packages and the components used to make the bombs. Larry Johnson, a former head of criminal investigations for the U.S. Secret Service who also served as a special agent in charge of the presidential protective detail, said that bomb makers usually leave evidence behind. "If there is a human involved, there is a high probability you're going to get somewhere investigatively," he said. "There will be no stone left unturned."</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — A sudden wave of pipe bombs targeting Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, other prominent Democrats and CNN was thwarted without physical harm, but an anxiety-filled day on Wednesday deepened political tensions and fears two weeks before national midterm elections. None of the bombs detonated as law enforcement took them away for examination and disposal. The first crude bomb to be discovered had been delivered Monday to the suburban New York compound of George Soros, a liberal billionaire and major contributor to Democratic causes. The FBI said an additional package was intended for former Attorney General Eric Holder, but that one ended up at a Florida office of Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, whose return address was on it.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOSINEE, Wis. (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Wisconsin (all times local): 7:55 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's trying to be nice as he criticizes Sen. Tammy Baldwin at a Wisconsin rally following a series of attempted bombings on high-profile Democratic officials and CNN. Trump claimed Wednesday at a rally in Wisconsin that Baldwin is a "radical, far left opponent" who "who wants a socialist takeover of health care." Baldwin is being challenged by Republican Leah Vukmir. Trump says he's holding back his most fiery rhetoric because he's "trying to be nice." Trump opened the rally by calling for a new era of civility in politics following the attempted attacks on former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, CNN and others. And he said those in the political arena must "stop treating political opponents as being morally defective." Trump is in the state campaigning for Republicans, including Gov. Scott Walker.</description>
