      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever happens as President Donald Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to talk about Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, the risk of a devastating nuclear conflict appears higher now than at any time since the Cold War. And yet, pop culture has more or less stopped warning us of the dangers of atomic devastation - and that's too bad. We need fresh stories to help us understand the renewed and complex risks we face, and to nudge us out of our complacency. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set the infamous Doomsday Clock at two minutes to midnight in January 2018, making this our closest call since the 1950s.</description>

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/826210/republican-questioning-cohen-might-backfire-democrats-are-overreaching</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The early reviews are in and it's so far, not so good for the Republican line of questioning in Michael Cohen's testimony on Wednesday. It hasn't been much better for Democrats by most accounts, either. CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin did not mince words in his critique of the hearing, saying he was struck by "the breathtaking incompetence of the questioning" that did not lead to any valuable information from Cohen. "I am struck by the breathtaking incompetence of the questioning," @JeffreyToobin says about Michael Cohen's public testimony, adding that the line of questioning was "endless bloviating and not actually getting information out of the witness" https://t.co/ZTVEWm8W3p pic.twitter.com/DIba1VL22R â€” CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) February 27, 2019 A report from The Washington Post, meanwhile, asked whether Republicans' questioning could eventually backfire, as many of the attacks directed at Cohen are similar to criticisms leveled at Trump throughout his presidency â€” lying about the Trump Tower Moscow deal, hiring high-profile lawyers pro bono, and calling back witnesses who previously lied to Congress. In a running online commentary, reporters and editors from The New York Times noted that several of the Republicans' tactics have not panned out, including attempts to "show that Cohen is doing this for financial gain" (several questions revolved around whether the former lawyer is pursuing a book or movie deal). The Times' White House correspondent also noted some hypocrisy surrounding that topic, as Trump "often promotes such books when they flatter him." At the same time, Times reporter Nicholas Fandos asserted that the Republicans "actually have a clearer sense" of what they are hoping to achieve â€” "muddy the waters around Cohen" â€” than the Democrats, who "continue to overreach a bit" and "seem to be having a much harder time choosing which targets are worth their time." For example, editor Jonathan Weisman said that Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) â€” who asked Cohen if Trump arranged for "health care procedures" outside of the family â€” "seemed to have gone fishing and his hook came up the bait still on it."
