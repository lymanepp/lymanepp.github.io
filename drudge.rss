      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-allegations-leave-military-leaders-off-15544501.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Senior and former military leaders appeared to struggle Friday with how to respond to a report that President Donald Trump disparaged U.S. service members killed in combat as "losers," as the president attacked the allegations as "fake news."  The article elicited an array of reactions amid Trump's history with the military, which includes mocking Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for being captured in Vietnam, belittling the parents of an Army officer killed in Iraq, and dismissing brain injuries suffered by U.S. troops in an Iranian ballistic missile strike as "headaches."  The report in the Atlantic, published late Thursday, focused in part on a presidential visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day in 2017 and a canceled visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery outside Paris in 2018.  In the first example, according to the magazine, Trump allegedly said, "I don't get it. What was in it for them?" while standing with retired Marine Gen. John Kelly at the grave of Kelly's son, Robert, who was killed in Afghanistan. At the time, Kelly was homeland security secretary.  In the second, the Trump administration canceled the visit to the cemetery in France in bad weather when helicopter travel was questionable and Trump seemingly dismissed the World War I veterans who are buried there.  "Why should I go to that cemetery?" Trump said, according to the report. "It's filled with losers."  The president vehemently denied the report, attacking the Atlantic as a "third-rate magazine" and criticizing Kelly for not doing a good job as his former chief of staff.  "This man was totally exhausted. He wasn't even able to function in the last number of months," Trump said. He added that he did not know whether Kelly served as a source for the Atlantic's story, "but it...</description>

      <title>Portland on edge after suspect in weekend killing is fatally shot by police... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Suspect-in-Portland-slaying-is-killed-during-15542831.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. - Eyewitnesses and video footage gave police investigators murky accounts of the fatal shooting of a far-right activist here a week ago, according to newly unsealed court documents that shed new light on the politically charged incident but offer little in the way of definitive answers.  Investigators interviewed at least five people who saw some portion of the shooting of 39-year-old Aaron "Jay" Danielson and reviewed video footage, according to an arrest affidavit unsealed Friday, but their accounts stopped far short of providing a cohesive narrative.  Police said they ultimately came to believe Danielson was shot by a far-left activist, 48-year-old Michael Forest Reinoehl. But Reinoehl claimed publicly that he acted to defend himself and others, while a man who was with Danielson said his friend was targeted for a hat he wore bearing the insignia of the far-right Patriot Prayer group.  Reinoehl was shot and killed by law enforcement officers as they tried to arrest him Thursday.  The affidavit is likely to do little to cool the tension gripping Portland. Dueling demonstrators are expected in the region in the coming days, as a racial justice protest is set for Saturday and a pro-Trump event honoring Danielson is planned on Monday.  Oregon Democratic Gov. Kate Brown said at a press briefing Friday that she remained concerned about more violence and urged calm.  "There needs to be a community-wide effort to stop the violence," she said. "Because the violence must stop. Period."  Portland has seen more than three months of consecutive protests against police brutality, some of them descending into destruction and mayhem. But the tension intensified a week ago when a caravan of Trump supporters drove through the city in trucks, sparking skirmishes with those...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.cnn.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facing a persistent polling deficit and a struggling economy, President Donald Trump has cranked up pressure on administration health officials to expedite work both on a coronavirus vaccine and on treatments that might signal to voters there is an end in sight to the life-altering pandemic that has imperiled his reelection prospects.</description>

      <title>Russia working to undermine confidence, DHS warns...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Russia-is-working-to-undermine-confidence-in-15542913.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Russia is seeking "to undermine public trust in the electoral process" by spreading false claims that mail-in-ballots are riddled with fraud and susceptible to manipulation, according to a new intelligence bulletin by the Department of Homeland Security.  Many of the claims made by Russian sources are identical to repeated, unsupported public statements aired by President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr, who have said that mailed ballots aren't trustworthy while warning of the potential for rampant fraud in November's elections.  Homeland Security's intelligence office has assessed that Russian actors "are likely to promote allegations of corruption, system failure, and foreign malign interference to sow distrust in Democratic institutions and election outcomes," the bulletin states. Russia spreads these claims through a network of state-controlled media, proxy websites and social media trolls, it adds.  The document doesn't identify any of those media sources by name. But current and former officials who have seen it said the assessment is based in part on classified intelligence about the Russian government's efforts to interfere with the 2020 elections, in a repeat of its operations four years ago, which intelligence agencies have unanimously concluded were designed to help Trump win.  The intelligence on Russian efforts to undermine voting-by-mail has been assessed as credible and was deemed important enough to share in an unclassified form on Thursday with state and local officials so that they can take steps to protect elections from manipulation, the current and former officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information was not intended to be shared publicly.  The bulletin doesn't cite any particular statements by Trump, Barr or other U.S. officials, but it states that...</description>

      <title>Tiz the Law, born in New York and raised in Kentucky, carries dreams of two farms in Derby...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Tiz-the-Law-born-in-New-York-and-raised-in-15542861.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LOUISVILLE - Among the 14 states and two foreign countries that have bred foals who have become Kentucky Derby winners, Kentucky leads 111-6 over second-place Florida, 111-4 over third-place California and Virginia (unless one counts Secretariat more than once), and 111-1 over New York, leads that do seem insurmountable during our lifetimes. Yet if lopsided favorite Tiz the Law were to win the 146th Kentucky Derby on Saturday, New York would narrow its score to 111-2, and that would be something.  It's always something when somebody on hoofs who did not join the world in Kentucky joins the winner's circle at the Derby. It has happened only 34 times out of 145 since 1875, and only once in the last 15 runnings - in 2014, with the pixie-dust story arc of that Californian named California Chrome. So it just figures that even if Tiz the Law sustains his dominance of 2020, it would flatter New York . . . and Kentucky.  He was conceived in Kentucky, in Versailles.  His late mom traveled to New York, part of a general cooperation between two farms.  He joined all the earthly beings as a Bay horse with a big blaze on March 19, 2017, in New York.  He lived 90 days there per agreement, then returned to Kentucky to grow up, not to mention relish the equine pool at Twin Creeks Racing Stables in Versailles.  He returned to New York for sale as a yearling in August 2018.  That means two sets of farm people in two different states have watched him win the Belmont Stakes in June and the Travers in August with the mixtures of pride and wonder and happy disbelief. They know that for all the consuming toil they exert, having something like this happen in life borders on the farcical.  "A lot of times when it seems like nothing works in our business," said Becky Thomas, the owner of Sequel, the...</description>
