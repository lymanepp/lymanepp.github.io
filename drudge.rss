      <title>Story of abused dog that horrified nation  -- all a hoax!</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-story-of-an-abused-dog-horrified-people-14380897.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The images rippled across the country: a forlorn pup, her muzzle and throat all pink like she had broken out in a rash.  Her name was Dani, the sheriff in Butler County, Ohio, said last week. A concerned citizen had found her abandoned on the side of the road on Aug. 17, he said. Dani's muzzle was duct-taped shut and her throat slit open. The Good Samaritan rushed the dog to the veterinarian to save her, winning the hearts of animal lovers nationwide. The veterinarian discovered a chip on Dani saying she came from HART Rescue in Cincinnati - and soon inquiries were pouring into the sheriff's office about how to help the dog.  "How do I donate to the care and recovery of this poor sweet baby?" one person posted on Facebook.  "I would love to give this pup a loving home. Can I apply?" another asked.  Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones was touched, praising the community for coming together during the tragedy and directing donations to HART. But as Dani recovered, Jones asked for the public's help: He needed to find the person who did this.  "Words cannot describe the disgust I'm feeling right now," Jones wrote. "We will work diligently to find who did this and seek justice."  By Monday, the search was over.  Jones didn't have to look far to find Dani's owner: It was the same person who "found" her on the side of the road - and who made up the entire story just to get free vet care, Jones said Monday .  Jones said that detectives learned from the owner, who hasn't been named by police, that Dani had actually cut on her neck after running into a barbed-wire fence. Since the owner couldn't afford to take the dog to the vet, the person pretended to "find" the abused dog on the side of the road and make up a horrible story. The red marks around Dani's snout came not from duct...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;news.avclub.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At tonight’s MTV Video Music Awards, Missy Elliott was presented with the Video Vanguard award, signifying her many, many contributions to the music world and pop culture in general. Before that, though, she got a chance to show everyone why she deserved that award in the first place with a ridiculous, elaborate, and all-around awesome medley of her biggest hits—and biggest music videos. In her acceptance speech at the end, Missy Elliott made a point to highlight the work of dancers, saying they’re more than just background decoration, and her performance was pretty much entirely dedicated to proving that dancers are pretty damn cool. Oh sure, Missy Elliott was there, flying through the sky, dancing as a scarecrow, and pulling off seemingly effortless and instantaneous costume changes, but it was her team of dancers that stepped up and did cool shit while she made that stuff happen. In conclusion: Missy Elliott is cool and dancers are also cool. You can see the whole seven-minute performance below.</description>

      <title>Footage from camera outside Epstein's cell deemed unusable... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Footage-from-camera-outside-Epstein-s-cell-deemed-14380186.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least one camera in the hallway outside the cell where authorities say registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself earlier this month had footage that is unusable, although other, clearer footage was captured in the area, according to three people briefed on the evidence gathered earlier this month.  It was not immediately clear why some video footage outside Epstein's cell is too flawed for investigators to use or what is visible in the other, usable footage. The incident is being investigated by the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general's office, which are attempting to determine what happened and how to assess whether any policies were violated or crimes committed.  The footage is considered critical to those inquiries, and the revelation of an unusable recording is yet another of the apparent failures inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the short-staffed Bureau of Prisons facility in downtown Manhattan that held Epstein.  It's unclear whether the flaw in the taping affected a limited duration of the footage or whether it was a chronic problem in the beleaguered facility.  A Bureau of Prisons spokesman declined to comment, as did spokespeople for the FBI, the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.  The people who spoke about the footage requested anonymity, citing the ongoing probe.  Epstein, a well-connected financier, had been charged in early July with sexually abusing dozens of young girls in the early 2000s and ordered held without bond. The arrest brought a sense of long-awaited justice to those who said Epstein abused them and who had earlier been dismayed by a 2008 plea deal he received to resolve similar allegations that was widely criticized as too lenient.  That deal allowed Epstein to plead guilty...</description>
