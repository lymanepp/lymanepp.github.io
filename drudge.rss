      <title>IMF says economic collapse will be even worse than feared...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/IMF-says-global-economic-collapse-caused-by-15362593.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday painted a bleak portrait of the global economy, saying the coronavirus pandemic has caused more widespread damage than expected and will be followed by a sluggish recovery.  The global economy will shrink this year by 4.9%, worse than the 3% decline predicted in April, the IMF said.  No major economy is escaping the pandemic. The U.S. economy, the world's largest, is expected to shrink this year by 8%. Countries that use the single European currency are headed for a decline of more than 10% while Japanese output will fall by 5.8%, the IMF said.  The Chinese economy, suffering the twin ravages of the pandemic and the trade war with the U.S, is projected to eke out just a 1% gain -- its worst performance in several decades.  Current conditions are considerably more dire than the "unprecedented decline in global activity" that the fund projected two months ago. Since mid-April, economic data suggest "even deeper downturns than previously projected," the fund said.  Fund officials blamed the darker forecast on the effects of social distancing; scarring to global production capacity from the lockdown of activity; and the productivity cost of new safety and hygiene rules. Some economies also are still struggling to control the coronavirus, the fund added without naming specific governments.  The forecast assumes countries will not reimpose comprehensive lockdowns even if the pandemic flares up again.  Government crisis-fighting efforts -- including $11 trillion in spending and tax cuts -- have kept the economic collapse from worsening, the fund said.  The fund's forecast is more downbeat than some major investment firms. Goldman Sachs, for example, earlier this month raised its U.S. forecast to -4.2% from -5.2%.  The fund's forecast also...</description>

      <title>President drives immigration message amid pandemic and civil unrest... </title>
      <link>https://www.westport-news.com/news/article/Trump-visits-border-wall-to-drive-immigration-15361294.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.westport-news.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN LUIS, Ariz. - President Donald Trump toured a border fence along the U.S.-Mexico divide here Tuesday, seeking to tout what he views as a key reelection accomplishment in a critical state as his bid for a second term has been upended by a resurgent pandemic, an economic crisis and racial unrest.  Trump, who has increasingly focused on immigration amid the coronavirus crisis, said he was marking the 200th mile of border wall erected since his election and reviving one of the most contentious issues of a first term now defined by more pressing challenges.  "It's never mentioned anymore - the wall is never mentioned anymore," Trump said during a roundtable in Yuma, Ariz. "The reason it's not mentioned - it's not that we won the battle. It's that it's such a compelling thing to have done. Because you see the number, and where that wall is going, as you're seeing, it's like magic."  While visiting the border, Trump put his signature on a plaque attached to the barrier.  The trip - more than three hours on Air Force One to a state dealing with a record-high spike in coronavirus cases - was itself controversial because Trump and his aides continued to flout public health guidelines at the same time that top administration officials were testifying before Congress about the growing threat of the coronavirus, which causes the disease covid-19.  Neither Trump nor his aides wore masks during the visit to Arizona, which included the border wall tour and a speech to a crowded group of young supporters in Phoenix. Public health officials have argued against unnecessary travel and several testified Tuesday about the need to maintain social distancing and other preventive measures.  Calling the coronavirus pandemic the "greatest public health crisis" that the United States has faced in more than a century, Centers for Disease Control...</description>

      <title>Trump family seeks to block book by president's niece that calls him 'world's most dangerous man'... </title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Trump-family-seeks-to-block-book-by-president-s-15361378.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's brother on Tuesday petitioned a New York court to block the publication of a book by Mary Trump that describes her uncle President Donald Trump as the "world's most dangerous man."  Presales of the book, scheduled for publication on July 28, have soared to the top of best-seller lists on the basis of a description from publisher Simon &amp; Schuster that it will reveal decades of family secrets, including a "nightmare of traumas" that explain the psychology of the man who is now president.  President Trump told the Axios news service earlier this week that Mary Trump is "not allowed" to write the book because she signed a non-disclosure agreement in 2001 that settled her suit against Donald Trump and his siblings regarding her inheritance from her grandfather Fred Trump Sr., Donald Trump's father. President Trump said the agreement was a "very powerful one" that "covers everything."  In the petition to stop publication, President Trump's brother Robert Trump said Mary Trump had agreed as part of a settlement related to the inheritance fight that she "would not publish any account" of her relationship with Donald Trump or his siblings.  The terms of the agreement, which were disclosed as part of the petition to stop the book, required that Mary Trump not "directly or indirectly publish" any account of her relationship with the Trump family unless she had permission from Donald Trump and his siblings. The terms of that agreement had not previously been made public.  The petition was filed in Queens County Surrogate's Court in New York.  Mary Trump's lawyer Theodore Boutrous said in a statement that the family's effort to restrain publication should be tossed out.  "President Trump and his siblings seek to suppress a book that will discuss matters of...</description>
