      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;America's Great Observatories - the Hubble, Chandra, Compton and Spitzer space telescopes - have peered into the unknown and made breakthrough discoveries about newborn stars, dark matter and the age of the universe itself. But these telescopes, whose era began in 1990, are aging, if not already dead, and there is no budget or political will to replace them. This sobering reality was underscored this month when two were beset by technical problems, including the Hubble Space Telescope, that temporarily halted their science. Shrinking budgets and delayed projects means astronomers will lose some of their key eyes in the skies before NASA can launch new telescopes. It will make some research impossible.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) — In an otherwise innocuous part of Facebook's expansive Silicon Valley campus, a locked door bears a taped-on sign that reads "War Room." Behind the door lies a nerve center the social network has set up to combat fake accounts and bogus news stories ahead of upcoming elections. Inside the room are dozens of employees staring intently at their monitors while data streams across giant dashboards. On the walls are posters of the sort Facebook frequently uses to caution or exhort its employees. One reads, "Nothing at Facebook is somebody else's problem."</description>

"Thank you, thank you very much," Zuniga told her, accepting the gift with a broad grin. "I couldn't stand it anymore." Many of the more than 2,000 Hondurans in a migrant caravan trying to wend its way to the United States left spontaneously with little more than the clothes on their backs and what they could quickly throw into backpacks.</description>

(AP) — Their home full of soggy furniture and mosquitoes, Wilmer Capps was desperate to find shelter for his wife and their son Luke, born just three days after Hurricane Michael ravaged the Florida Panhandle. So Capps, wife Lorrainda Smith and little Luke settled in for the longest of nights in the best spot they could find: The parking lot of a Walmart store shut down by the storm. On a starry night, mother sat in the bed of the family's pickup truck; her child sat in a car seat beside her. Dad sat in the dark and pondered how it could be that his son's first night out of a hospital could be spent outside a big-box retailer because of a lack of help.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. - Interest in the midterm election is at a fever pitch in much of the country, with both Democrats and Republicans far more passionate than they've been in more than a decade. Could this be the year that Tennessee's Montgomery County shows up to vote? Located northwest of Nashville along the Kentucky border, this county often has one of the lowest voting rates in the state - in a state that often has one of the lowest rates in the country, and in a country that has one of the lowest rates in the world, trailing most developed nations.  During the divisive 2016 presidential election, Montgomery County registered its lowest turnout in the past six presidential elections.</description>
