      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CARACAS, Venezuela - It was Sheldon's 6th birthday, and Mary Cruz Lema realized she had to give him up. As Venezuela's economic crisis had deepened, she and her husband had been struggling to feed their beloved black and white schnauzer. Their collective salaries - hers as a schoolteacher and his as a nurse - equaled no more than $10 a month, barely enough to cover meals for themselves and their two children. The last time Sheldon had had a dog treat was in November. By January, their budget was so tight that Lema stopped buying pet shampoo and begin limiting his meals to one a day. By June, his only sustenance was a few leftover vegetables from the family table. Once playful, Sheldon became lethargic - sitting in a corner in distress.</description>
