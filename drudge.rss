      <title>INDEPENDENTS SHIFT LEFT</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-trails-Democratic-rivals-in-national-survey-14810165.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One year from the 2020 election, President Donald Trump trails some potential Democratic rivals in head-to-head matchups, with his national support level fixed at about 40 percent, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.  The new poll highlights the degree to which most of the country already has made a judgment about the president's performance and its voting preferences next year. Among the 39 percent of registered voters who approve of Trump's job performance, Trump is winning at least 95 percent support against each of five possible Democratic opponents. But among the 58 percent of voters who disapprove of Trump, he receives no more than 7 percent of support.  Former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., run strongest against the president nationally, with Biden leading by 17 points (56 percent to 39 percent), Warren by 15 points (55 percent to 40 percent) and Sanders by 14 points (55 percent to 41 percent).  South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., the other two Democrats tested against Trump, also lead the president among registered voters, with Buttigieg up by 52 percent to 41 percent, and Harris ahead by 51 percent to 42 percent.  The poll reflects national findings; other surveys in the states expected to play an outsize role in the 2020 contest have shown tighter races, particularly in parts of the Upper Midwest that Trump flipped from Democrats in 2016.  Nonetheless, the national results represent a shift away from Trump since the summer, when only Biden had a clear advantage over the incumbent. With Republicans and Democrats mostly locked into their voting intentions, the biggest difference between the results from July and those in the new poll is that independents have moved in the direction of the Democratic...</description>

      <title>WASH POST:  Pure, brazen contempt for Congress on full display...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/opinion/article/Trump-s-pure-brazen-contempt-for-Congress-is-on-14809452.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This editorial appears in The Washington Post.  - - -  "He must be brought forward to testify," President Donald Trump fumed on Twitter on Monday, regarding the whistleblower who revealed the president's corrupt attempts to extort political favors from Ukraine. "Written answers not acceptable!"  The president considered written answers more than adequate when special counsel Robert Mueller sought information from Trump during the Justice Department's Russia investigation. More to the point, if Trump were interested in fact-finding and truth-telling, rather than distracting from the substance of the charges against him, he would provide documents and encourage all relevant witnesses to testify. Instead, administration officials are refusing to testify before the House Intelligence Committee - officials who likely have firsthand knowledge crucial to the House's impeachment inquiry.  Robert Blair, an aide to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, was on the call during which Trump pressed Ukraine's president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden. John Eisenberg, a National Security Council lawyer, reportedly suggested limiting access to the transcript of that call and told others not to discuss it. Russell Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, might shed light on Trump's peremptory suspension of military aid to Ukraine, an act that appears to have been an element in the president's corrupt pressure campaign.  These no-shows are just the latest examples of the contemptuous war Trump and his allies have waged on Congress and its legitimate, constitutional oversight role, starting well before the impeachment inquiry. Even when Republicans controlled both chambers, former White House adviser Steve Bannon absurdly claimed executive privilege to refuse to answer congressional...</description>
