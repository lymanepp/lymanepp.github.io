      <description>&lt;b&gt;kdvr.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SILVERTON — Not only did Southwest Colorado experience healthy snowpack levels this season, but it also dealt with unprecedented avalanche activity. According to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, about 230 slides plummeted into the area since November 1, 2018. "Some things ran this year that hadn’t run in 50 years and some things didn’t run this year that normally run every year. So it’s crazy!” said Joe Jepsen, who lives just north of Silverton.</description>

      <title>WHO'S WINNING?</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-s-allies-insist-he-is-winning-in-feud-with-13896757.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - To many Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi scored a political victory over President Donald Trump this week, making him so incensed that he hurled insults at her and blew up negotiations on the one issue that held the promise of a rare bipartisan deal - infrastructure.  To the president's allies, a weakened Pelosi, D-Calif., needed to mollify her fractious Democratic caucus, with a growing number demanding that she launch an impeachment inquiry, a move that would give the president a fresh argument that he was a victim of overzealous Democrats incapable of legislating and only interested in investigations.  Taking stock of the feud, each side insisted they got the upper hand in a fight that shows no sign of waning 18 months before the 2020 elections, with implications for the economy as the budget and federal borrowing limit remain unresolved while the dispute over oversight between the White House and Congress rages.  Pelosi's allies said she showed up the president and reinforced an image of a chief executive behaving so badly and childishly that he is unfit for office - a clear message to voters next year. But to Trump's backers, the president succeeded in highlighting that an already unpopular politician is struggling not only with the far-left liberals in the Democratic ranks, but even some on her leadership team.  "She has very challenging dynamics in her conference, and she's trying to appease her conference," said Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence. "She has a very difficult job."  Some White House aides also said it was better for Trump to be fighting with Pelosi than former vice president Joe Biden or other 2020 candidates, as the president has done recently, elevating their status.  For Trump and Pelosi, the series of salvos...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/For-Pelosi-the-biggest-test-awaits-Impeach-or-13896496.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;House Democrats, under the leadership of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are slowly marching themselves toward the opening of an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. What seemed out of the question earlier in the year now seems, if not inevitable, increasingly difficult to resist.  Pelosi will not say anything like that at this point. She will continue to try to communicate to both sides of her divided party, nodding to hard-liners by suggesting that Trump's actions constitute potentially impeachable offenses while bowing to vulnerable members in swing districts by speaking cautiously about impeachment itself.  "We're not at that place," Pelosi said at a Thursday news conference, when the question of impeachment came up. That caution came after she noted that the investigations currently underway in the House could lead to "a place that is unavoidable in terms of impeachment." She also asserted that the White house "is just crying out" for impeachment, which she likely sees as a trap.  Trump has certainly put the Democrats in a difficult position. His past actions to disrupt and interfere with the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller are spelled out in detail in Mueller's report. Attorney General William Barr has said the evidence does not constitute obstruction of justice. Others strongly disagree, including many House Democrats who want to hear more about those episodes.  Beyond the contents of the Mueller report and what they say about the question of obstruction, the administration has further inflamed things by blocking virtually all requests from congressional committees for documents for investigations into various Trump-related matters. The president also ordered former White House counsel Donald McGahn not to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. When McGahn defied a subpoena...</description>
