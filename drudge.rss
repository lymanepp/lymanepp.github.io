      <title>Durant best in world? No longer in LeBron shadow...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Kevin-Durant-was-derided-for-taking-easy-path-13817756.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as a shy teenager, Kevin Durant expressed himself about one thing: his disdain for the nickname Durantula. He was a 19-year-old rookie phenom with the Seattle SuperSonics when people started to use the pun for fun, and he wasn't having it.  "Call me KD," he said then and still repeats now. "Just KD is fine."  Twelve years ago, Durant didn't seem to have many opinions. His life revolved around the gym and video games, and on most other matters, he went with the flow. But he was adamant about how you referred to him. He refused to let Durantula crawl into the NBA vernacular. He didn't want to let the obsession with his impossibly long arms and legs turn him into a thing. He wanted to be a person, an extraordinary one but still a person.  He lives by the introduction line on his Twitter handle, which he wrote 10 years ago: "IM ME, I DO ME, AND I CHILL."  Just KD is fine. Nothing else. So far in this postseason, Durant is playing some of the best basketball in his life, which is quite a statement considering his Hall of Fame resume: 10-time all-star, four-time scoring champion, two-time Finals MVP, one-time regular season MVP.  This is the platform Durant always wanted, even though he won't admit it. He's not in the shadow of LeBron James, who is home for the playoffs. More people love Steph Curry because he's a rather regular-sized dude and can make shots from the equator, but in these playoffs, Durant is the undisputed driving force on the Golden State Warriors. He's not riding their championship coattails, and in fact, that has always been true in his three seasons in the Bay Area. But during this run, he is carrying them more than usual, and finally you should be seeing him as a necessity and not the greatest luxury in NBA history. Unless you're some stubborn knucklehead clinging to outdated perceptions, Durant...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.hrw.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This report presents new evidence about the surveillance state in Xinjiang, where the government has subjected 13 million Turkic Muslims to heightened repression as part of its “Strike Hard Campaign against Violent Terrorism.” Between January 2018 and February 2019, Human Rights Watch was able to reverse engineer the mobile app that officials use to connect to the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), the Xinjiang policing program that aggregates data about people and flags those deemed potentially threatening. By examining the design of the app, which at the time was publicly available, Human Rights Watch found that Xinjiang authorities are collecting a wide array of information from ordinary people.</description>

      <title>Inside Bernie's Soviet 'honeymoon'...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Inside-Sanders-Soviet-honeymoon-13816193.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bernie Sanders was bare-chested, towel-draped, sitting at a table lined with vodka bottles, as he sang "This Land Is Your Land" to his hosts in the Soviet Union in the spring of 1988.  The just-married socialist mayor from Vermont was on what he called "a very strange honeymoon," an official 10-day visit to the communist country, and he was enthralled with the hospitality and the lessons that could be brought home.  "Let's take the strengths of both systems," he said upon completing the trip. "Let's learn from each other."  The Soviet sojourn has long been an extraordinary, if little understood, chapter in Sanders lore. He has for years used it to help explain his views about foreign policy, citing it as recently as last month.  The trip garnered brief mention in the 2016 presidential campaign, but earlier this year, a video from a Vermont community television station was posted online that showed a few minutes of Sanders' unlikely celebration with the Soviets. Right-leaning websites suggested Sanders was cozying up to communists, underscoring how the trip might be used against the senator if he becomes the Democratic nominee.  Until now, however, relatively few details about the trip have emerged, and most accounts have relied heavily on Sanders's recollection. An examination by The Washington Post of the trip - based on interviews with five people who accompanied Sanders, as well as audio and video of it - provides a fresh look at this formative time for Sanders, foreshadowing much of what animates his presidential bid.  As he campaigns for president a second time, Sanders, an Independent who is running in the Democratic primaries, takes credit for moving the party to the left, and he now finds himself competing with candidates who advocate for the kind of activist government positions Sanders touted during his Soviet...</description>

      <title>Trump faces string of setbacks in effort to juice economy...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Trump-faces-string-of-setbacks-in-efforts-to-13815162.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Mounting GOP opposition torpedoed conservative commentator Stephen Moore's candidacy as a Federal Reserve board governor Thursday, the latest in a string of setbacks that reveal hardening limitations on President Donald Trump's attempts to intervene in the economy.  Despite his efforts, Trump hasn't stopped the rise of gasoline prices and has demonstrated little influence over Senate Republicans and Fed officials when he has demanded that leaders heed his directives for managing the global economy.  Moore is a longtime Trump ally who served as an economic adviser to Trump during the 2016 campaign. Trump recently revealed that he wanted Moore to join the Fed's seven-member board of governors, believing the loyalist would move to halt interest rate increases to speed up growth.  But the selection drew bipartisan criticism because of Moore's past comments about women and controversial views he held on the economy, among other issues.  In recent days, Moore had attempted to distance himself from many of his past statements, and as recently as Thursday morning, he had insisted that he was not withdrawing from consideration.  A few hours later, Trump tweeted that Moore was withdrawing from consideration.  "Steve Moore, a great pro-growth economist and a truly fine person, has decided to withdraw from the Fed process. Steve won the battle of ideas," Trump wrote. ". . . I've asked Steve to work with me toward future economic growth in our Country."  Trump's effort to plant Moore on the Fed board was another in a string of attempts to use executive authority and the bully pulpit in ways that could goose the economy heading into the 2020 election.  In April, Trump loyalist Herman Cain announced that he was withdrawing from consideration for a spot on the Fed amid...</description>

      <title>UPDATE:  FACEBOOK bans 'dangerous' Farrakhan, INFOWARS...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Facebook-bans-far-right-leaders-including-13814271.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook said Thursday that it has permanently banned several far-right and anti-Semitic figures and organizations, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, Infowars host Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer, for being "dangerous," a sign that the social network is more aggressively enforcing its hate-speech policies at a moment when bigoted violence is on the rise around the world.  Facebook said it was going to remove the accounts, fan pages, and groups affiliated with these individuals on both Facebook and its sister site Instagram after it reevaluated the content that they had posted previously, or had examined their activities outside of Facebook, the company said. The removal also pertains to at least one of the organizations run by these people, Jones' Infowars.  "We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology. The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive, and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today," Facebook said in a statement.  The social network - which for years has resisted taking a more aggressive stance on extremism - is under massive pressure globally to curtail the ways in which its platform is used by hateful groups and individuals, most recently after massacres in Sri Lanka and New Zealand where the perpetrators used social media to spread their hateful messages.  "The timing is never an accident," said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, a liberal organization that has long advocated for more enforcement against white supremacy and is one of the groups Facebook briefed on the decision. "The reality is, people are getting killed. There are mass shootings and mass murders that are clearly being connected to ideas like white genocide, which are fueling...</description>
