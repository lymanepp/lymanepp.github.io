      <title>Influx of tech companies pushes Bay Area residents to breaking point...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/In-East-Palo-Alto-the-influx-of-tech-companies-13361661.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;EAST PALO ALTO, Calif. - This poor city is surrounded by the temples of the new American economy that has, in nearly every way imaginable, passed it by. Just outside the northern city limit, Facebook is expanding the blocks-long headquarters it built seven years ago. Google's offices sit just outside the southern edge, and just a few miles to the west, Stanford University stands as the rich proving ground of the economy's future. Amazon just moved in. Only a small fraction of jobs in those companies go to those who live in this city of 30,000 people, one of the region's few whose population is majority minority.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) — Waiting on the southern end of a bridge that leads to the United States, Humberto Alvarez Gonzalez warily follows the progress of the caravan winding through Mexico with the goal of reaching the border. Alvarez and about two dozen other people are waiting in Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas, because U.S. customs officers say there's no space to process them. They sleep on cots near the bridge and rely on donors who bring them food and clothing. Some have waited for two weeks.</description>

The divisions came during a tense day in which tempers flared and some migrants argued with caravan organizers and criticized Mexican officials. They were upset that Veracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes had reneged on an offer late Friday to provide buses on Saturday to leapfrog the migrants to Mexico City.</description>
