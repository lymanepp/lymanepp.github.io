      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ISLA, Mexico (AP) — A 4,000-strong caravan of Central American migrants traveling through Mexico split up into several groups with one spending the night in a town in the coastal state of Veracruz and other migrants continuing toward the country's capital. The divisions came during a tense day in which tempers flared and some migrants argued with caravan organizers and criticized Mexican officials. They were upset that Veracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes had reneged on an offer late Friday to provide buses on Saturday to leapfrog the migrants to Mexico City.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years of political volatility will culminate Tuesday when voters for the first time since the stunning 2016 election render a nationwide judgment on whether Trumpism is a historic anomaly or a reflection of modern-day America. As the midterms roared into their final weekend - with the biggest names in both parties exhorting their followers to vote - uncertainty enveloped the contest amid signs that tightening races appeared headed toward dramatic finishes. Just how many House seats Democrats might pick up - they need a net gain of 23 to win the majority - remained unclear.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXTON, Pennsylvania (AP) — For many voters in America's affluent suburbs, a flourishing economy is forcing a thorny dilemma for the midterm elections. Do they vote Democratic, in part to protest President Donald Trump for behavior some see as divisive and unpresidential? Or do they back Republicans in hopes that the economy will continue thriving under the majority party? A healthy economy has at least complicated their decision and blurred the outcome of the midterm elections . On Friday, the government reported that employers added a robust 250,000 jobs in October. And the unemployment rate stayed at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Democrats are delivering competing closing arguments during the final weekend before Tuesday's elections, but their messages are complicated by a deadly shooting in a politically pivotal state. Trump aimed to drum up voter turnout with events Saturday in Belgrade, Montana, and Pensacola, Florida, about 200 miles west of Florida's capital, Tallahassee, where two people were shot to death and five others wounded at a yoga studio on Friday night.</description>

      <link>https://apnews.com/6c4df5d8d6684e919b6431473684d895</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has been acting like a candidate on the ballot this week, staging daily double-header rallies and blasting out ads for Republicans up for election on Tuesday. Given the stakes for his presidency, he might as well be. A knot of investigations. Partisan gridlock. A warning shot for his re-election bid. Trump faces potentially debilitating fallout should Republicans lose control of one or both chambers in Congress, ending two years of GOP hegemony in Washington. A White House that has struggled to stay on course under favorable circumstances would be tested in dramatic ways. A president who often battles his own party, would face a far less forgiving opposition.</description>

President Donald Trump has another pair of rallies planned, in Montana and Florida, two states with marquee Senate races. In Florida, Trump is also trying to bolster the fortunes of Republican gubernatorial hopeful Ron DeSantis, a candidate he endorsed during the GOP primary, who has been lagging in polls behind Democrat Andrew Gillum. If elected, Gillum would be the state's first black governor.</description>
