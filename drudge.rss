      <title>Nearly all major moves by Trump admin have been via executive orders...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Trump-s-legally-dubious-executive-actions-are-15470685.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEDMINSTER, N.J. - Already largely absent from intense negotiations for a coronavirus stimulus package, President Donald Trump fully distanced himself from the thorny legislative process by leaving Washington on Thursday for a weekend at his private golf resort in New Jersey.  After talks on Capitol Hill collapsed, Trump assembled some of his dues-paying club members to watch him complete the final step of what has become a familiar routine in his turbulent presidency: signing a legally dubious executive order after failing to reach a deal with Congress.  The president who pitched himself to voters as the consummate negotiator and ultimate dealmaker has repeatedly found his strategies flummoxed by the complexities and pressures of Washington lawmaking. In response, he has frequently relied on showmanship and pageantry to try to turn negotiating failures into victories.  "We're going to be signing some bills in a little while that are going to be very important, and will take care of, pretty much, this entire situation," Trump said Saturday from his club's grand ballroom, surrounded by presidential seals, American flags and news cameras.  He was greeted with raucous applause by dozens of supporters as he posed for pictures in a simulation of a White House signing ceremony after major legislation is passed.  But the four documents the president signed Saturday were neither "bills" nor "acts" despite his comments referring to them as such, and their effectiveness and legality are already being called into question by Democrats and some Republicans in the Congress he is attempting to bypass.  Trump said the executive actions he signed would provide economic relief to millions of Americans by deferring payroll taxes and provide temporary unemployment benefits by repurposing unspent dollars. But whether that relief will ever...</description>

      <title>School year like no other launches with chaos coast to coast... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/School-year-like-no-other-launches-with-chaos-15470902.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - It's going to be screen time all the time for kindergartners and graduate students alike. Teachers are threatening strikes. And students are already coming home infected with the coronavirus, which has upended American education.  The 2020-21 school year has dawned, and it's more chaotic than any before it.  Plans are changing so fast that students and parents can hardly keep up. Districts that spent all summer planning hybrid systems, in which children would be in school part of the week, ditched them as coronavirus cases surged. Universities changed their teaching models, their start dates and their rules for housing, all with scant notice.  And many districts and colleges have yet to make final decisions, even now, with the fall term already underway in some of the country.  "Plans are changing right up till the moment that schools open," said Michael Casserly, executive director of Great City Schools, a lobbying group for large districts.  Chicago Public Schools announced last week that, after planning a hybrid system, its classes would begin the year online. Districts across the country have pushed back their opening dates. Last week, the first week of school in Georgia's Cherokee County School District, administrators sent 14 letters to parents, each disclosing new cases of the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease covid-19. They included 13 students ranging from first to 12th grades, and a few teachers. More than 300 students who had been in contact with them were directed to quarantine for 14 days.  "Our parents wanted a choice for their children, and we delivered - it is not perfect, and we all know that, but perfection is not possible in a pandemic," Superintendent Brian Hightower said Friday in a message to the community.  Another Georgia high school, in Paulding County, drew national...</description>

      <title>President vows permanent cut to payroll tax...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Democrats-assail-Trump-actions-on-payroll-tax-and-15470397.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's new executive actions to disburse coronavirus relief without Congress sparked confusion and frustration Sunday among businesses, Democrats and state officials, some of whom lamented the moves would not deliver the necessary relief to cash-strapped Americans.  Trump's directives were aimed at offering new unemployment benefits, protecting renters from eviction and postponing the payment of a federal tax. But an array of economists and lawmakers depicted these policies as incomplete, unworkable or legally questionable - raising the prospect that the president's attempt to boost the economy may have a muted impact.  One of the orders allows employees making less than $104,000 to delay until January payment of a payroll tax that funds Social Security and Medicare. Trump added that he would try to change federal rules next year to make the deferred payments into a permanent tax cut - but only if he is reelected.  The tax typically is taken out of paychecks by employers. And businesses, payment processors and economists signaled Sunday, in the absence of a guarantee, that the payroll taxes actually will be absolved, businesses would be unlikely to alter worker paychecks.  "It's a little bit of a leap of faith on an employer's part," said Pete Isberg, the vice president of government affairs for ADP, which processes payments for 40 million workers and 800,000 businesses.  Isberg said it may take months for some businesses to implement a system that can defer payroll taxes for a few months, delaying any potential boost to the economy. "It's not clear employers broadly will adopt this," he added. "It's not clear employees will want to take it even if they qualify."  Unable to swing a deal with Democrats, Trump resorted to executive actions as concerns in Washington intensified about the...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - As the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows is responsible for coordinating the vast executive branch, including its coronavirus response. But in closed-door meetings, he has revealed his skepticism of the two physicians guiding the anti-pandemic effort, Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci, routinely questioning their expertise, according to senior administration officials and other people briefed on the internal discussions.

He has regularly raised with Fauci and others a range of issues on which he thinks Fauci has been wrong, and he personally monitors the infectious-disease expert's media appearances. When he catches Fauci sounding out of sync with Trump, the chief of staff admonishes the doctor to "stay on message," officials said - and he has impressed upon Fauci, Birx and other public health professionals that they should not opine on restrictions or make policy in the media.  In an interview Saturday, Meadows said he has been appropriately skeptical of information presented to him but disputed that he is anti-science.  "My comments to all of our doctors is that they need to stick with the science, comment on the science and do not become media commentators and opine on what may or may not happen," he said. "I've been consistent from...</description>
