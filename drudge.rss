      <title>Radio station disputes host's story of firing...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/A-radio-host-who-has-been-critical-of-Trump-says-14842799.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A conservative radio station in Colorado is disputing claims by one of its hosts that the station fired him mid-show last weekend just as he was airing disapproval of President Donald Trump. As host Craig Silverman and executives with the Denver-based 710 KNUS shared their views of events, the incident underscored the growing isolation of conservatives whose viewpoints reflect anything but unwavering support of Trump.  Silverman was not fired but was taken off air because of his decision to move forward with appearing on a competing station over management's objections, Salem Media Group General Manager and VP Brian Taylor said late Sunday - a statement Silverman said he interprets as KNUS backtracking to avoid violating a contract that requires 30 days' notice before termination.  "We have never told Mr. Silverman the position to take on Trump and impeachment," Taylor said in an email to The Washington Post. "Our hosts have the freedom to express their opinions on current events based on their own personal conviction. That goes for all of our hosts, including Mr. Silverman. Any suggestion to the contrary is simply untrue."  Despite Taylor's clarification, Silverman said Monday that his future with KNUS remains unclear.  "I'm not sure what I'll do. I'm still processing," Silverman told The Post. He said a key factor in his decision over whether to return to KNUS is if the station restores his show's archives to its site, including the Nov. 16 show in question. After Saturday's show, the station pulled the page for "The Craig Silverman Show," along with its podcast archive, from its website.  "Why not post the podcasts?" Silverman said. "[Listeners] would hear exactly what I was talking about when they cut the mic - I was talking about the connection between Roy Cohn, and...</description>

      <title>Health under scrutiny again...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Trump-s-health-under-scrutiny-again-after-14844719.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's impromptu weekend visit to a doctor remained shrouded in secrecy Monday, as he stayed away from the public eye and the White House dodged questions about his health.  Trump, 73, made an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda on Saturday, later saying on Twitter that he had begun "phase one" of his annual physical exam and that the results had been "very good."  It is unusual for a president to do a physical exam in multiple stages months apart, and the circumstances surrounding Trump's visit renewed questions about the status of his health and the White House's handling of his medical information, according to several experts.  The White House would not say Monday if Trump planned to release records from his visit or describe which tests he took.  In a statement on Saturday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump had undergone a "quick exam and labs" and that he "remains healthy and energetic without complaints." Grisham also said Trump had taken advantage of a "free weekend" in Washington to "begin portions of his routine annual physical exam."  The White House did not respond to requests for more information Monday.  Two people who interacted with Trump late last week said he seemed to be hoarse and have signs of a cold, but nothing serious seemed amiss.  Trump's voice was occasionally subdued and raspy during a news conference Wednesday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But Trump, 73, also spoke for more than an hour Thursday at a political rally, the latest in a string of campaign events that the White House has pointed to as signs of his energy and vigor.  On Monday, he remained out of public view, holding his meetings behind closed doors. He met with Federal Reserve...</description>

      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/IRS-whistleblower-case-advances-as-Senate-staff-14843718.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Two Senators are probing a whistleblower's allegations that at least one political appointee at the Treasury Department may have tried to interfere with the audit of President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, a sign that lawmakers are moving to investigate the complaint lodged by a senior staffer at the Internal Revenue Service.  Staff for Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate finance committee, met with the IRS whistleblower earlier this month, those people said. Follow-up interviews are being scheduled to further explore the whistleblower's allegations.  It could not be learned to what extent the senators view the whistleblower as a credible source. Trump administration officials have previously downplayed the complaint's significance and suggested it is politically motivated.  The whistleblower, a career IRS official, initially filed a complaint in July, reporting that he was told at least one Treasury political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president's or vice president's tax returns. In recent weeks, the whistleblower filed additional documentation related to the original complaint, which was given to congressional officials in July, the two people said. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the complaint, which pertains to a confidential IRS audit that cannot be disclosed under federal law.  The contents of the additional information provided by the whistleblower were not known.  The IRS whistleblower complaint was first disclosed in an August court filing by Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. It raises the prospect that Trump administration officials at...</description>

      <title>Out of jail and facing uncertain future, Brazil's Lula trying to stage improbable comeback...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Out-of-jail-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-14843261.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RECIFE, Brazil - The spectacle known as Lula is on the move. Thousands of people in red are massing in the streets. There are demands to remember the poor. And Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the leftist former president of Brazil, is overlooking the throngs, booming into a microphone.  Fresh out of prison, Lula, as he is widely known, is a gifted orator who for decades has been one of Latin America's most influential figures. After serving 580 days for corruption and money laundering, he was released this month on grounds that he had been denied due process.  For now, he is free to give speeches like one at this seaside city on Sunday - or at least until he exhausts all of his appeals.  The uncertainty of his legal situation underscores his political limitations and the obstacles that lie before him in his apparent quest to reassert himself as Brazil's dominant political leader.  He is out of prison, but he is not innocent. He is back in public, but is making appearances only where he is assured to receive a warm welcome. He has spent much of his adult life either running for or being president, but is now barred from doing so because of his criminal record. Even some on the left aren't rejoicing at his return. "Snake charmer," one prominent center-left politician here called him last week.  It is clear that Lula - who has been tweeting, giving speeches and holding rallies since the moment of his release - wants Brazil back. But is the feeling mutual? Or has Lula, who left office with an 80 percent approval rating, become too polarizing, too associated with scandal and corruption, to ever again command widespread support?  In recent polls, 58 percent of Brazilians said they had a negative impression of him while 34 percent had a positive one. By that measure, he is less popular than Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a...</description>
