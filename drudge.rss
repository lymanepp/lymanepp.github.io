      <title>Security upped in DC...</title>
      <link>https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Security-upped-in-D-C-region-after-threats-by-14957314.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.seattlepi.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Authorities across the Washington, District of Columbia, region are boosting security at military bases, Arlington Cemetery and at sites along the National Mall following threats by Iran to retaliate against the United States for the killing of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani.  In some cases, entry gates at military facilities have been closed, and officials are carrying out more thorough identity checks. A spokesman for the U.S. Park Police said the agency's uniformed officers will have a more visible presence because of the tensions with Iran.  "There's no specific threats," said Sgt. Eduardo Delgado, spokesman for the U.S. Park Police. "It's just an abundance of precaution."  But the rollout of the enhanced security has not been smooth in every case, leaving some people facing a chaotic return to work at the beginning of the new year. The Navy command that runs Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, modified some of its new precautions and issued a lighthearted mea culpa on its Facebook page Monday evening after the security changescaused monstrous traffic in the area that morning.  "Today's traffic was awful. It was horrible," the post read. "It looked at normal D.C. Monday traffic and said, 'Hey, watch this!' "  Nevertheless, officials wrote that the enhanced security was necessary to keep people safe.  Last week, President Donald Trump ordered the drone strike that killed Soleimani, Iran's most important military commander. Iran's leaders quickly promised to take revenge. And an Iranian official said Tuesday that the country was considering 13 scenarios for retaliation and had American bases in the Middle East under surveillance.  Over the weekend, the Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin warning that Iran and its...</description>

      <title>FACEBOOK to ban deepfakes, but new policy may not cover controversial Pelosi video...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Facebook-to-ban-deepfakes-sources-say-but-new-14954730.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook plans to issue new rules as soon as Tuesday that would ban users from posting computer-generated, highly manipulated videos, known as deepfakes, seeking to stop the spread of a novel form of misinformation months before the 2020 presidential election.  But the policy - described by three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet-unannounced rules - does not ban all doctored videos. It appears, for example, that Facebook's new guidelines would not have prohibited a deceptively edited clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that went viral on the social network last year.  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday. The change in policy comes as a company executive prepares to testify at a congressional hearing later this week on "manipulation and deception in the digital age."  Going forward, Facebook intends to ban videos that are "edited or synthesized" by technologies such as artificial intelligence in a way that average users would not easily spot, the people said, including attempts to make the subject of a video say words that they never did.  Facebook, however, will not ban videos manipulated for the point of parody or satire. And it signaled that other lesser forms of manipulation would not be outlawed, either, though they could be fact-checked and limited in their spread on the social networking site, the people said.  The policy does not appear to cover the infamously altered "drunk" video of Pelosi that was viewed millions of times on Facebook last year. Though her speech was slowed and distorted in the video to make her sound inebriated, the effect was accomplished with relatively simple video-editing software. To contrast with more sophisticated computer-generated "deepfakes," disinformation researchers have referred to these...</description>
