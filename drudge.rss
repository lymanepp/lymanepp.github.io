      <title>Macron addresses France; Too late?</title>
      <link>https://www.apnews.com/e3788b2dc7b14229be0eaadc7cc8b450</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron is preparing to speak to the nation Monday at last, after increasingly violent and radicalized protests against his leadership and a long silence that aggravated the anger. Many protesters only want one thing: for him to declare "I quit." That's an unlikely prospect. Instead Macron is expected to announce a series of measures to reduce taxes and boost purchasing power for the masses who feel his presidency has favored the rich. He's being forced to act after four weeks of "yellow vest" protests that started in struggling provinces and spread to rioting in the capital that has scared tourists and foreign investors and shaken France to the core.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not just getting moving that is important for better health. Health experts say people should have a muscle-strengthening component to their exercise, too. Yet 58 percent of American adults don't do any muscle-strengthening exercise, according to research. Among the activities that qualify are lifting weights and exercising with elastic bands, both of which create resistance that you must work against, as well as push-ups, situps, climbing stairs, cycling, hiking up hills. Still, the researchers - who analyzed data on nearly 400,000 people ages 18 to 80, representing all U.S.</description>

So is this the end of the decade-long bull market? Or is it the sort of normal, healthy pullback that often follows lengthy gains?</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.cnn.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carl Bernstein has described the Nixon years as a "criminal presidency." So Brian Stelter asks him if the same term applies to President Trump. "I don't think we know completely yet," Bernstein says. But "I think it's very obvious that there has been a criminal conspiracy led by the president of the United States to obstruct justice. It's hard to see otherwise in the filings that have been made public thus far."</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Executives at more than a dozen generic-drug companies had a form of shorthand to describe how they conducted business, insider lingo worked out over steak dinners, cocktail receptions and rounds of golf. The "sandbox," according to investigators, was the market for generic prescription drugs, where everyone was expected to play nice. "Fair share" described dividing up the sales pie to ensure that each company reaped continued profits. "Trashing the market" was used when a competitor ignored these unwritten rules and sold drugs for less than agreed-upon prices. The terminology reflected more than just the clubbiness of a powerful industry, according to authorities and several lawsuits.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's top pick to replace chief of staff John Kelly, Nick Ayers, is no longer expected to fill the role. Ayers, who is chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, was seen as the favorite for the job when Trump announced Saturday that Kelly would leave around year's end. But a White House official said Sunday that Trump and Ayers could not reach agreement on Ayers' length of service and that he would instead assist the president from outside the administration.</description>
