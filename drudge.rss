      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALEXANDRIA, Va. - No one mentioned Donald Trump. Robert Mueller, either. The word "Russia" was not uttered. On the first day of the first trial to result from the special counsel's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, President Trump did not tweet about any "rigged witch hunt." He said nothing about "13 Angry Democrats," his biting shorthand for the prosecutors who are examining any potential ties between his campaign and Russian operatives.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SACRAMENTO — California’s firefighters are stretched as thin as they have ever been, state officials said Tuesday, with no indication that the wave of fires scorching the Golden State will ease in the coming months. It used to be that the fire season picked up at the end of August and ran through October. That changed with the state’s five-year drought, and this year’s outbreak in July has officials worried about firefighter fatigue. It was an unprecedented month for fires, both in the number of acres burned and the cost of fielding crews to douse the flames. The state spent $125 million in July fighting wildfires.</description>

The vivacious cleric reportedly had spent time with famous Americans such as Bing Crosby and the Hearst family. He was a prolific fundraiser for big-name Catholic groups from right to left, and valued for his connection to Pope John Paul II, who dispatched McCarrick to hot spots worldwide as his diplomat. President George W. Bush, also new in town that January, marked his first private dinner in Washington by going to the home of the new archbishop.</description>
