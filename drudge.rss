      <title>Space Force logo 'suspiciously' similar to STAR TREK...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/891643/trump-debuts-official-space-force-logo--literally-ripoff-star-trek</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently President Trump thought we hadn't had enough Star Trek spinoffs for one year. After literal years of anticipation, President Trump debuted a logo for the 'Space Force' he's been touting his entire presidency. It's none of the adorable logos he asked Trump email subscribers to vote on about a year and a half ago, but instead a near-exact replica of the Starfleet Command logo from Star Trek. After consultation with our Great Military Leaders, designers, and others, I am pleased to present the new logo for the United States Space Force, the Sixth Branch of our Magnificent Military! pic.twitter.com/TC8pT4yHFT â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 24, 2020 The similarities were immediately apparent ... pic.twitter.com/tOQWhLxrUy â€” Steve Kovach (@stevekovach) January 24, 2020 ... and George Takei quickly verified we weren't just seeing things.

      <title>New Hero of the Left: Judge Napolitano...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Democrats-have-a-new-impeachment-hero-Fox-News-15001227.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the Senate reconvened Thursday for President Donald Trump's historic impeachment trial, a name began trending on Twitter among those pushing for the president's removal from office: Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano.  Better known as Judge Napolitano or Judge Nap, the conservative commentator was once a Trump supporter and purveyor of conspiracy theories. But recently, Napolitano has shifted his stance on the president, voicing criticisms of Trump that are often at odds with the views of his fellow Fox News personalities.  Napolitano's deviation from Fox News's normally pro-Trump opinion programming continued this week when the former New Jersey Superior Court judge published an opinion piece pushing back against the president's repeated claims that the impeachment proceeding is a "hoax."  Napolitano described the proceedings as "deadly serious business based on well-established constitutional norms." He also made a case for why he believes there is "ample and uncontradicted" evidence for the Senate to vote to remove the president, writing that there are "valid, lawful, constitutional arguments for Trump's impeachment that he ought to take seriously."  The op-ed appeared to have been first published Wednesday by the Washington Examiner, a conservative news outlet, before it showed up on Fox News's site early Thursday.  "What is required for removal of the president?" Napolitano wrote. "A demonstration of presidential commission of high crimes and misdemeanors, of which in Trump's case the evidence is ample and uncontradicted."  This is not the first time that Napolitano has pushed for Trump's impeachment in recent months, nor is his stance all that surprising, given that he has been described as a "staunch libertarian" who "places principles over partisanship, and who is outspoken and critical without...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIJING - A young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1,500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway.  Reports of eight new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies.  Adding to the stress, Friday marked the official start of the Spring Festival, when China celebrates the arrival of the new lunar year. Authorities around the country, including in the capital, Beijing, have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that accompany the holiday to avoid having large public gatherings where the airborne virus could spread.  "The public should not gather during the Spring Festival and try stay at home as much as possible to protect themselves," Gao Fu, a member of the expert group of the National Health and Health Commission and director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday.  He encouraged everyone to wear masks, and photos from train stations and airports across the country showed people with their mouths and noses covered.  The Beijing Capital International Airport was unusually empty on Friday, with almost all passengers wearing masks. The Beijing city government and Shanghai local authorities have also urged residents returning to areas affected by the virus, or who have been in contact with suspected cases, to stay at home or in a centralized quarantine area for 14 days to contain the spread.  The state broadcaster, CCTV, led its midday news program with a...</description>
