      <title>Tests Barr with more tweets...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-fires-off-more-tweets-about-Justice-15067614.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump continued to test his relationship with Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday by amplifying conservative allies demanding he "clean house" at the Justice Department and target those involved in the Russia investigation that once threatened his presidency.  The grievances shared by Trump in a flurry of morning tweets included claims of a "seditious conspiracy" against him, and attacks on a "criminal gang" at the FBI and Justice Department.  A day after it was revealed that Barr told people close to Trump he had considered quitting, the president and his attorney general seemed to reach a detente of sorts. Officials inside the Justice Department said they were watching the situation closely, mindful that a new string of tweets or comments could quickly upend the situation, but there were no indications that Barr would leave imminently. The attorney general did not mention the controversy when he spoke during an event at FBI headquarters Wednesday.  The fragile equilibrium may be tested again Thursday, when Trump's longtime friend Roger Stone is scheduled to be sentenced for lying to Congress and obstruction. Trump's tweets about Stone last week prompted Barr to speak out publicly, saying the president's declarations "make it impossible for me to do my job."  If Trump continues to tweet, and Barr continues to stay in his job, "I think he is in danger of getting into 'Boy Who Cried Wolf' territory," said Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman in the Obama administration. "He's already said the president's commenting made his job impossible, and the president kept commenting, and then he apparently told people that he was considering resigning if the president didn't stop. So if the president doesn't stop now and he doesn't quit, he looks feckless and insincere."  In the...</description>
