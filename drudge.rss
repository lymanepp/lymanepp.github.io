      <title>Trump has installed 187 judges to federal bench...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-is-remaking-the-federal-judiciary-14924789.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - After three years in office, President Donald Trump has remade the federal judiciary, ensuring a conservative tilt for decades and cementing his legacy no matter the outcome of November's election.  Trump nominees make up 1 in 4 U.S. circuit court judges. Two of his picks sit on the Supreme Court. And this past week, as the House voted to impeach the president, the Republican-led Senate confirmed another 13 district court judges.  In total, Trump has installed 187 judges to the federal bench.  Trump's mark on the judiciary is already having far-reaching effects on legislation and liberal priorities. Just last week, the 5th Circuit struck down a core provision of the Affordable Care Act. One of the two appellate judges who ruled against the landmark law was a Trump appointee.  The Supreme Court - where two of the nine justices are conservatives selected by Trump - could eventually hear that case.  The 13 circuit courts are the second most powerful in the nation, serving as a last stop for appeals on lower court rulings, unless the case is taken up by the Supreme Court. So far, Trump has appointed 50 judges to circuit court benches. Comparatively, by this point in President Barack Obama's first term, he had confirmed 25. At the end of his eight years, he had appointed 55 circuit judges.  Trump's appointments have flipped three circuit courts to majority GOP-appointed judges, including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York. The president has also selected younger conservatives for these lifetime appointments, ensuring his impact is felt for many years.  The executor of this aggressive push is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is almost singularly focused on reshaping the federal judiciary, twice ramming through Senate rule...</description>

      <title>'CHRISTIANITY TODAY' EDITOR IN CHIEF RETIRING...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/opinion/article/Christianity-Today-s-op-ed-isn-t-attacking-Trump-14924288.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Galli is retiring in January from his position as editor in chief of Christianity Today, a publication founded by the late evangelist Billy Graham. On Thursday, he decided to go out with a bang by expressing an unpopular sentiment among much of the religious right in an op-ed titled "Trump Should Be Removed from Office," which took off on social media, briefly caused the magazine's website to crash and drew this lamentably predictable response from the president:  "A far left magazine, or very 'progressive,' as some would call it, which has been doing poorly and hasn't been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years, Christianity Today, knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would rather have a Radical Left nonbeliever, who wants to take your religion &amp; your guns, than Donald Trump as your President," Trump said in a series of tweets. "No President has done more for the Evangelical community, and it's not even close."  Trump's defenders are sure to chalk this up as just one more example that shows he is a "counterpuncher," someone who always "hits back" when attacked. But the op-ed isn't an attack - Galli concedes that the debate over impeaching and removing Trump is rife with partisanship, and he grants that reasonable minds can differ about whether impeachment or an election should decide Trump's political fate. Rather, he is defending Christianity after years of its adherents' moral compromises in the realm of politics.  He is clear that he will not immediately change minds and might lose readers: a December NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll found that 80% of white evangelical Christians oppose the Senate removing Trump from office, compared to 49% of the public overall. But on Friday, Galli explained his real mission: "As a Christian," he told CNN's John Berman,...</description>
