      <description>&lt;b&gt;freebeacon.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frank James, the man arrested for Tuesday's New York City subway shooting, is a black nationalist and outspoken racist who railed against whites, Jews, and Hispanics. A careful reader of the New York Times could be forgiven for overlooking that. In a nearly-2,000 word article on the attack, James's race is not mentioned. The same is true for the coverage offered up by ABC News and Reuters; the Washington Post only mentioned James's race in relation to his condemnation of training programs for "low-income Black youths."</description>
