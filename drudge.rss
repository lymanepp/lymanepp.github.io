      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Amid-adversity-and-missteps-Joe-Biden-s-14906746.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For most of the year, former vice president Joe Biden has often been described in negative terms. It has been said he is not as sharp as he should be or once was; that he is well liked but can't excite the base of the new Democratic Party; that his agenda is little more than "return to normalcy" and that his fundraising problems belie bigger weaknesses.  All of that is well and good, but he nears the end of 2019 also as a candidate who has absorbed more criticism than just about everyone else in the Democratic field combined, and he has survived the attacks reasonably well. He remains atop the national polls, his support among African Americans has proved durable through the year, and while his numbers have slipped in Iowa and New Hampshire, he is nonetheless in the battle in those two early-voting states.  The story of Biden for most of the year has been written as a glass-half-empty narrative. What about the opposite way of viewing where he stands? I recently asked a Democrat who has been involved in several presidential races this question: What if Biden were to win the Iowa caucuses? His answer: "He could run the table."  This Democrat was not predicting it; nor was he ruling it out. But if Iowa falls into Biden's column, it would instantly change the way everyone looks at the 2020 field and the potential outcomes.  This has happened before. In December 2003, then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., the perceived early front-runner, was in all kinds of trouble. He was running behind in Iowa and New Hampshire and was down in the polls nationally. His campaign had been through a staff shake-up that left supporters lacking in confidence. He seemed to be floundering.  Even some of Kerry's closest advisers were saying privately, just weeks before Iowa, that Howard Dean was the likeliest person to win that state and to become the...</description>
