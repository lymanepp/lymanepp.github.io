      <title>Falwell invites students back to Liberty campus; He's 'protecting' them...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/904376/jerry-falwell-jr-inviting-some-students-back-liberty-university-amid-pandemic-argues-hes-protecting</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. is no stranger to controversy. So it's not a total surprise that he's bucking the trend set by most other universities and inviting students back to campus amid the coronavirus pandemic. Falwell told The Richmond Times-Dispatch that somewhere between several hundred and 5,000 students â€” a small percentage of the university's total enrollment â€” will live in dorms, where they will continue their online classes. Professors are expected to report to campus despite the remote coursework. 'I think we have a responsibility to our students â€” who paid to be here, who want to be here, who love it here â€” to give them the ability to be with their friends, to continue their studies, enjoy the room and board they've already paid for and to not interrupt their college life,' Falwell said. Falwell also said he believes the decision is 'protecting' the students, most of whom do not fall into any at-risk categories, whether that be age or underlying conditions, and if any students do fall ill with COVID-19, the school has identified a nearby hotel to house them while they recover. But at least one faculty member, Marybeth Davis Baggett, has pushed back against the decision. Baggett called the decision a 'recipe for disaster,' pointing out that the campus population comes into regular contact with residents of Lynchburg, Virginia.

      <title>One continent remains untouched by the coronavirus: Antarctica...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/One-continent-remains-untouched-by-the-15152948.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One continent has not yet confirmed a case of the novel coronavirus. It's a place of barren ice, where the all-consuming cold and darkness of winter is fast approaching.  Over the past few months, some 4,000 people from around the world have watched from Antarctica as the coronavirus pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China, swept around the globe, reaching all but its southernmost reaches.  "You'd better stay there, you're safer there," Alberto Della Rovere, leader of the 35th Italian expedition to Antarctica, said his colleagues at home told him via WhatsApp.  For now, they appear to be right. Even in normal times, only a limited number of people are allowed in and out of Antarctica, with medical workers screening for signs of influenza and other illnesses before arrival.  "Right now, this, Antarctica, is the safest place in the world," Della Rovere said. "There are no outside contacts and we're far away from any settlement."  On social media, residents of various Antarctic stations have acknowledged their strange status. "I think it is safe to say that McMurdo Station, Antarctica, had the largest St. Patrick's Party in the world in 2020," wrote one person stationed there.  A U.S. contractor at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station posted a photograph of boxes and boxes of toilet paper. "Don't worry about us," he wrote.  People stationed in Antarctica might be unlikely to catch the virus, but they would be at great risk if they did. While most bases would be able to handle a single case of a serious respiratory infection, they would struggle to contain one that spreads as rapidly as the coronavirus. And there's no way to guarantee that it won't eventually spread to ends of the Earth.  "No continent is immune, including Antarctica," said Jeff Ayton, chief medical officer at the...</description>
