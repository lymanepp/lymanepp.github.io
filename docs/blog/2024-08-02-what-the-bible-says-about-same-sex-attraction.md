## What the Bible Says About Same-Sex Attraction

The topic of same-sex attraction has garnered significant attention in recent years, both within and outside Christian circles. To understand the biblical perspective on this issue, it is crucial to approach the Scriptures with clarity and context. This blog post aims to provide a thorough examination of what the Bible says about same-sex attraction, focusing on key passages and their interpretations.

The biblical view holds that same-sex attraction is contrary to God's design for human sexuality, as outlined in Scripture. Romans 1:26-27 describes same-sex desires and relations as "dishonorable passions" and "contrary to nature," indicating that they deviate from the natural order established by God. The Bible emphasizes that such desires do not align with the intended order for human relationships.

To ensure a clear and consistent understanding of the concepts discussed, it is essential to define key terms used in this discussion:

- **Same-sex attraction**: Refers to the temptation to engage in same-sex behaviors. In the biblical context, attraction itself is not considered sinful but represents a challenge to align one's actions with God's commands. James 1:14 says, "but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed."

- **Same-sex desires**: Describes when a person not only experiences same-sex attraction but also consents to, entertains, or nurtures thoughts and feelings related to it. James 1:15 says, "then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin".

- **Same-sex relations**: Refers to romantic or sexual interactions between individuals of the same sex.

The account of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19:1-29 is one of the earliest references to same-sex attraction in the Bible. In this passage, two angels visit Sodom, and the men of the city surround Lot's house, demanding to have sexual relations with the visitors. Lot's refusal and the subsequent destruction of the city are often cited in discussions on same-sex attraction. While this passage depicts intended same-sex relations as part of Sodom's wickedness, it is important to note that the sin of Sodom was multifaceted, including arrogance, lack of hospitality, and social injustice (Ezekiel 16:49-50). However, the specific act of intended same-sex relations is highlighted as a grievous sin.

In Leviticus, direct prohibitions against same-sex relations are found:

- **Leviticus 18:22**: "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination."
- **Leviticus 20:13**: "If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them."

These verses are part of the Holiness Code, which outlines various laws meant to distinguish the Israelites from surrounding nations. The term "abomination" (Hebrew: *to'evá*) indicates that this behavior is seen as morally detestable in God's eyes.

In the New Testament, Paul addresses same-sex attraction and behavior in several passages that highlight its inconsistency with God's design for human sexuality. In Romans 1:26-27, Paul discusses the moral decay of humanity, stating: "For this reason, God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error." Paul describes such behavior as "contrary to nature" and "shameless," indicating that it deviates from God's intended order for human sexuality.

Similarly, in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Paul lists behaviors incompatible with inheriting the kingdom of God: "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God." The phrase "men who practice homosexuality" is translated from two Greek words: *malakoi* and *arsenokoitai*. While there is debate about the precise meanings, these terms are generally understood to refer to different aspects of same-sex relations.

In 1 Timothy 1:9-10, Paul also lists same-sex relations among other behaviors that are contrary to sound doctrine: "those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine." This grouping underscores the incompatibility of same-sex relations with Christian teaching.

To fully understand these passages, it is crucial to consider the broader biblical context. The Bible consistently presents sexual relations as intended to be within the bounds of marriage between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:4-6). Acting on same-sex attraction is viewed as a deviation from this design.

The Bible’s teachings on same-sex attraction must also be understood within the context of its overall message of sin, redemption, and sanctification. All humans are considered sinful (Romans 3:23), and the gospel offers forgiveness and transformation through Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 6:11). The biblical stance on same-sex attraction is clear: it is seen as a result of the fallen human condition and contrary to God's design.

Sanctification, the process by which believers are made holy and conformed to the image of Christ, is central to this discussion. As Christians grow in their faith, they are called to align their lives more closely with God’s will, which includes rejecting sinful desires and behaviors. This transformative journey involves continuous repentance, renewal, and living out God's commands (Romans 6:11; Ephesians 4:22-24). 

Thus, while the Bible's teachings on same-sex attraction are clear, it also emphasizes the transformative power of sanctification. Believers are invited to seek personal holiness and growth through the Holy Spirit, striving to overcome sinful temptations and live according to God's design. In this process, Christians are called to respond to all sin with both truth and grace, upholding biblical teachings while extending love and compassion to individuals. This recognizes that everyone is in need of God's grace and the sanctifying work of Christ.

In a world where views on sexuality are rapidly changing, Christians are called to stand firm in biblical truth while embodying Christ's love. The Bible's message is not just about condemning sin but about offering redemption and new life to all who turn to God in repentance and faith.

In conclusion, the Bible clearly presents acting on same-sex attraction as contrary to God's design and will. However, it also calls believers to engage with others with love and compassion, reflecting the heart of the gospel.
