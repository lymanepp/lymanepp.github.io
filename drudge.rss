      <title>Detention cells so overcrowded US using aircraft to move migrants...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Border-detention-cells-in-Texas-are-so-13837856.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overcrowding at Border Patrol stations in South Texas has become so acute in recent days that U.S. authorities have taken the rare step of using aircraft to relocate migrants to other areas of the border simply to begin processing them, according to three Homeland Security officials.  The first flight left McAllen, Texas, on Friday, transferring detainees to Border Patrol facilities in Del Rio, Texas. There are daily flights scheduled for the next several days, with two planned for Tuesday, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the operations.  The flights are conducted by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, but the detainees remain in the custody of Border Patrol, officials said. Though ICE routinely uses aircraft to move detainees among its detention facilities, it is very unusual for Border Patrol to fly recent arrivals from one part of the border to another to perform routine booking procedures.  Homeland Security officials requested the aircraft because Border Patrol urgently needs to move single adults out of the lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. The agency is scrambling to make room for the large volume of families and children who have come across the border in dramatically higher numbers in the past several days, officials said.  One official said the U.S. government has resorted to using aircraft because all available buses were already in use and authorities needed every available transportation option.  "This is the worst I have ever seen it, by far," said one veteran Border Patrol agent in South Texas who was not authorized to speak to reporters.  The number of people taken into custody along the Mexico border has exceeded 5,500 each day for several days in a row, and Border Patrol currently has more than 17,500 people in holding cells and tent sites set up in...</description>

      <title>Failure to reach trade agreement raises risk of permanent tariffs...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/President-Trump-s-tariffs-once-described-as-13837022.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The failure of the United States and China to reach agreement Friday on a comprehensive trade deal raises the risk that President Donald Trump's favorite negotiating tool - high tariffs on imported goods - may be hardening into a permanent feature of the U.S. economy.  Two days of talks ended Friday with no sign of the agreement that both governments once had predicted would be achieved by this point. After parting company with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pronounced the latest discussions "constructive" but declined to elaborate.  Less than 12 hours earlier, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods had increased to 25% from 10%, in a sign of the president's waning patience with the negotiations.  Trump, who has started the process of imposing tariffs on all remaining U.S. imports of Chinese goods, also issued a flurry of tweets embracing tariffs as his preferred economic policy and hinting that the China levies might linger.  "The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversations . . . into the future will continue. In the meantime, the United States has imposed Tariffs on China, which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations!" the president tweeted.  Trump's enthusiasm for tariffs has been no secret since his calls during his presidential campaign for a 45% tariff on everything Americans buy from China. But his focus on tariffs is a striking departure from the policies pursued by his Democratic and Republican predecessors - especially if he proceeds with his threat to apply tariffs to all $540 billion of annual U.S. purchases from China.  "Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind," he said in an earlier tweet, adding that raising...</description>

      <title>RECORDS SMASHED: WETTEST YEAR IN HISTORY OF USA...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Genuinely-scary-Torrential-rain-in-Houston-13834973.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clusters of violent and slow-moving thunderstorms converged on the Houston area Thursday night, unleashing torrential rain and enormous hail. The deluge wrought havoc on the city, spurring floods reminiscent of Hurricane Harvey in some areas.  And the heavy rain threat is not over.  Houston is under a flash flood watch through Saturday night given the potential for at least one to three additional inches of rain on top of the two to five inches which fell Thursday night and two to three inches Tuesday.  "Soils remain saturated from recent rainfall and many bayous, creeks and rivers remain high so any additional rainfall should run off quickly and cause flooding," the National Weather Service office serving Houston wrote.  Houston is in a slight risk zone for excessive rainfall both Friday and Saturday.  Additional rainfall is not predicted to be as intense as Thursday night's deluge, but the Weather Service urged residents to "stay put" if extreme rainfall returns: "Do not attempt to travel," it warned. "Underpasses and low-water crossings will be life-threatening. If caught in a sinking vehicle, get OUT. Bayous will likely exceed banks and structure flooding could be possible."  By all accounts, Thursday night's storms in Houston, which have left the region susceptible to more flooding, were wild. "This is probably the most hellacious rain I've ever heard in my life," tweeted Matt Lanza, meteorologist for the Houston weather website SpaceCityWeather.com.  The storms left "at least three bayous flowing over the top of their banks, nearly 90,000 residents without power and dozens reportedly trapped for a time in floodwater on Interstate 10," The Washington Post's Timothy Bella reported.  As much as five inches of rain reportedly fell in one hour in east Houston's Greens...</description>

      <title>UBER BUST: 'One of most disappointing IPOs ever'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/840751/uber-having-most-disappointing-ipos-ever</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uber is not having the uberprofitable day it was hoping for. The ride-hailing company set its IPO at $45 per share on Thursday night, but ended up selling at $42 as soon as the market opened on Friday morning. Shares soon fell even lower to $41.06, nearly recovered to their original asking price by mid-day, and dropped once again to point Uber toward one of the worst first-day IPO performances of the decade. Forecasts originally predicted Uber would price itself at $46-$48 per share, though its eventual decision of $45 per share with an $81 billion IPO was still massive. Still, the company never actually saw that set price materialize, and only peaked at $44.74 around 1 p.m. Uber's immediate 6 percent fall after the floor opened makes it one of just 60 companies who've seen a debut day loss of 5 percent or more in the past 10 years, Bloomberg notes. And there's a strong chance it could become the eighth of those companies to actually end up in the red for its first day. Uber has barely gone a day without some kind of public scandal or outcry in the past two years, and this past week was no exception. Drivers for Uber and rival companies went on strike by turning off their apps on Wednesday to protest low wages and a lack of worker benefits. Uber later said it reached settlements with many of the 60,000 drivers who've protested, adding that those settlements would cost upwards of $170 million. The strike was planned to coincide with Uber's first day on the market, though it's unclear if the uproar had anything to do with Uber's dismal performance. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
