      <title>USA to cut troops on Mexico border...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/bdcaae2eaf5f4d2b9cb8a5d8464be3c5</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî U.S. officials say the number of active-duty troops on the border with Mexico will drop from 5,600 to about 4,000, and their deployment will be extended through the end of January. Officials say the Department of Homeland Security submitted a formal request for the additional military support Friday. It hasn't been approved by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. But military officials have been working with DHS for weeks to help craft a request that would be accepted by the Pentagon. President Donald Trump deployed the troops to the border in response to a caravan of migrants walking to the U.S. from Central America. Critics have called the deployment a political stunt before the midterm elections.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.houstonchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In two major developments this week, President Donald Trump has been labeled in the parlance of criminal investigations as a major subject of interest, complete with an opaque legal code name: "Individual 1." New evidence from two separate fronts of special counsel Robert Mueller III's investigation casts fresh doubts on Trump's version of key events involving Russia, signaling potential political and legal peril for the president. Investigators have now publicly cast Trump as a central figure of their probe into whether Trump's campaign conspired with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With architecture dating back to the Middle Ages, Prague is a city whose modern identity is still defined by its many layers of ancient history, much of which remains gloriously intact. And yet, it is here - among a city of Baroque palaces, ornate, Renaissance-era chapels and cobblestone streets - that one of the first flashes of the future has suddenly, randomly emerged. It has been dubbed "Cyberdog." Though the name conjures images of an Eastern European Internet Cafe frequented by backpackers, it actually belongs to a newly opened wine bar. Unlike other wine bars in the Czech capital, however, this one has a new twist: It is staffed by a robotic bartender who serves drinks ordered via a smartphone app, according to Reuters.</description>
