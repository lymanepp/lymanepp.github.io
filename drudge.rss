      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-US-put-nuclear-waste-under-a-dome-on-a-13858749.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 6:45 a.m. on March 1, 1954, the blue sky stretching over the south Pacific Ocean was split open by an enormous red flash.  Within seconds, a mushroom cloud towered 4 1/2 miles high over Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The explosion, the U.S. government's first weaponized hydrogen bomb, was 1,000 times more powerful than the "Little Boy" atomic bomb blast that flattened Hiroshima - and a complete miscalculation.  Scientists had underestimated the size of what became known as the "Castle Bravo" test, resulting in an explosion that was two-and-a-half times larger than expected. Radioactive ash dropped more than 7,000 square miles from the bomb site, caking the nearby inhabited islands.  "Within hours, the atoll was covered with a fine, white, powder-like substance," the Marshall Islands health minister would later testify, according to the Atomic Heritage Foundation. "No one knew it was radioactive fallout. The children played in the 'snow.' They ate it."  The 1954 explosion was part of a series of nuclear tests conducted as the American military lurched into the nuclear age. From 1946 to 1958, 67 U.S. nuclear tests pulverized the tranquil reefs and islands of South Pacific. International pressure finally halted the bombing, but the damage was done - and continues to this day.  That was the message reiterated by U.N. Secretary General António Guterres on a recent tour of the South Pacific to discuss climate change. In Fiji on Thursday, he told the crowd about "a kind of coffin" built by the U.S. in the Marshall Islands to house the deadly radioactive debris from 1980s. The structure, however, was never meant to last. Today, due to disrepair and rising sea tides, it is dangerously vulnerable. A strong storm could breach the dome, releasing the deadly legacy of America's nuclear might.  "I've just been with the...</description>
