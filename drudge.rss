      <title>U.S.-China trade war faces another superpower: AMAZON...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LORTON, Va. - Maxsa Innovations, a small business selling electronic gadgets on the outskirts of Washington, was already reeling from the U.S.-China trade war when it realized it had a third superpower to manage: Amazon.  Maxsa, which manufactures many of its products in China, had to start paying 25 percent more to import some goods after the United States introduced tariffs on Chinese-made products last summer. Faced with higher costs, Maxsa says it managed to persuade several small U.S. retailers to pay roughly 20 percent more for the company's wares.  But its biggest customer, Amazon, drove a much harder bargain.  Amazon, which buys products from Maxsa and then sells them to consumers, initially rejected Maxsa's attempt to charge more for a laser-guided parking aid called Park Right, forcing Maxsa to cut off sales to the online retailer. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)  "Please do what you can to help get this through," Maxsa founder Skip West pleaded in a January email to Amazon, part of an exchange reviewed by The Washington Post. "I felt horrible turning down $18,000 in orders this week."  As President Donald Trump ramps up his trade war with China, other consumer-product companies report similar struggles getting big retailers to budge.  With the internet driving ruthless price competition among Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot and others, large retailers are loath to pay more or to raise their own prices. That leaves importers of Chinese goods caught between the trade war and Americans' quest for the best possible deal.  "Retailers are all about everyday low prices. They want to protect consumers, but they also want to protect their sales," said Jason Trice, president of Jasco Products, a lighting and electronics seller in...</description>

      <title>THE FLYNN TAPES...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Judge-orders-public-release-of-what-Michael-Flynn-13852480.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A federal judge on Thursday ordered that prosecutors make public a transcript of a phone call that former national security adviser Michael Flynn tried hard to hide with a lie: his conversation with a Russian ambassador in late 2016.  U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington ordered the government also to provide a public transcript of a November 2017 voice mail involving Flynn. In that sensitive call, President Donald Trump's attorney left a message for Flynn's attorney reminding him of the president's fondness for Flynn at a time when Flynn was considering cooperating with federal investigators.  The transcripts, which the judge ordered be posted on a court website by May 31, would reveal conversations at the center of two major avenues of special counsel Robert Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. So far they have only been disclosed to the public in fragments in court filings and the Mueller report.  Sullivan also ordered that still-redacted portions of the Mueller report that relate to Flynn be given to the court and made public.  Sullivan's orders came very shortly after government prosecutors agreed to release some sealed records in Flynn's case. The release was in response to a motion filed with the court earlier this year by The Washington Post, which argued that the public deserved to know more about Flynn's role in key events and cooperation with investigators.  Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to one felony count of making a false statement to FBI investigators about his contact with the ambassador and awaits sentencing.  The purpose of the phone calls, and the motives of the callers, have been hotly debated.  In the December 2016 call, Flynn urged that the Kremlin not get too riled up about U.S....</description>

      <title>Israel brushes off Eurovision boycott calls with big assist from Madonna...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/At-Eurovision-pop-and-politics-collide-13852933.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TEL AVIV - Eurovision is Europe's longest-running and best-loved music contest, drawing few big names but plenty of flamboyance and the cheesiest of pop songs. But with the competition taking place in Israel this week, the usually festive atmosphere is tinged with politics.  Amid calls for a boycott from pro-Palestinian activists, Israel and its supporters are determined to showcase the country in a positive light, even bringing on board the Queen of Pop to draw in Americans.  Madonna arrived in Israel on Tuesday and is scheduled to perform at the contest's grand finale on Saturday night. The bombastic live show, including supermodel Bar Refaelias as one of the announcers, is expected to attract an international television audience of about 200 million viewers.  Madonna made clear she would not bend to political pressure from any side. In a statement to Reuters, she said, "I'll never stop playing music to suit someone's political agenda nor will I stop speaking out against violations of human rights wherever in the world they may be."  The idea to include Madonna came from Sylvan Adams, an Israeli Canadian businessman who calls himself an "ambassador at large for Israel." He is paying the veteran star $1 million to appear, saying she would give both Eurovision and Israel more visibility, "as well as adding glitz, glamour, sizzle and sparkle."  "To host the biggest song competition in the world is a wonderful opportunity. These types of opportunities don't come along for Israel too often," he said.  Israel won the right to host the competition after Israeli singer Netta captured the public vote in the contest last year with the song "Toy," a high-energy reference to the #MeToo movement, replete with chicken sounds.  When Netta's victory was announced last year,...</description>

      <title>Doctors go undercover to fight historically deadly Ebola outbreak...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Doctors-go-undercover-to-fight-Ebola-in-violent-13852225.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DAKAR, Senegal - Some doctors fighting the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history are afraid to wear scrubs.  They mask their identities to avoid harassment and violence in Congo, where the epidemic is spreading at the fastest rate since it started in August - and where rampant misinformation fuels a distrust of outsiders in medical garb. The World Health Organization has logged 119 attacks this year against health workers. Eighty-five have been wounded or killed.  Fear is changing tactics among aid staffers, who set out to convince communities that Ebola is real and they were there to help end it. Now some downplay their mission in public, swapping white coats for street clothes and attention-grabbing SUVs for motorbikes that blend into traffic.  "Our staff has to lie about being doctors in order to treat people," said Tariq Riebel, emergency response director in Congo for the International Rescue Committee (IRC), a global aid group.  And the violence hampers the response effort in a more direct way: Ebola infections tend to spike after attacks, experts say, because emergency responders are forced to take cover and halt the distribution of immunity-boosting vaccinations.  The death toll in the central African country reached 1,136 this week, government officials said. The infection count, meanwhile, has climbed to 1,632 - with 88 more suspected, Congo's Ministry of Health said. Concerns are growing that the crisis in Congo's North Kivu province could become as lethal as West Africa's battle against the hemorrhagic fever from 2013 to 2016, which killed 11,310 people across three countries.  "The tragedy is that we have the technical means to stop Ebola, but until all parties halt attacks on the response, it will be very difficult to end this outbreak," WHO Director...</description>

      <title>House Dems fall in line with Pelosi's no-impeachment strategy... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/House-Dems-fall-in-line-with-Pelosi-s-13849065.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump, who is refusing to cooperate with more than 20 congressional investigations, instructed current and former aides Wednesday to ignore a House committee's request for documents in the latest act of defiance that has prompted Democrats to declare the nation is facing a constitutional crisis.  But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told Democrats in a closed-door caucus meeting Wednesday morning to stick to their policy agenda ahead of the 2020 election rather than initiate impeachment proceedings. And not a single lawmaker challenged her.  The events underscored that Pelosi has managed to hold the line on her no-impeachment stance despite Trump's ongoing resistance and relentless liberal pressure for Democrats to try to oust the Republican president. Most notably, she has quelled an internal clamor and kept even the most vocal impeachment proponents and eager investigators in check along with committee leaders as Democrats increasingly look to the courts to settle the fight between Congress and the chief executive.  In the nearly hourlong, closed-door session heavily focused on health care, Pelosi was the only one to bring up impeachment, acknowledging that some Democrats are complaining.  "Why aren't we impeaching the president?" she said, parroting their words. "Why aren't we impeaching him? They get a little down," she said of frustrated members of her party.  "The point is that we need to show (voters) that we are doing all of these other things that they care about so much," Pelosi said. Not a single lawmaker in the room protested.  In the latest example of the president's resistance, the White House told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., that it was refusing a broad demand for records and testimony sent to...</description>
