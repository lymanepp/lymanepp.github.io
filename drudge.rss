      <title>Ontario premier's apologizes after retracting restrictions...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TORONTO (AP) — Ontario Premier Doug Ford apologized Thursday for a failed attempt to ban playgrounds and allow police to stop and question people who were not in their homes — measures that created a backlash from police forces, health officials and the public. The leader of Canada’s most populous province, in his first public appearance since announcing the restrictions, said his government had moved too fast with the measures. "They left a lot of people angry and upset. I know we got it wrong. I know we made a mistake and for that I’m sorry and sincerely apologize,” said Ford, who appeared to choke back tears at one point.</description>

      <title>Protesters descend on Manchin's houseboat...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/978885/joe-manchin-lives-boat-washington--protesters-are-reportedly-headed-there</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Protesters evidently want all hands on deck in the push to make Washington, D.C. a state, and they're now headed to Sen. Joe Manchin's (D-W.Va.) nautical home. Advocates for D.C. statehood are planning a protest on Thursday, Politico reported, and they'll be gathering at Manchin's house ... boat. 'Yes,' Politico writes for those unfamiliar, '[Manchin] lives on a boat docked in the harbor when he's in Washington.' Indeed, the boat, Almost Heaven, is 'anchored 8 miles south of the Capitol,' a Time story described in 2014, going on to note that Manchin 'routinely invites senators from both parties out for evening cruises.' 'I wasn't crazy on buying any real estate in Washington, not at all,' Manchin told Time. The Washingtonian may have summed it up by writing, 'Manchin lives on a boat because he doesn't like living here.' In fact, this ended up sparking a Republican attack ad against Manchin in 2018, which slammed him for his '$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht.' That's an assertion PolitiFact gave a 'half-true' rating, writing that the boat's '40-foot length would generally qualify it as a yacht, but since Manchin lives there when he is in town, it could be just as easily described as a houseboat' — though he apparently purchased it for $220,000.  Either way, it seems Manchin is one lawmaker who at any given moment — including, perhaps, as protesters gather — is always ready to sail away into the sunset.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will open a global climate summit with a pledge to cut at least in half the climate-wrecking coal and petroleum fumes that the U.S. pumps out, a commitment he hopes will spur China and other big polluters to speed up efforts of their own. Biden is offering Americans and the world a vision of a prosperous, clean-energy United States where factories churn out cutting-edge batteries for export, line workers re-lay an efficient national electrical grid and crews cap abandoned oil and gas rigs and coal mines. His commitment to cut U.S. fossil fuel emissions up to 52% by 2030 — similar to pledges from allies — will come at the launch Thursday of an all-virtual climate summit for 40 world leaders, marking a return by the U.S. to global climate efforts after four years of withdrawal under President Donald Trump.</description>

      <title>EU MOVES TO REGULATE AI</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LONDON (AP) — Risky uses of artificial intelligence that threaten people’s safety or rights such as live facial scanning should be banned or tightly controlled, European Union officials said Wednesday as they outlined an ambitious package of proposed regulations to rein in the rapidly expanding technology. The draft regulations from the EU's executive commission include rules for applications deemed high risk such as AI systems to filter out school, job or loan applicants. They would also ban artificial intelligence outright in a few cases considered too risky, such as government “social scoring” systems that judge people based on their behavior. The proposals are the 27-nation bloc’s latest move to maintain its role as the world’s standard-bearer for technology regulation, as it tries to keep up with the world's two big tech superpowers, the U.S. and China. EU officials say they are taking a four-level “risk-based approach” that seeks to balance important rights such as privacy against the need to encourage innovation.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOSCOW (AP) — Police arrested nearly 1,500 people Wednesday during a day of demonstrations throughout Russia calling for freedom for imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose health reportedly is in severe decline after three weeks of hunger striking, according to a group that monitors political detentions. The largest of the protests took place in Moscow, where thousands marched through the center city. Some of the people arrested were seized before the protests even began, including to top Navalny associates in Moscow. Navalny’s team called for the unsanctioned demonstrations after weekend reports that his health is deteriorating and his life was in danger.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MISSION, Kan. (AP) — About three-quarters of Kansas counties have turned down new shipments of the coronavirus vaccine at least once over the past month and several for four straight weeks, state date shows. “It is kind of stalling. Some people just don’t want it," said Stacey Hileman, a nurse with the health department in rural northwest Kansas' Decatur County, where only about 29% of the county's 2,900 residents have received at least one vaccine dose. Her county is among six that have rejected allocations for all four weeks. Thirty-three other counties paused shipments from the state for one week, 26 for two weeks and 16 for three weeks. Only 24 counties, mostly the larger ones such as Shawnee, Johnson and Sedgwick, haven't turned down any shipments.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RENO, Nev. (AP) — Burning Man organizers have said that they are considering requiring attendees to prove they have been vaccinated for COVID-19 if the organizers move forward with plans to hold this year’s counter-culture festival in the Nevada desert. The organizers backed off an earlier statement indicating that they had already decided to make the shots mandatory. They say they won’t decide for sure until the end of the month whether the event that was canceled last year because of the pandemic will take place this summer. Burning Man CEO Marian Goodell said in a video message posted on the group’s web site on April 8 that “vaccines will be required to come to Burning Man.” She erroneously said at that time that the state of Nevada requires that people have proof of vaccination at large gatherings.</description>
