      <title>Could America re-start draft?</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Could-the-strike-on-an-Iranian-general-trigger-a-14950144.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the hours since the Trump administration announced that the high-ranking Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani had been killed in a U.S. airstrike, Americans wondered: Does this mean war?  And for young people, there was a follow-up: Would I have to go?  The impact of President Donald Trump's decision to order a strike against Soleimani has yet to be seen, it has turned up the heat on America's already tense relationship with Iran, a country the president has portrayed as one of America's most dangerous adversaries. Google searches for terms such as "conscription", "Selective Service" and "Iran" spiked, according to Trends data, as youthful social media users on platforms like TikTok and Instagram dealt with this collective political anxiety the best way they knew how: by spinning out endless memes about getting drafted in a hypothetical, but seemingly imminent, World War III.  On Friday, the website for the Selective Service, a federal agency tasked with maintaining a database of adult men who could be called upon should a crisis require a draft, experienced technical difficulties as people flooded the site.  The draft was suspended in 1973 because of intense public and political opposition to the Vietnam War, and Congress and the president would have to pass legislation to bring it back, should an emergency call for it. But America still keeps a database of all young men who could be called upon should the draft ever return.  Every year, millions of young, adult men are required by law to register with the Selective Service, "a relatively low-cost insurance policy for our nation," as the agency puts it.  If you're a male residing in the United States between ages 18 and 25, you are required by law to register for the Selective Service. The mandate applies whether you're a U.S. citizen, immigrant, or undocumented...</description>

      <title>SURPRISES? UPSETS?</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/887461/joker-winning-best-picture-4-more-upsets-that-could-happen-2020-golden-globes</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could another evening of stunners be ahead at the 2020 Golden Globes? The yearly show honoring the best of television and film is notorious for its shock picks, which are made by the fewer than 100 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. This year, wins by movies from legendary filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino seem likely, but the Globes is anything but predictable. With that in mind, let's take a look at a few upsets that could be in the cards this Sunday. 1. Ramy Youssef for best actor in a comedy series - Pundits are generally predicting a Bill Hader, Ben Platt, or Paul Rudd win, but Vanity Fair thinks Ramy Youssef could surprise, noting the HFPA 'loves a chance to recognize fresh talent.' 2. The Morning Show for best drama series - A Succession win appears most likely, but might Apple TV+'s The Morning Show steal the Roy family's thunder? The Wrap suggests so, pointing out that the HFPA also loves tipping its hat to freshman series and 'their members are said to adore' this one. 3. Antonio Banderas for best actor in a drama film - This category is thought to be a race between Adam Driver and Joaquin Phoenix â€” but Vanity Fair suggests Antonio Banderas could be a dark horse contender. 4. Ana de Armas for best actress in a comedy or musical film - Awkwafina is the frontrunner, but the HFPA gave Knives Out more love than expected with three nominations, and Gold Derby writes prognosticators 'might be underestimating' star Ana de Armas. 5. Joker for best drama film - After last year's Bohemian Rhapsody, pundits are bracing for another jaw-dropper in this category, in which The Irishman seems like something of a lock. Could Joker's Todd Phillips earning a surprise Best Director nomination indicate the HFPA is more enthusiastic about his film than many realize? The New York Times' Kyle Buchanan believes this could be the 'shock of the night.' Brendan Morrow</description>

      <title>Trump thought war with Iran could help Obama reelection. What about his own?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Trump-thought-war-with-Iran-could-help-reelect-14949215.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The president who once mused about a president attacking Iran to win reelection has now inched closer to war with Iran - in his own reelection year.  But if President Donald Trump truly thinks a new war in the Middle East might help him win, he might want to think again.  Ever since the controversial decision to kill a high-ranking Iranian military official in Baghdad on Thursday, Trump's critics have pointed anxiously to his past commentary on the politics of war with Iran. Trump repeatedly in 2011 and 2012 predicted Barack Obama would attack Iran because it was the only way he would be reelected. Trump was doubly wrong: The attack never came, and Obama won comfortably anyway.  But as he confronts his own difficult reelection math and a standoff with Iran, it's worth considering whether Trump might be making a similar calculation for himself - however cynical that thought might be.  What we can say at this point: There's little reason to believe it would help.  Pollsters and political analysts often talk about a "rally around the flag" effect that comes when the United States is attacked or launches new military campaigns. And there is something to that. But it's often quite short-lived, and there's little evidence it has actually helped any recent president win reelection.  The most recent example would be the Iraq War, which George W. Bush launched in March 2003. According to Gallup data, his approval rating increased from 58 percent just before the invasion to 71 percent immediately afterward. But it was back to 58 percent just four months later, and despite the capture of Saddam Hussein in late 2003, on the eve of the 2004 election it stood at 48 percent.  Approval of the war was middling by then, with exit polls showing 51 percent approved of the decision to go to...</description>

      <title>Venezuela opposition -- and Guaido -- face critical test in vote...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Venezuela-s-opposition-and-Juan-Guaid-face-a-14949403.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CARACAS, Venezuela - Venezuela's opposition faces a critical test on Sunday, when its leader, Juan Guaidó, will seek reelection as head of the National Assembly - a title that forms the basis of his recognition as Venezuela's true head of state by nearly 60 countries around the globe.  For Guaidó, the vote amounts to a do-or-die moment. One year ago, he declared President Nicolás Maduro a usurper for claiming victory in tainted elections and declared himself Venezuela's rightful leader - an assertion based on Guaidó's status as head of the assembly. But after a year of failed attempts to oust Maduro, Guaidó is now struggling to maintain opposition unity, confronting flagging domestic support and scrambling to counter an alleged plot against him.  Maduro's socialist government has sought to thwart Guaidó's reelection by allegedly bribing and intimidating lawmakers to turn against him. Should enough of them abandon Guaidó on Sunday, the Washington-backed 36-year-old would no longer be able to defend his presidential claim as being rooted in the Venezuelan constitution.  "It would create an international disruption and put us in a very critical situation," said Luis Stefanelli, a Venezuelan lawmaker now living in exile in the United States. "We need Guaidó there. The government knows it."  Discovery of the alleged plot last month, Guaidó loyalists say, has helped them to counter it. And they are cautiously optimistic about Guaidó's reelection. In an effort designed to enhance his chances, U.S. officials in recent weeks have privately reiterated their support of Guaidó to major players within the Venezuelan opposition, according to three people familiar with the effort.  In addition, opposition officials have authorized pro-Guaidó lawmakers in exile to vote remotely on Sunday, ensuring a larger pool of votes and...</description>
