      <title>Impeachment over, but Trump and Roberts aren't done with each other...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Impeachment-is-over-but-Trump-and-Chief-Justice-15034863.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has gotten an earful about President Donald Trump while presiding over the president's impeachment trial, and received a few words from the man himself Tuesday night at the State of the Union address.  The trial may be over, but these two are hardly done with each other.  Currently, the chief justice is either writing or reviewing the Supreme Court's decision on whether Trump acted within his power to end the program protecting young immigrant "dreamers" from deportation. A decision could come at any time before its term concludes at the end of June.  Next month, Roberts will call the court to order to decide whether Trump may shield his personal financial information from a congressional committee and New York prosecutor each investigating matters beyond the president's impeachment.  It ensures that controversies over investigations into Trump's conduct will continue into the heart of the presidential election campaign.  And on and on it will go.  Trump's expansive view of his powers has met an unprecedented legal pushback from Democrats and civil rights organizations, and the president's lawyers have not hesitated to run quickly to the conservative Supreme Court, which they see as a counterbalance to liberal federal judges.  Even as Roberts presided one day at the trial, the Supreme Court on a 5-to-4 vote granted an emergency request allowing the Trump administration to begin implementing new rules making it easier to deny immigrants residency or admission to the United States because they have used or might use public-assistance programs.  Roberts, who marked his 65th birthday attempting to "carry out ill-defined responsibilities in an unfamiliar setting," invited lawmakers to visit, saying the front row of the court is...</description>

      <title>Bloomberg seizes on turmoil to make his mark with voters...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Bloomberg-seizes-on-turmoil-to-make-his-mark-with-15033855.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DETROIT - On the morning after the Iowa caucuses, as the nation awoke to news of another electoral debacle, Mike Bloomberg stood on a stage in an old warehouse here, feigning little concern.  "I hear something happened in Iowa - or didn't happen, I don't know which," the billionaire and former New York City mayor told the crowd, adding that he had been asleep on a plane to Michigan as the results were supposed to be coming in.  When he awoke, Bloomberg recalled, he asked someone the outcome, "and the guy said, 'Nothing.' I still can't figure it out."  While the rest of the Democratic field tries to recover from Iowa and pivot to New Hampshire, Bloomberg is seizing the moment to gain an advantage - doubling his television spending in key states, expanding his staff to more than 2,000, and traveling the country to introduce himself as a competent and accomplished manager.  The sheer size and machine-like efficiency of Bloomberg's campaign, for which he has already paid more than $200 million of his own fortune, is distinct compared with the troubling performance of party leaders in Iowa and stumbling by former vice president Joe Biden.  Bloomberg, 77, began his campaign too late to qualify for the early primary states that often make or break presidential candidates. Instead, he has focused on delegate-rich Super Tuesday states, which will vote in early March, hoping to nudge Biden aside as the moderate alternative to Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg, who finished strong in Iowa, is also vying for the moderate mantle.  Bloomberg in recent weeks has rolled out repeated endorsements, including from several prominent African American mayors. His TV ads are airing in 27 states, including California, Michigan, Florida and Texas. And he is now in fourth...</description>

      <title>Desperate Biden lashes out...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/893878/biden-dares-buttigieg-call-obama-administration-failure</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Vice President Joe Biden got candid on Wednesday in New Hampshire. He admitted to his supporters that his campaign 'took a gut punch' in Iowa, as results â€” which are incomplete and preliminary â€” have him in fourth place. He wasn't completely pessimistic, though, pointing out he's taken similar hits before (for what it's worth, he never recovered from his Iowa struggles in past presidential bids) and that he's staying in the race regardless. In Somersworth, N,H., @JoeBiden responds to @PeteButtigieg for calling him part of the â€œold failed Washingtonâ€� by listing Obama-era accomplishments. â€œIs he really saying the Obama Biden administration was a failure? Pete, just say it out loud.â€™â€™ â€” Janet Hook (@hookjan) February 5, 2020 He also went after former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who looks like he has a good shot at emerging victorious once the dust finally settles in Iowa. Buttigieg had earlier described Biden as a member of the 'old failed Washington,' which prompted Biden to dare his younger competitor to take his criticism a step further and direct it at former President Barack Obama. Buttigieg so far hasn't taken up the offer. In Somersworth, N,H., @JoeBiden responds to @PeteButtigieg for calling him part of the â€œold failed Washingtonâ€� by listing Obama-era accomplishments. â€œIs he really saying the Obama Biden administration was a failure? Pete, just say it out loud.â€™â€™ â€” Janet Hook (@hookjan) February 5, 2020 Biden wasn't done there. He kept on the offensive and also targeted Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who he said would bind all Democrats to the Democratic-Socialist label should the party nominate the senator. Tim O'Donnell</description>
