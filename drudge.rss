      <title>STUDY: Excessive brain activity shortens life...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Excessive-brain-activity-linked-to-a-shorter-life-14540961.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One key to a longer life could be a quieter brain without too much neural activity, according to a new study that examined postmortem brain tissue from extremely long-lived people for clues about what made them different from people who died in their 60s and 70s.  "Use it or lose it" has dominated thinking on how to protect the aging brain, and extensive research shows there are many benefits to remaining physically and mentally active as people get older. But the study, published in the journal Nature, suggests more isn't always better. Excessive activity - at least at the level of brain cells - could be harmful.  "The completely shocking and puzzling thing about this new paper is . . . [brain activity] is what you think of as keeping you cognitively normal. There's the idea that you want to keep your brain active in later life," said Michael McConnell, a neuroscientist at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, who was not involved in the study. "The thing that is super unexpected is . . . limiting neural activity is a good thing in healthy aging. It's very counterintuitive."  Researchers at Harvard Medical School analyzed brain tissue donated to human brain banks by people ranging in age from their 60s and 70s to centenarians who lived to be 100 or older. They found people who died before their mid-80s had lower levels in their brains of a protein called REST that tamps down genes involved in sparking brain activity, compared to the very oldest people. REST had already been shown to be protective against Alzheimer's disease. But they weren't sure whether REST somehow protected people from death or was just a sign of further aging.  Since it is not currently possible to measure REST in the brains of living people, the scientists began experiments in roundworms and mice to test whether it plays a role in life span....</description>

      <title>Buttigieg performance gets enthusiastic applause -- from right...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/872016/pete-buttigiegs-debate-performance-gets-enthusiastic-applause--from-conservatives</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fourth Democratic debate will be make-or-break for many of the 12 candidates on stage Tuesday night, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg made sure to leave an impression. Curiously, though, he specifically drew praise from conservatives by pulling to the right of his more progressive opponents. "Buttigieg, who opened with a civility pitch but got lost in the progressive shuffle, clearly sees an opening in the center again," tweeted American Conservative editor and The Week contributor Jim Antle. Liz Mair, a libertarian and Republican communications strategist, praised Buttigieg's answer to an impeachment question that came early in the debate, when the mayor observed that after an inquiry, "think about where we'll be â€” vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now." Really good answer from Buttigieg on impeachment. Really, really good. â€” Liz Mair (@LizMair) October 16, 2019 Jennifer Rubin, a conservative writer for The Washington Post, marveled at Buttigieg's performance, tweeting that the mayor was "hitting this out of the park, out of the town." Matt Lewis, a conservative columnist at The Daily Beast, added: "I don't pretend to know how this exchange plays on the left, but ... Pete Buttigieg is winning this debate." The daughter of the late Republican Sen. John McCain, Meghan McCain, also cheered Buttigieg when he pushed back on former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's gun buyback proposal: Yesssss Mayor @PeteButtigieg! Finish him!!!!!!!! Beto and his insane gun buyback rhetoric which is completely implausible and unconstitutional. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/H5PRnoxr8L â€” Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) October 16, 2019 Many Democrats were, needless to say, less thrilled by Mayor Pete. "Buttigieg is getting closer to clinching the Republican nomination," quipped Farron Cousins, a co-host of the progressive Ring of Fire talk show. Jeva Lange</description>
