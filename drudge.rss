      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Screams echoed. American flags waved menacingly. Fireworks and flashbang grenades shook the downtown streets. Fists and feet started swinging. On June 30, as a faceoff between opposite ends of the political spectrum exploded into a street fight, enforcement in Portland, Oregon, jumped into action. The march, organized by Patriot Prayer, a far-right outfit with a history of sparking conflict, was met by anti-fascist - antifa - and other-counter protesters. As the clash escalated, the event was declared a riot. Officers in body armor tried to unknot the scuffles. Four people left the scene in ambulances, the Portland Police later said in a statement. Four others left in handcuffs.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As old social media posts have resurfaced and prominent athletes have been forced into public soul-baring in recent weeks, sports agents have undertaken emergency Twitter work, carefully excavating, scrutinizing and, if need be, deleting youthful indiscretions and ignorance. Agents across multiple sports say recent headlines have prompted athletes to delve into their Twitter histories, searching for anything offensive or controversial that might have been sitting forgotten and unnoticed. One NBA team even reached out to representatives of all its players this week, according to an agent, urging them "to do a deep dive" through social media histories.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I walked into a party on a recent Thursday night, I was self-conscious in a way I'd never been before: What if no one likes the way I smell? It's summer in Washington, D.C., so no one smells all that great. But this night was different from your average gathering of sweaty bodies. I was about to enter a pheromone party, where strangers would be inhaling my scent via a T-shirt I'd been wearing. It's a fun if strange experiment. Singles are meeting in lots of odd ways these days. Perhaps sampling each other's DNA the way you might go wine-tasting makes more sense than swiping through photos on a dating app.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The historic Shuttle Meadow Country Club in Kensington, Connecticut, sprawls over nearly 400 acres of land. Surrounded by dense forests and rolling hills, the club's picturesque 18-hole course is a golfer's dream. About 14 years ago, New Britain police made a grim discovery there. Responding to a report of human remains on Aug. 27, 2004, police arrived to find part of a leg, severed so cleanly that they could only come to one conclusion: someone had been killed. The source of the leg would remain a mystery until 2016, according to a recently released arrest warrant.</description>
