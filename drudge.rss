      <title>Living in parallel-universes... </title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Expecting-a-sea-change-on-impeachment-Here-s-14557399.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - With every new revelation in the House impeachment inquiry, some Democrats believe Republicans have finally reached a breaking point and will somehow abandon President Donald Trump.  "This is a sea change," Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., told reporters after Tuesday's explosive deposition of William Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine.  By Wednesday morning, the seas had indeed changed. Rather than abandoning Trump, several dozen House Republicans who are not members of the committees leading the inquiry marched into a secure briefing room and effectively shuttered the investigation for several hours.  What's driving this seemingly parallel-universe behavior? Probably the fact that, in many ways, their voters are living in parallel universes when it comes to what they expect of their politicians when it comes to civility and compromise.  A new study published Wednesday by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service demonstrates just how angry voters are at lawmakers on the opposite end of the political spectrum. This "civility poll" sought to find out how much voters of all stripes care about the tenor of today's politics and whether they want leaders in Washington to reach compromise.  The top-line result is particularly alarming, with a majority of Americans now believing the nation is on "the edge of a civil war." But the research provided plenty of explanation for why a Democrat like Lynch expects "a sea change" and why a Republican like Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida organized the GOP insurrection.  Ask the question one way and it almost looks as if America is a remarkably united nation: 88 percent of voters are "frustrated by the uncivil and rude behavior" in Washington, 87 percent believe compromise "should be the goal for political leaders" and 84 percent believe behavior that used to...</description>

      <title>How Beltway power couple, political newcomer learned to thrive in Trump era...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/How-a-Beltway-power-couple-and-a-political-14556168.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - When Brad Parscale was looking for advice about how to navigate Washington, D.C., after running the digital strategy for Donald Trump's upstart presidential campaign in 2016, the brash political newcomer turned to a Beltway power couple.  Katie Walsh and Mike Shields, both former chiefs of staff at the Republican National Committee, advised him on how to make the most of his new perch, he said.  Since then, the three have helped each other flourish inside the Republican Party ecosystem, recommending each other's services to top GOP officials and candidates. Together, the trio have broad influence across the party - drawing millions of dollars from 23 party committees and organizations since the beginning of 2017, according to campaign finance filings and people familiar with their work.  Their dominance has alarmed other Republican Party strategists, who say the three have a disproportionate amount of sway - and have helped each other sustain that power, according to multiple people with knowledge of their roles.  The symbiotic relationship between Parscale - who as Trump's 2020 campaign manager regularly attacks the "Washington swamp" - and the low-profile GOP establishment couple speaks to how longtime party figures have acclimated to and benefited from the Trump era.  "Who else do I trust more than myself? The two people that I saw day after day, saying really smart things to me all the time, saying, 'Hey, Brad, you may think about this,' and they end up being right," Parscale said in an interview. "It has nothing to do with money. It was trust."  Since 2017, three businesses controlled by Walsh and Shields - including two companies formed after Trump's election - have collected $12.6 million from GOP political committees and politically active groups, according to campaign filings and tax records.

      <title>ANXIETY GROWS OVER 2020 PROSPECTS</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Democrats-see-weak-spots-in-their-own-2020-14554735.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - When the 2020 Democratic presidential contest kicked off earlier this year, the massive field was hailed as the most diverse in history, with candidates who spanned the ideological spectrum and offered enough in a broad buffet of options to entice any voter. But after 10 months of campaigning and 15 hours of nationally televised debates, another emotion is rising: anxiety.  Party leaders and activists are citing weakness in all of the leading contenders, including former vice president Joe Biden, who has been forced on the defensive about his family's ethics, performed haltingly in debates and set off alarms with his poor fundraising. They also fret that the two other top-ranking candidates, Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., are too liberal to win a general election. Other candidates have had moments to shine, but none yet has fully transformed that into anything approaching momentum.  Oprah Winfrey, an early backer of Barack Obama who was initially enthusiastic about former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, has repeatedly begged Disney CEO Bob Iger to jump into the race. Hillary Clinton, according to two people close to her, has not ruled out jumping in herself, a sign that she is hearing similar dissatisfaction.  "You can imagine much stronger candidates," said Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic National Committee member. She pines for Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who declined to run, or an outsider like retired admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.  John Coale, a major donor to both Bill and Hillary Clinton, was more blunt. "They don't have anybody who can win the general [election]," he said.  In conversations with 17 state and national party leaders, nearly all expressed some level of unease with where the field stands and a...</description>
