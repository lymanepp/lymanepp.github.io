      <title>200,000 seafarers fear there's no plan to get them off ships...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/200-000-seafarers-fear-there-s-no-plan-to-get-15396336.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like thousands of other seafarers, Karika Neethling wanted to get home as the coronavirus pandemic convulsed the cruise industry in March. Her anxiety grew more desperate when she learned she was pregnant.  But for nearly three months, the 27-year-old South African was caught in a web of border restrictions and corporate bureaucracy, shuttled on ships between ports in the Bahamas and Italy as her employer, MSC Cruises, worked to get its crews home.  "I don't think we were ever priorities," said Neethling, who worked as a shop employee aboard the luxury liner the MSC Preziosa. "I was depressed and in despair thinking I might have this baby on the ship."  Neethling isn't alone. While she's finally home in Johannesburg, more than 200,000 more seafarers remain trapped on ships around the world, from cargo vessels and oil tankers to luxury cruise liners. Restrictions on ships docking to halt the spread of Covid-19, border shutdowns and a lack of flights are the biggest barriers to relieving exhausted crew. But shipping lines and cruise companies are also coming under increasing pressure to do more.  MSC said it's been working with governments and ports to get workers home as quickly as possible, prioritizing pregnant seafarers. The company said in a statement that a "small number" of pregnant crew members across its fleet "have had to stay on board awaiting repatriation despite our best efforts to secure safe passage home for them."  How much responsibility companies bear for workers trapped at sea is a growing point of contention. That leaves one of the world's most vulnerable working populations, some who have been stuck on board for more than a year, at increased risk and could have a knock-on effect that reverberates through the shipping industry and global economy.  "Pressure to change crew has increased dramatically,"...</description>

      <title>Senate GOP candidates in tight races avoid any mention of president in campaign ads...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Senate-GOP-candidates-in-tight-races-avoid-any-15396155.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his most recent television ad, Colorado's Cory Gardner cheerfully touts an outdoor conservation bill he recently wrote. Arizona's Martha McSally denounces "communist China" in her 30-second clips. And North Carolina's Thom Tillis showcases his humble roots in a trailer park as he vows to protect jobs for American workers.  Missing from the spate of ads: President Donald Trump.  Republican senators up for reelection this fall in tight races have been unwilling to publicly criticize Trump as he continues to fan racial tensions and struggles to control a pandemic that has devastated the economy and killed close to 130,000 Americans. But they are being careful not to embrace him either.  In their campaign ads back home, it's as if the unpopular incumbent president doesn't exist, as Republicans choose instead to highlight their own achievements or go on the attack against their Democratic challengers.  This deliberate approach underscores the difficult position Republicans find themselves in as they head into an election season that looks increasingly grim for the party. The senators don't want to clash with Trump and rile up his stable of loyal supporters whose votes they will need to be reelected, but they also don't want to hug him tightly him and turn off more moderate voters whose views of the president have turned negative.  "The sweet spot is finding real ways to show your independence and to do it in ways that don't antagonize the base," said Republican strategist Matt Gorman, vice president at the GOP consulting firm Targeted Victory.  It's a balancing act that could give even a tightrope walker vertigo.  Trump's sagging popularity is one of several challenges confronting Senate Republicans as they face a dire outlook in their bid to retain the majority this fall....</description>

President Trump, mired in some of the lowest job approval ratings of his presidency, is trailing Biden by significant margins in key battleground states like Pennsylvania (8 points), Michigan (9 points), and Wisconsin (9 points). He’s even running behind Biden in his firewall states of Florida and North Carolina.</description>

      <title>Pandemic shutdowns saved thousands of animals from becoming roadkill...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Pandemic-shutdowns-saved-thousands-of-animals-15393589.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Covid-19 has taken more than a half-million human lives. A new report says it may have saved the lives of thousands of wild animals, if only temporarily.  As states across the country enforced stay-at-home orders from early March to mid-April, road traffic decreased by about 70% in California, Idaho and Maine, researchers found. At the same time, the number of car crashes involving deer, bears and other large mammals also dropped across all three states.  Maine recorded 44 percent fewer roadkill victims, according to the report from the University of California at Davis. California's deaths-by-bumper dropped 58% for mountain lions, and 21% overall. If a similar drop occurred across the United States, where some estimates suggest as many as 1 billion wild animals are killed by vehicles each year, about 200 million creatures' lives would be spared annually.  "That's a huge, huge benefit to wildlife populations across the country," said Fraser Shilling, co-director of the Road Ecology Center at UC Davis, who helped produce the report - which, he emphasized, does not suggest that the global pandemic has been a good thing.  "From a humanity point of view, it sucks," Shilling said. "But from a science point of view, it's all interesting."  The report relied on data collected regularly by the three states' departments of transportation, highway patrol units and wildlife agencies. With information dating back to 2015, the scientists were able to compare what happened during shutdowns in each state to normal roadkill numbers. They found no significant difference between what happened before or after the stay-at-home orders, but during that low-activity window, the results were striking.  In just California, Idaho and Maine, the declines would translate to 13,000 fewer large mammal...</description>

      <title>Chief Justice John Roberts hospitalized last month after injuring his head in  fall...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/High-court-Chief-justice-hospitalized-last-month-15392894.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. suffered a fall at a Maryland country club last month that required an overnight stay in the hospital, a Supreme Court spokeswoman confirmed Tuesday night.  The 65-year-old chief justice was taken by ambulance to a hospital after the June 21 incident at the Chevy Chase Club, which was serious enough to require sutures. He stayed at the hospital overnight for observation and was released the next morning.  Roberts has twice experienced seizures, in 1993 and in 2007, but Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said doctors ruled out that possibility in the latest incident. Doctors believe he was dehydrated, she said.  Roberts did not publicly disclose the matter, and the court's confirmation came in response to an inquiry from The Washington Post, which received a tip.  The scene was apparently witnessed by some at the club, whose list of politically connected members includes another justice, Brett Kavanaugh. The person who told The Post about the incident said Roberts's head was covered in blood.  The statement from Arberg said: "The Chief Justice was treated at a hospital on June 21 for an injury to his forehead sustained in a fall while walking for exercise near his home. The injury required sutures, and out of an abundance of caution, he stayed in the hospital overnight and was discharged the next morning. His doctors ruled out a seizure. They believe the fall was likely due to light-headedness caused by dehydration."  The statement did not address why Roberts had not disclosed his hospitalization.  Roberts suffered a seizure in July 2007 at his vacation home in Maine. He fell from a dock after experiencing what the court described as a "benign idiopathic seizure." That means there was no easily identifiable cause for the...</description>
