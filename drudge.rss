      <title>Silicon Valley coming for your house...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Silicon-Valley-Is-Coming-for-Your-House-13824737.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In today's on-demand digital world, buying and selling a home remains stubbornly, painfully analog. Most sales still begin with a real estate agent (and a 6% commission). Most still end in an office, with the two sides signing page after page of legalese.  Silicon Valley wants to change that. Tech companies have begun to nibble away at the edges of the residential real estate industry, offering virtual open houses, digital closings and other services. Now they are coming straight for the real estate transaction itself through "instant buying," in which companies buy homes, perform some light maintenance and put them back on the market.  Established companies like Zillow and venture-backed upstarts like Opendoor and Offerpad have raised billions of dollars on the promise that they can use sophisticated algorithms to predict the value of individual homes. They contend that those predictions, combined with old-fashioned economies of scale, will allow them to be far more efficient than traditional home flippers.  The companies and their backers say they are doing what tech is best at: bringing efficiency and convenience to a process not known for either. Silicon Valley has already upended the way we hail a cab and order takeout, they argue. Why not improve a transaction that even well-educated professionals find intimidating?  "You should be able to sell a home within a handful of clicks," said Eric Wu, Opendoor's chief executive.  But houses are not taxicabs. A bad Uber ride might set a user back $20 and make her late for a meeting. A house is the largest asset for most Americans and the most expensive purchase they will ever make.  At best, skeptics see instant buying, also known as "iBuying," as an overhyped, capital-intensive business whose explosive growth...</description>

      <title>Starr Comes For 'Whiny' Mueller!</title>
      <link>https://www.mediaite.com/tv/ken-starr-comes-for-robert-mueller-committed-an-unforgivable-sin-with-whiny-leaked-letter-to-ag-barr/</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mediaite.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With rare exception, special counsel Robert Mueller has emerged from the past two years unscathed -- seemingly immune to cable news criticism. But on Monday, one man who previously ran a high-profile independent investigation of a president came after him with a blistering take. Appearing on The Story, Ken Starr -- the man who led the investigation into former President Bill Clinton in the late '90s -- shredded Mueller for his letter to Attorney General William Barr, which took the AG to task for his four-page Mueller Report summary. "His letter, that was then leaked on the very eve of Bill Barr's testimony, was essentially, I believe, an unfair, whiny complaint," Starr told Fox's Martha MacCallum. "Whiny" was just the beginning of Starr's blistering critique. The former independent counsel went on to refer to the leaked letter as an "unforgivable sin" against Barr. "Here comes Bob Mueller with this letter which is then leaked. That is, to me, the unforgivable sin," Starr said. "He,</description>

      <title>'Sorcerer' promised to help people find love. Instead, orchestrated 'witchcraft extortion scheme'...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-sorcerer-promised-to-help-people-find-love-13825060.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The love ritual began with candles, alcohol, vegetables and photographs, all carefully arranged. Then clients were told to send photos and videos of themselves reciting graphic statements and performing sex acts to a Paraguayan business specializing in witchcraft to finish the magic spell aimed at finding a soul mate.  That's when a self-described sorcerer started another familiar rite: extortion.  Ariel Boiteux, an Argentine national who masterminded an international scheme that entangled an estimated 200 victims in at least 12 countries, threatened to post the photos and videos of the intimate acts unless his clients paid "large sums of money," according to authorities, sometimes demanding six-figure payoffs. Boiteux, 31, and associates with his company, Amarres Inmediatos, even posted some explicit content to websites, Facebook and Instagram and forced clients to pay to take down the posts.  But as the alleged warlock of witchcraft extortion learned this week, there were no tricks in his bag of distorted magic that could get him out prison.  The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of California announced Monday that Boiteux was sentenced to two years in federal prison for the crime of foreign transmission of an extortionate threat. He pleaded guilty in December after being extradited from Paraguay to San Diego last July, the Los Angeles Times reported.  "This was a despicable scheme that preyed upon people who put their trust in a phony," U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer Jr. said in a news release on Monday. "This defendant used the vulnerability of the lovelorn to humiliate and extort them, and for that he will pay a price."  Authorities in Paraguay said that the estimated 200 victims hailed from the United States, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Italy, Mexico, Peru,...</description>

      <title>Are we watching John Bolton's last stand?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Are-we-watching-John-Bolton-s-last-stand-13824655.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is John Bolton about to get the Iran war he's always wanted, or is he on the verge of losing his job?  Over the past several days, President Trump's national security adviser has made comments and issued statements about Iran and Venezuela that are usually reserved for the run-up to military campaigns.  Yet Bolton's boss doesn't seem to be playing along.  On Sunday, the White House released a statement, attributed to Bolton, that the United States is deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Persian Gulf. The aim: "to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force." The message added: "The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces."  A U.S. official said the deployment was in response to "clear indications" of a "possible attack" by Iran or its proxies.  Although Tehran announced on Monday that it would restart some of its suspended nuclear activities to mark the year anniversary of the U.S. departure from its commitments, for its part, the Iranian regime isn't taking Bolton's bait yet.  Last month, the United States designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization; Tehran predictably responded by branding all U.S. forces in the Middle East as terrorists in turn. Aside from their rhetoric, however, the Iranians have made no other visible moves to ratchet up tensions between the two countries.  Meanwhile, in recent weeks Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has been signaling his government's desire to negotiate a new nuclear deal with...</description>

      <title>TUMULTY:  PRESIDENT IS TROLLING US AGAIN, STOP FALLING FOR IT!</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/opinion/article/Trump-is-trolling-us-again-so-stop-falling-for-it-13823344.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump has a superpower. With just a few taps to the screen of his iPhone, he can transform his staunchest adversaries into . . . Donald Trump.  No one loves a good conspiracy theory as much as the man in the Oval Office. Indeed, that is how he launched his political career. He was the chief propagator for a shameful lie that the nation's first blackpresident was not born in this country.  He continues to gin up new ones. But in addition to using them to stir his own base, Trump has become highly effective at fomenting preposterous scenarios that send his opposition into a conspiratorial frenzy.  The latest example came over the weekend, when Trump retweeted an obvious, if lame, joke by one of his most devoted sycophants.  "After the best week ever for @realDonaldTrump - no obstruction, no collusion, NYT admits @BarackObama did spy on his campaign, &amp; the economy is soaring," Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, wrote. "I now support reparations - Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup."  Reparations - get it? Falwell was sucking up to the president, distorting the results of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possibly illegal effort to obstruct the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and making a racially insensitive reference to redressing the abomination of slavery. It was a three-fer, in less than 240 characters.  Trump himself continued the trolling with a tweet that read: "they have stolen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back."  Traditional and social media took the bait, as Trump surely knew they would.  Out of that tweet came a torrent of speculation about the extralegal...</description>
