For the past two years, Giselle Palmer has been shooting adult films in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, the epicenter of the porn industry. Then at the beginning of this year, she started hearing about the coronavirus . It was, she says, a large part of her decision to move away from L.A. back home to Texas and stop shooting scenes for a while.  "I've shifted my focus to content platforms and streaming; things I can do with no physical contact with other performers. And I'm pretty happy with that decision," she tells Rolling Stone . "I think I'm gonna wait until we have a better idea of how this will play out."

      <title>COVERUP IN BEIJING: Chinese whistleblowers say virus recovery 'fake, it's all fake' ...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/900488/chinas-coronavirus-recovery-all-fake-whistleblowers-residents-claim</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;China's claims of how it's handling coronavirus recovery should be taken with more than a few grains of salt. Even before COVID-19 became a global crisis, Chinese leaders had been criticized for their handling of the situation and lack of transparency about the disease's progression. Things now look like they're on the upswing, and businesses even appear to be headed back to work â€” but whistleblowers and local officials tell Caixan that's just a carefully crafted ruse. Beijing has spent much of the outbreak pushing districts to carry on business as usual, with some local governments subsidizing electricity costs and even installing mandatory productivity quotas. Zhejiang, an province east of the epicenter city of Wuhan, claimed as of Feb. 24 it had restored 98.6 percent of its pre-coronavirus work capacity. But civil servants tell Caixan that businesses are actually faking these numbers. Beijing had started checking Zhejiang businesses' electricity consumption levels, so district officials ordered the companies to start leaving their lights and machinery on all day to drive the numbers up, one civil servant said. Businesses have reportedly falsified staff attendance logs as well â€” they 'would rather waste a small amount of money on power than irritate local officials,' Caixan writes. In Wuhan, officials have tried to make it appear that recovery efforts are going smoothly. But when 'central leaders' personally survey disinfecting regimens and food delivery, local officials 'make a special effort' for them and them alone, one resident told Caixan. And in a video circulating on social media, residents can be seen shouting at visiting leaders from the apartments where they're being quarantined â€” 'Fake, it's all fake.' Read more at Caixan.

      <title>KUDLOW: STAY AT WORK...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/900423/white-house-economic-adviser-larry-kudlow-claims-coronavirus-contained-says-americans-should-stay-work</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump's economic adviser Larry Kudlow is continuing to claim the COVID-19 coronavirus is 'contained' as the number of cases in the United States passes 230 across 21 states. Kudlow in an interview with CNBC on Friday said he will 'argue' the new virus has been 'contained' in the U.S., repeating the assertion he made last week as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was warning that the new virus could soon severely disrupt everyday life. 'We don't actually know what the magnitude of the virus is going to be, although frankly, so far, it looks relatively contained,' Kudlow told CNBC on Friday. '...The vast majority of Americans are not at risk of this virus.' Kudlow also said 'America should stay at work,' arguing that the private sector is 'going to solve this disease' and again reiterating, 'I will still argue to you that this is contained. It can't be airtight, but ... in a relative sense, relative to our population, relative to ordinary flus ... I think it is relatively contained.' CNBC host David Faber challenged Kudlow on his claims throughout the interview, at one point telling him that the coronavirus is 'much more serious than the flu, as you know.' Faber also told Kudlow that 'it's very hard to say whether it really is in any way contained or whether we are not all at risk,' to which Kudlow responded, 'Well, I'm not sure where you're going on that.'

      <title>TAX CUTS TO EASE PAIN?</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/White-House-looking-at-tax-deferral-for-airline-15110808.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Friday the administration may propose "timely and targeted" federal interventions to help workers, firms and industries hurt by the coronavirus, as fears mount over the growing economic impact of the spreading outbreak in the U.S.  White House officials are considering deferring taxes for industries hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, including the cruise, travel and airline industries, among other things, two people briefed on the discussions said. The talks remain fluid and preliminary.  His comments were the most definitive a White House official had made so far about offering government assistance to companies that had been adversely impacted. For several weeks, White House officials had mostly minimized the economic impact of the outbreak and said it would be short-lived.  Speaking on CNBC and Fox Business, Kudlow rejected suggestions of a larger stimulus package in part because he claimed that the virus is largely "contained" and the U.S. economy remains strong.  But Kudlow said Friday the U.S. government may provide help to certain sectors, such as the hospitality and airline industries. The federal government may also step in and help people in certain parts of the country forced to stay at home because of coronavirus, as well as small business who may need "cash flow" help amid the outbreak, according to Kudlow.  The Dow Jones industrial average initially fell more than 700 points on Friday amid a turbulent week, but it rebounded slightly as Kudlow spoke on television.  "What we are looking at...is a timely and targeted micro approach," Kudlow told Fox Business Network's Stuart Varney. He added Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the National Economic Council are in touch with President Trump about potential responses. "We want targeted, in a timely...</description>

      <title>SOUTHWEST CEO warns plunging domestic travel has '9/11-like feel'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/900284/southwest-airlines-ceo-warns-dropoff-domestic-travel-over-coronavirus-911like-feel</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mounting concern over the new coronavirus outbreak has caused school closures and movie premiere pushbacks, and now the crisis' effect on the aviation industry is drawing comparisons to 9/11. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly told CNBC on Thursday that the company has lost several hundred million dollars in a week's time thanks to a decline in bookings amid increasing fears over COVID-19. Kelly added that the drop-off was 'noticeable' and 'precipitous' and has continued declining on a daily basis. When prompted by CNBC's Phil LeBeau over whether the drop was reminiscent of former dips in demand spurred by the 2003 SARS outbreak or the events of Sept. 11, 2001, Kelly said the new coronavirus outbreak was more like the latter. 'It has a 9/11-like feel,' Kelly said. He explained that post-9/11 travel fallout was motivated by 'fear' rather than being economically driven, saying fear is 'really what's manifested this time' with the new coronavirus outbreak. Kelly told LeBeau he thought the dip in bookings was an 'overreaction' but that Southwest is financially prepared to handle the fallout. The outbreak's effect has been felt heavily in the U.S. stock market, which has rotated between sinking and soaring over the last week, and it has caused at least 11 U.S. deaths and four states to declare emergencies.
