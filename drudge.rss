      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.asiaone.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TOKYO - A Japanese city has been left fighting off wannabe ninjas after a news report on local labour shortages that suggested it wanted to hire the traditional assassins went viral. The western city of Iga was featured in a report by American radio station NPR this month about Japan's depopulation and labour shortage problems. The report said Iga was trying to capitalise on its history as home to ninjas by building a new museum focused on the warriors, but was struggling to hire staff, including ninja performers.</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/HBO-aims-to-stem-customer-churn-13102086.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's never been easier to sit down on the couch, pay for a month of HBO and then power through an entire season's worth of "Westworld" or "Game of Thrones" before canceling the service in hopes of avoiding further credit card charges. But while that clever approach might be saving consumers money in an age of ubiquitous cord-cutting and online streaming, it doesn't work out so well for HBO, which has to deal with inconsistent subscription rates. In the coming months, HBO will try to stem that constant customer churn by enticing more viewers to stick with the premium channel year-round, according to John Stankey, the head of HBO's parent company, WarnerMedia.</description>

      <title>Republicans ready new cuts... </title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/business/article/House-Republicans-ready-new-tax-cut-package-aim-13101752.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - House Republicans unveiled the broad outlines of a new tax package Tuesday that would make individual rate cuts permanent under the nation's revised tax code, instead of allowing them to expire in 2025.  The proposal stands little chance in the Senate. Nonetheless House Republicans intend to bring it to a vote ahead of the November midterm elections, with the aim of refocusing attention on what they say are positive impacts from a new tax law that has not proven particularly popular with voters. Some also hope that the vote will put Democrats on the spot, by forcing them to vote for or against extending tax cuts for individuals after months of railing against the tax law as a giveaway for corporations.</description>

      <title>Find your passion? That's bad advice, scientists say...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Find-your-passion-That-s-bad-advice-scientists-13100194.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Find your passion" is a mantra dictated to everyone from college students to retirees to pretty much anyone seeking happiness. But according to a forthcoming study from Stanford and Yale-NUS College in Singapore, it's actually bad advice - and may actually make it harder for people to figure out what they love to do. Why? The idea of "finding" one's passion implies that people have built-in interests just waiting to be discovered, and if you can simply figure out what they are you will magically be able to embrace them, says the study, which will be published in the journal Psychological Science. But people with that mind-set are more likely to give up on their newfound interest when they hit the inevitable roadblock, the study found.</description>
