      <title>Frustrated by unpopularity with Jews, thrusts Israel into culture war...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Frustrated-by-unpopularity-with-Jews-Trump-14369952.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump decided long ago that it would be smart politics for him to yoke his administration to Israel and to try to brand the Democratic Party as anti-Semitic.  He set about executing a pro-Israel checklist: Moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing the Golan Heights as part of sovereign Israel and taking a hard line against Iran. And he promoted himself as the greatest president ever - a deity even - for Jewish people.  Yet Trump has become flummoxed that Jewish Americans are not in turn lining up to support his reelection, according to people familiar with his thinking, and he has lashed out in predictable fashion.  "If you vote for a Democrat, you're very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people," Trump said Wednesday on the South Lawn of the White House. He was amplifying a statement he made in the Oval Office a day earlier: "I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty."  Trump's use of the word "disloyalty" drew immediate criticism from Jewish groups, whose leaders said it echoed anti-Semitic tropes about where American Jews' loyalty lies. The president insisted his comments were not anti-Semitic.  Regardless, this turn in the president's rhetoric about Jews magnifies his transactional approach to politics and his miscalculation that his support for Israel should automatically translate into electoral support from Jewish Americans.  It also reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the motivations of many Jews, who are not a monolithic voting bloc and but rather prioritize a wide range of issues - not only Israel, but also education, the economy and the environment, as well as civility and morality.  "He is reflecting a concept of Jewish Americans...</description>

      <title>Soccer star drilled 55-yard field goal. Hall of Famer says she should get NFL tryout...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Carli-Lloyd-drilled-a-55-yard-field-goal-A-Hall-14368449.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as Carli Lloyd was concerned, she was on just another field, doing what she does best.  The difference Tuesday was that she was on an NFL field when she pulled back her right leg and sent a ball straight and true for 55 yards, stirring up all sorts of buzz with a viral video. Lloyd, a two-time World Cup winner, twice an Olympic gold medalist and twice FIFA Player of the Year, made football look as easy as futbol as Sam Koch of the Baltimore Ravens held for her field goal attempt after a joint practice with the Philadelphia Eagles at the NovaCare Complex in Philadelphia.  Her kick was money. So much so that it got one veteran NFL observer musing about whether the time was approaching when a woman might kick for an NFL team. "Honestly, I don't think it will be long before we see a woman break through this NFL barrier," Gil Brandt, the Dallas Cowboys' vice president of player personnel from 1960 to 1988, tweeted.  Note that Lloyd, the 37-year-old who plays for the NWSL's Sky Blue franchise in New Jersey, wasn't facing pressure and she was taking too many approach steps. All of which was pointed out to Brandt, who countered, "I heard the same kind of things when I was bringing in track athletes and soccer players back in the '60s."  Brandt wasn't kidding and he offered a reminder of just how problematic kicking was in the NFL last season. Mason Crosby of the Green Bay Packers missed five field goal attempts in one game; Week 11 was a record-setting day for missed extra-point attempts. And perhaps no team had a more ignominious experience than the Chicago Bears, whose "double-doink" disaster occurred when Cody Parkey's potential game-winner from 43 yards out was tipped at the line, then hit the left upright and the crossbar. The Bears lost that wild-card game 16-15 to the Eagles.  The team released Parkey in the...</description>

      <title>Montana hailstorm slaughters 11,000 birds!</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Montana-hailstorm-slaughters-11-000-birds-14366687.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thousands of birds were killed on Aug. 11 when a destructive hailstorm lashed regions northwest of Billings, Montana. According to Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, the supercell thunderstorm "killed and maimed more than 11,000 waterfowl and wetland birds at the Big Lake Wildlife Management Area west of Molt." Molt is about 20 miles west-northwest of Billings, Montana's largest city.  According to the release, biologist Justin Paugh estimates that roughly a quarter of the birds at the lake were injured or killed. About 5% of surviving ducks and a third of living pelicans/cormorants "show some sign of injury or impaired movement."  The Storm Prediction Center had already been calling for potential large, damaging hail as early as 12 hours in advance, outlining Billings in a narrow corridor of "significant severe" potential. Their morning bulletin advised that volatile atmospheric parameters would "favor supercells initially with large hail and possibly a couple of tornadoes." By late afternoon, storms had developed, quickly becoming severe. Some storms towered to nearly 10 miles high.  The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Molt at 6:27 p.m., alerting of the potential for golf ball-sized hail and damaging wind gusts in excess of 60 mph. The storm proved to be an overachiever, bringing an unusual August episode of three-inch hail and winds gusting up to 74 mph.  "This isn't uncommon for us, but it normally happens in June," explained Shawn Palmquist, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Billings. "June is when we have lower freezing levels and can get hail. August is typically more a wind month."  "We only had a high of 82 degrees at Billings Airport last Sunday," said Palmquist. "That was six degrees below normal, knocking freezing levels down just a bit. We also had above...</description>

      <title>ABERNATHY:  Trump is product of narcissistic media age...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/opinion/article/Trump-is-the-product-of-a-narcissistic-media-age-14369049.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HILLSBORO, Ohio - I recently watched the 1980 presidential debate between incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter and his Republican challenger, former California governor Ronald Reagan. The debate is striking in retrospect, not because of memorable zingers (Reagan's "There you go again" barely qualifies), but because of a tone and tenor that today's audiences and TV execs would find downright tedious.  The members of the media panel didn't interrupt the candidates or inject themselves into the debate. The candidates didn't talk over each other, and neither accused his opponent of being a racist, a Russian agent, an anti-Semite, a baby-killer, a communist or a liar.  At one point, after a Reagan critique, Carter responded, "Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements." Similarly, an allegation by Carter brought this rejoinder from Reagan: "The figures that the president has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there." That's as nasty as it got.  The journalists didn't dispute the answers or try to create memorable moments for themselves, instead respecting the public's ability to decipher obfuscations. ABC News's Barbara Walters came closest to inserting herself into the fray when she observed, "I would like to say that neither candidate answered specifically the question of a specific policy for dealing with terrorism." But rather than badgering the candidates until she was satisfied, she understood that the event was not about her and moved on.  It wasn't that the political issues of four decades ago didn't lend themselves to the theatrics we see today. Reagan's proposals and gubernatorial record were regularly criticized as bad for minorities. Carter's inability to free the hostages in Iran left him vulnerable to claims of weakness and, worse, he was once menaced by a...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that just happened. Yes, President Trump, when asked about his ongoing trade war with China, deemed himself "the chosen one" when talking with reporters outside the White House on Wednesday. As Trump put it, when it comes to dealing with China's trade practices, "somebody had to do it." He then added "I am the chosen one" as he looked up to the sky. Here's the clip. Speaking about his trade war with China, Trump looks to the heavens and says, "I am the Chosen One." pic.twitter.com/mKWA9g7wzQ â€” David Mack (@davidmackau) August 21, 2019 The odd comment comes just after Trump compared himself to some kind of deity in a Wednesday morning tweet. He seemed to be watching Wayne Allyn Root's show on the conservative network Newsmax, and tweeted a quote from Root saying that "the Jewish people in Israel love [Trump] like he's the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God." And the day before, Trump accused "any Jewish people that votes for a Democrat" of having "either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty."
