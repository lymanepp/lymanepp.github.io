      <link>https://apnews.com/3d5722abc06245b4b931933f253e3743</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the year since the deadly mass shooting at a Florida high school, more and more states have passed laws making it easier to take guns away from people who may be suicidal or bent on violence against others, and courts are issuing an unprecedented number of seizure orders across the country. Supporters say these "red flag" laws are among the most promising tools to reduce the nearly 40,000 suicides and homicides by firearm each year in the U.S. Gun advocates, though, say such measures undermine their constitutional rights and can result in people being stripped of their weapons on false or vindictive accusations.</description>

      <title>NEW FLOOD OF ILLEGALS...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/After-holiday-lull-Central-American-family-13602434.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;U.S. border officials said Friday they saw an abrupt drop-off in illegal crossings during the holiday season, but the number of Central Americans arriving in family groups has returned to record levels since then. The lull in unauthorized crossings suggests some Central American migrants - and the smuggling organizations that deliver them to the border - may have taken a break or deferred the journey north until after the holidays. During the first week of January, when the extended Christmas season was still being celebrated in Mexico and Central America, the number of migrant family members taken into custody by U.S. agents fell to as low as 200 on some days, according to preliminary data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CINCINNATI (AP) — She kept her eyes on the dapper, wavy haired man who smiled, winked and exuded self-confidence as the courtroom proceedings moved along. "I don't know what it is he has, but he's fascinating," the teenage spectator explained to me at the time. "He's impressive. He just has a kind of magnetism." It was that beguiling magnetism that investigators said helped make the object of her interest — Ted Bundy — one of the nation's most prolific serial killers, with at least 30 women and girls' deaths linked to him in a multiple-state spree that spanned the late 1970s.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — CHAOS! HORROR! PANIC! BABY, IT'S HOT! Designer Jeremy Scott has always liked to make news, but with his latest collection he did it literally, drawing design inspiration from New York's tabloid headlines. Chromatically speaking, Scott's runway show Friday evening at New York Fashion Week was a very disciplined collection in all black and white; Scott usually uses a riot of bright colors and large cartoon graphics in his clothes. Here, garments were emblazoned with an artist's versions of the New York Post and the Daily News — on dresses, trousers, jackets, jumpsuits and much more. Some of the most striking items: dainty, elegant chiffon party dresses printed with tabloid headlines.</description>
