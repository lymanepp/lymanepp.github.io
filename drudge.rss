      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A reporter's dispatch from then-Hurricane Lane in Hawaii got a startling interruption when a tree fell on him mid-broadcast on Friday, according to the BBC.  James Cook was delivering an update on the storm's path when nature had other ideas.  "The latest forecast suggest the eye will skirt the Big Island in around 12 hours time before brushing past Maui on its way to O'ahu," Cook can be heard saying in the broadcast, when he is interrupted by a loud series of cracking and rustling noises.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's wall of secrecy - the work of a lifetime - is starting to crack. His longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty last week to breaking campaign-finance laws, and said he'd arranged hush money payments to two women at Trump's direction. Both a tabloid executive - who had served Trump by snuffing out damaging tales before they went public - and Trump's chief financial officer gave testimony in the case. All three had been part of the small circle of family, longtime aides and trusted associates who have long played crucial roles in Trump's strategy to shield the details of his personal life and business dealings from prying outsiders.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - At the outset of the 1998 impeachment hearings, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked a memorable question that could resonate for some lawmakers today: "Is this Watergate or Peyton Place?" "Peyton Place" was a steamy soap opera from the 1960s, based on a 1950s novel of the same name. The final judgment, based on the outcome of that impeachment process, was that President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky was much more a soap opera than something close to the Watergate scandal that drove President Richard Nixon from the Oval Office.</description>
