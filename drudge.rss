      <title>PELOSI: No wall money in border legislation...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/c2a379abd5fa4297943ac18d1491eef3</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump and congressional negotiations on border security (all times local): 1 p.m. Democrats are offering further details of their border security plan. They unveiled a measure Thursday that would not provide money for President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall and denying his request for additional border agents. The move ignores Trump's warnings that they'd be wasting their time if they don't come up with wall money. The Democratic measure, totaling almost $22 billion for U.S. Customs, the border patrol, and immigration agents, would significantly increase spending for scanners at ports of entry, humanitarian aid for apprehended migrants, and new aircraft to police the U.S.-Mexico border. It would also freeze the number of border patrol agents and block any wall construction in wildlife refuges along the border. I would provide for hiring 1,000 additional customs agents. Negotiators face a Feb. 15 deadline to avert another partial government shutdown.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temperatures dove more than 30 degrees below zero Thursday morning in the Midwest in this polar vortex outbreak's last gasp, driving wind chills to dangerous levels and clobbering long-standing records. After a bitter-cold morning with temperatures that sank all the way to minus-48 in northwest Minnesota, with wind chills down to minus-65, the air ostensibly "warmed" Wednesday afternoon, to readings such as minus-18 in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and minus-22 in Rockford, Illinois. But it didn't take long into the late afternoon for the mercury to plummet again to readings well below minus-20, minus-30 and in some locations in north-central Minnesota, minus-40 by Thursday morning.</description>

      <title>Military turning on Maduro?</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/820845/venezuela-opposition-leader-juan-guaid-discloses-clandestine-meetings-military</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a New York Times op-ed published late Wednesday, Venezuelan opposition leader and U.S.-backed interim president Juan GuaidÃ³ made his case that he, rather than President Nicolas Maduro, is the constitutionally legitimate leader of Venezuela. The opposition's plan to manage Maduro's "exit with the minimum of bloodshed," he wrote, is to shore up the opposition-led National Assembly, "consolidate the support of the international community," form "a transitional government," and hold "free elections." GuaidÃ³ added: The transition will require support from key military contingents. We have had clandestine meetings with members of the armed forces and the security forces. We have offered amnesty to all those who are found not guilty of crimes against humanity. The military's withdrawal of support from Mr. Maduro is crucial to enabling a change in government, and the majority of those in service agree that the country's recent travails are untenable. [Juan GuaidÃ³, The New York Times] GuaidÃ³ "did not say who in the military he had been speaking with or what their positions were," BBC News reports. "Venezuela's top military representative to the U.S., Col. JosÃ© Luis Silva, has defected â€” but senior military figures in Venezuela have supported Mr. Maduro," and many of them hold influential posts in his government. So far, the U.S. and more than 20 other nations have recognized GuaidÃ³ as interim president and the European Union says it will do so if Maduro doesn't announce new elections by Sunday, while Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey are among the countries that back Maduro. Maduro told Russia's RIA news agency that he is prepared to hold talks with the opposition "for the good of Venezuela," but GuaidÃ³ writes in the Times that while "Maduro and his henchmen disingenuously propose 'dialogue'" when repression fails, "we have become immune to such manipulation. There are no more stunts left for them to pull." Read the entire op-ed at The New York Times. Peter Weber</description>

      <title>'Mutant' coyotes with icy blue eyes in California...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/science/article/mutant-coyotes-blue-eyes-pt-reyes-photo-13574847.php </link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel Dietrich was driving around Point Reyes National Seashore one afternoon last year when he saw a flash of piercing blue. It was a coyote.  "I passed it, pulled my car over onto the shoulder of the road and waited," said Dietrich, the owner of Point Reyes Safaris, a wildlife and photography tour company.  The coyote eventually sauntered down the hillside to drink from the stream. When it lifted its head, Dietrich snapped a photo. It wasn't until he downloaded the images to his computer that he realized this coyote was distinct from the many he had seen in Point Reyes. It's eyes were a striking blue. Most coyotes have brown irises.  Following that afternoon in January 2018, Dietrich spotted a second blue-eyed coyote in Point Reyes, which he determined was distinct from the first because of an injury to its eye. National Geographic has since tracked down photographs of blue-eyed coyotes taken near Santa Cruz and Sacramento.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will unveil a plan Thursday to dramatically expand the federal estate tax on the wealthy, including a new 77 percent rate on billionaires' estates, as leading Democratic politicians push new taxes on the richest Americans to combat inequality. Sanders's bill, the "For the 99.8% Act," would tax the estates of the 0.2 percent of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million, while the rest of the country "would not see their taxes go up by one penny under this plan," according to aides to the Vermont senator, who is considering a 2020 presidential bid.</description>

      <link>https://www.apnews.com/c17d96857ebd4f7c9449b2eac8a7c27c</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new report estimates that nearly half of all U.S. adults have some form of heart or blood vessel disease, a medical milestone that's mostly due to recent guidelines that expanded how many people have high blood pressure. The American Heart Association says that more than 121 million adults had cardiovascular disease in 2016. Taking out those with only high blood pressure leaves 24 million, or 9 percent of adults, who have other forms of disease such as heart failure or clogged arteries. High blood pressure is now considered to be a reading above 130 over 80. It raises the risk for heart attacks, strokes and many other problems. Only about half of those with the condition have it under control.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — No televised roundtables with Cabinet secretaries. No freewheeling speeches from the Oval Office. No shouted comments on his way to Marine One. Where's the president? While the federal government is open once again, President Donald Trump has been largely behind closed doors. Republicans and Democrats alike seem just fine with Trump hanging back as legislators try to work out a deal to keep the government open and resolve a standoff over funding for the president's long-sought wall at the southern border. In fact, some lawmakers think less Trump might be a good thing, given his rocky relationships with legislators and open criticism of his negotiating abilities.</description>
