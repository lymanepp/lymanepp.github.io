      <title>Close call threatens to upend Trump's routine...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Close-call-at-CPAC-threatens-to-upend-Trump-s-15115615.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A growing sense of concern and uncertainty about the reach of the novel coronavirus has begun to take hold in the White House, after an attendee at a recent political conference where President Donald Trump spoke tested positive for covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.  Trump was photographed shaking hands with Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union who confirmed that he had been in direct contact with the infected man during the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.  The handshake at CPAC put Trump just two degrees of separation away from the virus that he has sought to minimize as it has rocked financial markets and tested his leadership skills. While the White House has maintained that Trump was never in direct contact with the infected person and is not suffering from any symptoms, the potential close call at a political event underscores how the outbreak threatens to upend the president's routine as he campaigns for reelection.  There is growing tension among Trump administration officials, who now see the rapidly spreading outbreak as an event that could consume the president's fourth year in office, even as Trump remains reluctant to see much cause for concern, according to White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal mood.  "I'm not concerned at all," Trump said Saturday when asked about the potential threat posed to the White House by the coronavirus.  He also pledged to keep holding "tremendous" political rallies, even as top public health officials within his government have called for millions of Americans to avoid large crowds and major events to reduce the risk of being infected.  White House officials have said they expect the outbreak to spread significantly throughout the country in the coming days,...</description>
