      <title>Tucker Carlson calls white supremacy 'hoax'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/857574/fox-news-tucker-carlson-claims-problem-white-supremacy-hoax</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Less than a week after a man believed to have written a racist manifesto about a "Hispanic invasion of Texas" killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, Fox News' Tucker Carlson claims the idea of America having a white supremacy problem is a "hoax." Carlson made this claim on his Tuesday show, saying that white supremacy is "right up there with Russia" in terms of problems the United States faces and is "actually not a real problem in America" at all. To back up this argument, Carlson said that every person who is a member of a white supremacist organization in the country could fit inside a single college football stadium. Of course, as CNN's Brian Stelter points out, this neglects the fact that "men like the suspect in El Paso aren't 'members' of an 'organization.'" "This is a hoax," Carlson claimed. "Just like the Russia hoax. It's a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power. That's exactly what's going on." Carlson's comments immediately drew backlash, with CNN's Don Lemon playing the clip on his show shortly after, taking a long pause and then asking his guest, "Was that not the dumbest thing you've ever heard"? Conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg also hit back against Carlson and hoped his argument isn't picked up by President Trump ahead of his El Paso visit. Goldberg wrote, "If Trump apes these talking points, it'll be awful for the country and devastating for Trump's presidency." Trump on Wednesday morning tweeted a different quote from Carlson's show, suggesting he saw the white supremacy segment.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;California's largest operator of recycling redemption centers shut down Monday and laid off 750 employees.  RePlanet closed all 284 of its centers, and company president David Lawrence said the decision was driven by increased business costs and falling prices of recycled aluminum and PET plastic, the San Jose Mercury News reported .  The move came three years after RePlanet closed 191 of its recycling centers and laid off 278 workers.  Now many San Francisco Bay Area residents have few or no options for redeeming their recyclables, which is especially concerning for those who live in poverty or experience homelessness and rely on recycling for income.  Consumer Watchdog, a nonprofit that studies issues in California's recycling industry, estimated that more than 40% of all redemption centers have closed in the last five years. The closures result in consumers only getting back about half of their nickel and dime bottle and can deposits, according to a recent report from the nonprofit.  The closures also mean that more bottles made of aluminum and polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, will end up in landfills. People will either throw their recyclables directly into the garbage, or place them in curbside recycling bins, which are often filled with contaminated material that must be discarded. China, which has bought much of the U.S.'s recyclable material, has become stricter about what kinds of material it will accept.  Advocates are urging the state to reform how it subsidizes recycling centers to account for rising operating costs in the wake of continuously low aluminum and plastic prices.</description>

      <title>POLL: 7 Dems don't have single supporter...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/857286/7-democrats-didnt-single-supporter-new-hampshire-primary-poll</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reality is knocking for these seven Democratic presidential candidates. The twenty-something strong 2020 primary field has been desperate for a weeding since it hit double-digit territory, though even candidates who didn't make a single debate stage have so far been reluctant to drop out. If they're looking for a reason to do so, this new Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll of likely New Hampshire primary voters might be the answer. Unsurprisingly, former Vice President Joe Biden retains his top spot in this New Hampshire poll, gathering 21.4% support. Next up is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with 16.8%, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) with 13.6%, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) at 8%. Yet down at the other end of the spectrum, seven Democrats didn't get a single survey respondent to declare they were their top primary choice: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio; former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel; Washington Gov. Jay Inslee; Miramir, Florida Mayor Wayne Messam; Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton; Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan; and former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak. Inslee, Moulton, and Ryan at least got a few people to say they were their second choice for president. Still, a solid 20.8% of respondents said they're undecided on their top 2020 primary pick so far, and another 15.7% are undecided on their second choice, giving these seemingly hopeless candidates a slim chance to turn things around. The Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll surveyed 500 likely Democratic New Hampshire primary voters from Aug. 1-4, and had a margin of error of 4.4%. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
