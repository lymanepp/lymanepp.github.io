      <title>Piglets become latest animals to file cases in court...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Germany-s-male-piglets-become-the-latest-animals-14845685.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Germany's Federal constitutional Court received a highly unusual complaint on Tuesday, with the country's entire population of male piglets named as plaintiffs.  The piglets probably have no idea, but they could be about to write legal history, animal rights lawyers hope, even as critics decry the suit as a PR stunt.  Amid a wave of efforts worldwide to allow animals to become plaintiffs, the current case is Germany's first such constitutional challenge. It was filed by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) group - whose representatives also act as plaintiffs - and alleges that the German government is infringing upon the animals' rights.  It is still unclear if the court will allow the case to proceed.  PETA argues that the castration of male piglets is violating German law, which states that animals shall not be harmed without reasonable explanation. The castration of young piglets without anesthesia was long considered exempt - but that exemption was withdrawn in 2013.  Castration without anesthesia is still in use, however, as the German government delayed the law from taking effect, following a transition period that was initially expected to last four years.  PETA alleges that in delaying the changes, the government is violating German law. It also alleges that even with anesthesia, the castrations will remain illegal, as they will not be completely pain-free, said Christian Arleth, a lawyer with PETA.  Besides seeking an end to the castration practice, PETA aims to get animals recognized as legal entities.  The legal status of animals has gradually expanded in Germany over the last decades, from their de facto perception as objects to their current status as organisms with rights protected by the Constitution. In parallel, the United States has seen a...</description>

      <title>Radio station disputes host's story of firing...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/A-radio-host-who-has-been-critical-of-Trump-says-14842799.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A conservative radio station in Colorado is disputing claims by one of its hosts that the station fired him mid-show last weekend just as he was airing disapproval of President Donald Trump. As host Craig Silverman and executives with the Denver-based 710 KNUS shared their views of events, the incident underscored the growing isolation of conservatives whose viewpoints reflect anything but unwavering support of Trump.  Silverman was not fired but was taken off air because of his decision to move forward with appearing on a competing station over management's objections, Salem Media Group General Manager and VP Brian Taylor said late Sunday - a statement Silverman said he interprets as KNUS backtracking to avoid violating a contract that requires 30 days' notice before termination.  "We have never told Mr. Silverman the position to take on Trump and impeachment," Taylor said in an email to The Washington Post. "Our hosts have the freedom to express their opinions on current events based on their own personal conviction. That goes for all of our hosts, including Mr. Silverman. Any suggestion to the contrary is simply untrue."  Despite Taylor's clarification, Silverman said Monday that his future with KNUS remains unclear.  "I'm not sure what I'll do. I'm still processing," Silverman told The Post. He said a key factor in his decision over whether to return to KNUS is if the station restores his show's archives to its site, including the Nov. 16 show in question. After Saturday's show, the station pulled the page for "The Craig Silverman Show," along with its podcast archive, from its website.  "Why not post the podcasts?" Silverman said. "[Listeners] would hear exactly what I was talking about when they cut the mic - I was talking about the connection between Roy Cohn, and...</description>

      <title>Health under scrutiny again...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Trump-s-health-under-scrutiny-again-after-14844719.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's impromptu weekend visit to a doctor remained shrouded in secrecy Monday, as he stayed away from the public eye and the White House dodged questions about his health.  Trump, 73, made an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda on Saturday, later saying on Twitter that he had begun "phase one" of his annual physical exam and that the results had been "very good."  It is unusual for a president to do a physical exam in multiple stages months apart, and the circumstances surrounding Trump's visit renewed questions about the status of his health and the White House's handling of his medical information, according to several experts.  The White House would not say Monday if Trump planned to release records from his visit or describe which tests he took.  In a statement on Saturday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump had undergone a "quick exam and labs" and that he "remains healthy and energetic without complaints." Grisham also said Trump had taken advantage of a "free weekend" in Washington to "begin portions of his routine annual physical exam."  The White House did not respond to requests for more information Monday.  Two people who interacted with Trump late last week said he seemed to be hoarse and have signs of a cold, but nothing serious seemed amiss.  Trump's voice was occasionally subdued and raspy during a news conference Wednesday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But Trump, 73, also spoke for more than an hour Thursday at a political rally, the latest in a string of campaign events that the White House has pointed to as signs of his energy and vigor.  On Monday, he remained out of public view, holding his meetings behind closed doors. He met with Federal Reserve...</description>

      <title>IRS whistleblower case advances...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/IRS-whistleblower-case-advances-as-Senate-staff-14843718.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Two Senators are probing a whistleblower's allegations that at least one political appointee at the Treasury Department may have tried to interfere with the audit of President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, a sign that lawmakers are moving to investigate the complaint lodged by a senior staffer at the Internal Revenue Service.  Staff for Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate finance committee, met with the IRS whistleblower earlier this month, those people said. Follow-up interviews are being scheduled to further explore the whistleblower's allegations.  It could not be learned to what extent the senators view the whistleblower as a credible source. Trump administration officials have previously downplayed the complaint's significance and suggested it is politically motivated.  The whistleblower, a career IRS official, initially filed a complaint in July, reporting that he was told at least one Treasury political appointee attempted to improperly interfere with the annual audit of the president's or vice president's tax returns. In recent weeks, the whistleblower filed additional documentation related to the original complaint, which was given to congressional officials in July, the two people said. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the complaint, which pertains to a confidential IRS audit that cannot be disclosed under federal law.  The contents of the additional information provided by the whistleblower were not known.  The IRS whistleblower complaint was first disclosed in an August court filing by Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. It raises the prospect that Trump administration officials at...</description>
