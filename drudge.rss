      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armed with a crowbar, a man in a black tank top approached Joslyn Allen on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles just after 2 a.m. on Monday, spewing hateful slurs. "He literally grabs my hand and pulls me," Allen, who is a transgender woman, told KABC. "He's like 'We're going to find your friends because I'm going to beat y'all up.' "  Allen got away. But the man soon found her friends, Jaslene Busanet and Eden Estrada, who has a large following on YouTube as Eden the Doll. He hurled hate speech at the women, who are also transgender, and hit Busanet over the head with a bottle, knocking her to the ground, according to police.  All the while, a crowd of onlookers stood by, watching and recording the repeated verbal and physical assaults, with many yelling their own transphobic insults at the women.  The Los Angeles Police Department said on Thursday that they had found the man responsible for the crime, which inspired dozens to march in support of the victims and led city officials this week to slam the bystanders for failing to help the women.  Police arrested 29-year-old Carlton Callway on robbery and assault charges, calling Callway's actions a hate crime. Authorities said in a news conference Thursday that the suspect bragged about the assault on social media. Police also identified two other men allegedly involved in the incident, charging Willie Walker, 42, with extortion. Police are still searching for a third suspect, Davion Williams, 22, who is wanted for assault.  In a news conference on Thursday, deputy chief Justin Eisenberg called the witnesses to the scene "callous" and Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch O'Farrell said he was outraged by the footage.  "When I saw the video, like anyone who has seen it who believes in human decency, to see this level of violence celebrated gleefully, so much so that the...</description>

      <title>Selling something that disappeared: Optimism...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/932712/biden-selling-something-that-disappeared-from-american-politics-optimism</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In accepting the Democratic Partys presidential nomination on Thursday night, former Vice President Joe Biden offered the country something that has been missing from our politics lately: optimism. Yes, Biden referred to the present era as a 'season of darkness,' and made a pointed, even angry critique of how President Donald Trump has handled the COVID-19 pandemic. But he also made the case that â€” in this deeply polarized moment â€” Americans can and will work together for the common good, and that great possibilities are still attainable. 'The defining feature of America, everything is possible,' he said, later adding: 'This is our moment to make hope and history rhyme.' Now, optimistic talk about America's possibilities has often been a staple of American political talk. Barack Obama famously rode to the White House on a wave of 'hope and change.' But even Obama seems to have lost some of his hope â€” on Wednesday night, he warned the nation of President Trump's threat to American democracy, and concluded his speech with a plaintive 'Stay safe.' Obama's dark mood seemed to match that of the electorate: Three quarters of Americans think the country is on the wrong track, including 63 percent of Republicans. Much of that negativity has surely been earned. But the dark outlook has probably been helped along by President Trump's divide-and-conquer approach to politics. To the extent that Trump offers optimism to America, it almost always centers on himself: 'I alone can fix it.' And that optimism, such as it is, is often misplaced. Think of all the times Trump has suggested the coronavirus will simply 'disappear.' Biden, meanwhile, seemed more realistic about the challenges facing the country. And he centered his optimism on Americans and their ability â€” even now â€” to unite with each other. 'America isn't just a collection of clashing interests of Red States or Blue States,' he said. 'We're so much bigger than that. We're so much better than that.' Optimism, once a familiar force in our politics, now feels strange. We're about to find out if Americans still buy a hopeful message.

      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Can-you-get-coronavirus-via-secondhand-smoke-The-15504536.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The primary way the novel coronavirus spreads, according to health experts, is through close contact with people who are infected. Being in proximity with someone who has the coronavirus exposes you to the respiratory droplets emitted when the person coughs, sneezes or even speaks.  What if you're close enough to smell someone's secondhand smoke, or pass through a cloud of smoke on your way into a store? Does that expose you to the coronavirus, if the smoker happens to be infected?  There is little evidence to suggest the smoke itself could be carrying the coronavirus, but researchers and physicians say that merely being able to smell someone's cigarette is a warning sign you're breathing air that was just in someone else's lungs.  William Ristenpart, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of California at Davis who researches how pathogens are transported, told The Washington Post that the smoke particles themselves are unlikely to be carrying a virus that could infect other people. This is partly because the heat from the cigarette would probably kill the virus, but also because "a large fraction of the smoke particulates go into your lungs, never hit anything, and then are exhaled," Ristenpart said.  But there is reason to be concerned about transmission if you get a whiff of someone's smoke - the respiratory particles that come along with it.  "If you smell somebody else's exhaled cigarette smoke, then you are inhaling air that was in that person's lungs," Ristenpart said. "This means you could also be inhaling their virus-laden respiratory particles, which are composed of respiratory mucosa rather than ash."  Research is still inconclusive on whether the coronavirus can be transmitted in airborne particles, but the hypothesis is gaining traction. While the main source of transmission is believed to be...</description>

      <title>Navalny aide says doctors blocking transfer to cover up poisoning...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Navalny-aide-says-doctors-are-blocking-transfer-15504353.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOSCOW - Doctors at the Siberian hospital where Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is in a coma after a suspected poisoning denied his family's request to send him to Europe for treatment, though they said Friday his condition had improved.  With Navalny's plight already a rallying point for Russian opposition groups and others who allege the prominent Kremlin critic was deliberately poisoned by President Vladimir Putin's regime, the decision to block him from obtaining treatment abroad fueled anger over perceived interference from Moscow.  Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, accused doctors of endangering his life, suggesting on Twitter that doctors wanted to hinder an investigation by stalling "until the poison in his body can no longer be traced."  "The ban on transporting Navalny is an attempt on his life, which is now being carried out by the doctors and the deceitful authorities who sanctioned it," she said.  Alexander Murakhovsky, the chief physician for the Omsk Emergency Hospital No. 1, said Navalny was not well enough to be moved.  "His condition has somewhat improved as of 8 a.m. But, nonetheless, we have been unable thus far to fully stabilize him," he told reporters, adding that doctors have "five working diagnoses" but that he could not offer details.  Meanwhile, Ivan Zhdanov, an associate of Navalny's, said Friday that transportation police told him they discovered poison they deemed dangerous not only for Navalny but for those around him - so much so that access to Navalny will not be permitted without a full hazmat suit. Zhdanov said the authorities did not disclose details of the poison, citing an active investigation.  But that conflicts with what Anatoly Kalinichenko, the deputy chief physician at the Omsk hospital, told reporters two hours later....</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden's presidential nomination acceptance speech is being hailed as a career best, even by his critics. And perhaps no praise was more surprising on Thursday night than that being directed at him on Fox News. Anchor Chris Wallace, who previously panned Kamala Harris' vice presidential nomination speech, called Biden's big moment 'enormously effective.' 'Remember, Donald Trump has been talking for months about Joe Biden as mentally shot,' Wallace went on. He added, 'I thought that he blew a hole â€” a big hole â€” in that characterization. â€¦ Trump is gonna have to run against a candidate, not a caricature.' Commentator Brit Hume also praised Biden's speech, calling it 'very good' and 'delivered with force and clarity.' His colleague, Dana Perino shared the view, saying Biden 'just hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth â€¦ He had pace, rhythm, energy, emotion, and delivery. I think if he looks back, he's got to say that was probably the best speech of his life.' Karl Rove added that Biden's speech was an 'excellent end' to the convention, calling the former VP's remarks 'very good.' Watch more of Fox News' surprisingly favorable coverage below.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden gave the biggest speech of his career on Thursday night when he accepted the Democratic nomination for president. 'The current president's cloaked America in darkness for far too long,' the former vice president said. 'Too much anger, too much fear, too much division. I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. â€¦ And make no mistake, united we can and will overcome this season of darkness.' The speech earned rave reviews, with former President Barack Obama's chief speechwriter Cody Keenan calling it 'easily Joe Biden's best speech. He rose to the moment in a big way.' Added Politico's chief political correspondent Tim Alberta, 'We're watching an old ballplayer whose skills have diminished turn in a career-best performance in the biggest game of his life. Remarkable to witness.' The speech even received praise by some across the aisle. Conservative commentator Erick Erickson tweeted, 'Biden exceeded expectations. That was a fine speech.' Rich Lowry, editor of the National Review, agreed, tweeting: 'Forceful, energetic delivery, strongest when portraying his program as all about jobs, speech lost focus in the second half â€” but overall, probably helped himself.' Guy Benson, the political editor of Townhall, said simply: 'Biden crushed expectations.' Even those who've known Biden for years were in awe. 'After Biden mopped the floor with Paul Ryan in 2012 VP debate, I looked at him and said 'you will never have a better performance than tonight,'' tweeted Jim Messina, Obama's 2012 campaign manager. 'I was wrong. Tonight is better.' Jeva Lange</description>
