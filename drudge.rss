      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/At-rally-Biden-pledges-to-unite-the-country-13856573.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHILADELPHIA - Former vice president Joe Biden offered himself to voters as a leader uniquely positioned to unify a divided country during a rally Saturday afternoon. The event, the largest of his nascent campaign, was intended to bookend the opening phase of his White House bid.  "We're all in this together," Biden told the crowd. "We need to remember that today, I think, more than any time in my career."  He added a note of optimism: "In this great experiment of equality and opportunity and decency, we haven't lived up - but we've never given up on it."  Biden walked onstage with his signature swagger, wearing a pair of aviator sunglasses that he shed, along with a sport coat, before speaking to an audience of about 6,000, according to an estimate from a security firm hired by the campaign.  Biden took repeated and direct aim at President Donald Trump, comparing his tactics to those used by dictators. At one point, he quoted Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, delivered during the Civil War on a Pennsylvania battlefield, to drive home the importance of uniting the country.  "Will we be the ones to let the government of, by, and for the people perish from the face of the earth?" Biden asked. "Dare we let that happen? Dare we let that happen? Absolutely not. We will not."  Biden entered the race three weeks ago with a video that spotlighted Trump's reaction to the violent 2017 "United the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists marched and clashed with protesters.  The president said at the time there were "very fine people on both sides" of the conflict, which prompted Biden to pen an opinion piece in the Atlantic titled "We Are Living Through a Battle for the Soul of This Nation." The former vice president has made restoring the nation's soul...</description>

      <title>BALZ:  Do Obama, Trump signal shift in future of presidency? </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Do-Obama-Trump-signal-shift-in-future-of-13856548.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more than two centuries, until the election of 2008, American presidents all looked alike. They were white and male and every one of them came to office with experience in the government, military or both. Barack Obama, the first African-American president, broke one mold. Donald Trump, who had neither military nor government experience, broke the other.  In their own ways, Obama and Trump were two of the most unlikely people ever elected to the presidency, raising the question of whether voters in America are using a new lens through which to judge the qualities and qualifications of presidential aspirants. Trump's presidency continues that experiment, as does the competition among the candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to oppose him in 2020.  Bob Tyson is a retired database consultant who lives in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He is a Trump supporter and says the president has helped change his thinking about the qualities needed for someone to hold the nation's highest office.  "Having that celebrity personality and projecting an image in the media is more important than traditional qualifications," he said. "It's made me think differently about what it takes to be elected president. The traditional path of being a state governor or U.S. senator doesn't seem to count as much. It's being able to manage your image in the media and galvanizing your base."  Will and Wendy Keen were in the audience at the Big Grove Brewery and Taproom in Iowa City a few weeks ago, awaiting the arrival of former vice president Joe Biden. They have been making what Will called "a diligent effort to connect with each of the candidates" campaigning in their state.  One person who has caught their eye is South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a candidate who, at age 37 and the leader of a relatively small city, might not have...</description>
