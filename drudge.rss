      <title>FAKE TRENDING:  PRO-TRUMP GROUP PAYS TEENS TO POST ONLINE</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Pro-Trump-group-pays-teens-to-post-online-15569883.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - One tweet claimed coronavirus numbers were intentionally inflated, adding, "It's hard to know what to believe." Another warned, "Don't trust Dr. Fauci."  A Facebook comment argued that mail-in ballots "will lead to fraud for this election," while an Instagram comment amplified the erroneous claim that 28 million ballots went missing in the past four elections.  The messages have been emanating in recent months from the accounts of young people in Arizona seemingly expressing their own views - standing up for President Donald Trump in a battleground state and echoing talking points from his reelection campaign.  Far from representing a genuine social media groundswell, however, the posts are the product of a sprawling yet secretive campaign that experts say evades the guardrails put in place by social media companies to limit online disinformation of the sort used by Russia during the 2016 campaign.  Teenagers, some of them minors, are being paid to pump out the messages at the direction of Turning Point Action, an affiliate of Turning Point USA, a prominent conservative youth organization based in Phoenix, according to four people with independent knowledge of the effort. Their descriptions were confirmed by detailed notes from relatives of one of the teenagers who recorded conversations with him about the efforts.  The campaign draws on the spam-like behavior of bots and trolls, with the same or similar language posted repeatedly across social media. But it is carried out, at least in part, by humans paid to use their own accounts, though nowhere disclosing their relationship with Turning Point Action or the digital firm brought in to oversee the day-to-day activity. One user included a link to Turning Point USA's website in his Twitter profile until The Washington Post began asking questions about the...</description>

      <title>MAGA rallies getting less coverage on TV news...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/entertainment/article/Trump-s-rallies-getting-less-coverage-on-TV-news-15566635.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's campaign rallies are getting less attention on television this election cycle. Particularly when they're held indoors, during a global pandemic, like his campaign stop in Henderson, Nev., on Sunday night.  Compared with coverage of his rallies during the 2016 election cycle, the major broadcast and cable news networks have been less likely to go live with the president on the stump.  The one holdout typically has been Fox News though the president's favorite channel lately has been prone to cut in and out through parts of the speech that meander or conflict with its high-rated prime-time pundits.  But when the president spoke at the Xtreme Manufacturing facility Sunday, Fox did not broadcast the rally. None of the major networks did. Not even C-SPAN, which historically broadcasts his rallies as something of a public service for viewers.  For health reasons, correspondents and camera crews for the leading broadcast and cable news networks mostly reported from outside the facility. The indoor rally was held in violation of state's coronavirus regulations, drawing the ire of Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, who called it "shameful, dangerous and irresponsible."  It was the campaign's first indoor rally since it held an event in Tulsa, Okla., in June. Former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain appeared at that rally without wearing a mask, was hospitalized several days later and eventually died of covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus; a local reporter who covered the rally, Paul Monies of Oklahoma Watch, said he later tested positive for the coronavirus and was asymptomatic.  Representatives for NBC News and CBS News, which kept their correspondents outside, told The Washington Post on Monday that their networks follow public health...</description>

      <title>TRUMP WANTS WEEKLY FOX SHOW</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/937587/trump-says-hell-fox--friends-every-week--but-host-steve-doocy-doesnt-agree-have</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump is apparently under the impression he has a standing weekly date with the hosts of Fox &amp; Friends — but they might not be on board. Trump on Tuesday appeared on Fox &amp; Friends for another lengthy phone interview, and at the top of the conversation, he informed viewers that this would be a weekly occurrence going forward. 'We've agreed to do it once a week in the morning, and I look forward to it,' Trump said. But it's unclear who the 'we' in that sentence was considering host Steve Doocy expressed surprise at this news, responding, 'I haven't heard that.' Later, after a conversation that lasted nearly 50 minutes, Trump reiterated that viewers should tune in next Monday for more. But this time, Doocy made clear that this arrangement has not been agreed upon by Fox News at all. 'You may want to do it every week, but Fox is not committed to that,' Doocy told Trump. 'We're going to take it on a case by case basis.' Doocy's co-host Brian Kilmeade looked completely bewildered as he made this declaration on the air, possibly as he processed the fact that the network might soon have to start ghosting the president of the United States. Brendan Morrow Donald Trump: 'We're gonna [call into Fox &amp; Friends] every week. Every Monday I think they said.' Brian Kilmeade: 'Sounds good.'

      <title>Prominent Southern Baptists dropping 'Southern' name amid racial unrest...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Prominent-Southern-Baptists-are-dropping-15567758.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention are increasingly dropping the "Southern" part of their Baptist name, calling it a potentially painful reminder of the convention's historic role in support of slavery.  The 50,000 Baptist churches in the convention are autonomous and can still choose to refer to themselves as "Southern Baptist" or "SBC." But in his first interview on the topic, convention president J.D. Greear said momentum has been building to adopt the name "Great Commission Baptists," both because of the racial reckoning underway in the United States and because many have long seen the "Southern Baptist" name as too regional for a global group of believers.  "Our Lord Jesus was not a White Southerner but a brown-skinned Middle Eastern refugee," said Greear, who this summer used the phrase "Black lives matter" in a presidential address and announced that he would retire a historic gavel named for an enslaver. "Every week we gather to worship a savior who died for the whole world, not one part of it. What we call ourselves should make that clear."  The shift takes place at the end of a summer of racial unrest, when Confederate monuments have been removed, schools have been renamed and Washington D.C. has decided to change the name of its football team. For Southern Baptists, the change also reflects a long-standing desire to remove confusion when the convention launches churches in the Northern United States and overseas.  The convention formed in 1845, splitting from Northern Baptists over Southern support for missionaries who owned enslaved people, and is considered the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, with 14.5 million members. It will continue to legally operate as the SBC, officials said, citing the hefty cost and complexity of a legal name change. But since August, the denomination's...</description>
