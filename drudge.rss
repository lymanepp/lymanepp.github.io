      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/How-the-Internet-lost-its-soul-14775213.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week, we celebrate what many consider the 50th birthday of the Internet. The underpinnings of the World Wide Web originated in an American communications network built for national defense and the pursuit of knowledge: ARPANET. Funded by the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency, the network was designed so that scientists could share computer hardware, software and data.  It worked. In the ensuing decades, the ARPANET, and after the 1980s, the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET), did indeed allow scientists to collaboratively build knowledge around networked tools and information. But expanding access to the Internet, combined with looser government regulations, ultimately produced a situation no one foresaw or intended. On today's Internet, conspiracy theories run rampant, identities can be faked and our real-life elections are vulnerable to manipulation. A network designed for spreading truth became a profit-driven industry, a public sphere that threatens to undermine the public good.  The original ARPANET was designed for a relatively small community of people united by a technical challenge. At the time, computers from different manufacturers ran incompatible software, and long-distance data communications links were costly and unreliable. Networks connected only a few identical computers within a small region.  But ARPANET had an audacious proposal: It would span the continental United States to connect 15 research sites encompassing a diverse array of computers.  "Almost every conceivable item of computer hardware and software will be in the network," project leader Larry Roberts pointed out. "This is the greatest challenge of the system, as well as its greatest ultimate value." As a leading funder of computer science research, ARPA was able to mobilize a talented group of faculty...</description>

      <title>The Trump administration's obsession with ancient Persian emperor...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/The-Trump-administration-s-obsession-with-an-14756082.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump and his lieutenants have a penchant for Middle Eastern monarchs. In close to three years in power, the administration has courted or hosted virtually all the region's unelected potentates, yoking its anti-Iranian agenda in part to the concerns of a clutch of Arab sheikhs and princes. But looming above them all is a royal ghost from the past.  On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo commemorated a moment more than 2,500 years ago. "Today in 539 BC, Cyrus the Great entered Babylon and freed the Jewish people from captivity," Pompeo tweeted. "His respect for human rights and religious freedom inspired America's founding fathers. The U.S. stands with the Iranian people, who are blocked by the regime from celebrating his legacy."  Pompeo was referring to a rather famous event in history. According to sources including biblical scripture, Cyrus allowed the Judeans deported and exiled following the ravages of Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II to return to their homeland. His conquest of Babylon cemented his dominion over much of the lands we now consider to be the Middle East, an empire that stretched from the Indus River basin to the Mediterranean Sea. Like any other ancient warrior king, he presided over massacres and pillage, including a notorious incident immortalized by the ancient Greek chronicler Herodotus where Cyrus burned a vanquished foe and 14 young boys alive on a funeral pyre.  But Cyrus is memorialized by Iranians (and non-Iranians) as a unifying proto-national hero, an all-powerful emperor who still allowed for toleration and coexistence among different peoples, sects and religions. The Cyrus Cylinder, a barrel-shaped tablet etched in Babylonian cuneiform that was unearthed by archaeologists in the late 19th century, announced his victory and his desire to let his new subjects retain...</description>

      <title>Same-sex love scene was cut from movie on DELTA flights. So was word 'lesbian'...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/A-same-sex-love-scene-was-cut-from-a-movie-on-14637534.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Near the end of the 2019 film "Booksmart," a tense bathroom kiss between Amy, the film's timid, justice-minded lead, and Hope, her high school's "basic hot girl," turns into more: Hidden from a house party outside, they engage in a hookup that's been hailed as an unusually frank, on-screen portrayal of sex between two women.  But watch "Booksmart" on a Delta Air Lines flight, and the R-rated high school comedy will skip right through that scene. Reportedly, the in-flight cut also passes over the words "vagina" and "genitals," an exchange about a lesbian sex act, talk of a urinary tract infection, and a bit in which Amy and her friend watch porn in the back of a ride-share.  Amid calls of censorship, those edits - made by an outside company that works with the airline - are drawing the ire and confusion of passengers and Hollywood insiders alike, in what's at least the fourth instance when same-sex romance has been stripped from an in-flight Delta movie in recent years.  "If it's not X-rated, surely it's acceptable on an airplane," director Olivia Wilde said at an awards show on Sunday night. "There's insane violence of bodies being smashed in half [in other movies], and yet a love scene between two women is censored from the film. It's such an integral part of this character's journey. I don't understand it."  In a statement to The Washington Post early on Thursday, Delta said its "content parameters do not in any way ask for the removal of homosexual content from the film."  But it's not the first time the airline has come under fire for the situation - or, for that matter, even the only time this week. On Tuesday, other Delta passengers protested that the in-flight cut of "Rocketman," the Elton John biopic released this year, was missing sex scenes and even a chaste kiss between two men.  The same was true of "Carol,"...</description>
