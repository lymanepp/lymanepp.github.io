      <title>Metal that costs 15 times more than gold driving surge in thefts of catalytic converters...</title>
      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/business/article/A-precious-metal-that-costs-15-times-more-than-15999562.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In just the past week, Andrew Reichenbach's car repair shop in Minneapolis has had three Mitsubishis come in with their exhaust pipes sawed off. The thieves were after a precious metal - tucked into almost all American vehicles - in such demand that it costs 15 times the price of gold.  "We've had 60 or 70 in just our shop alone if that gives you a sense of the magnitude of these thefts," the mechanic said. "Most of my customers are just baffled. Like, why would somebody do this?"  The metallic element is housed in a bulbous piece of aluminum, called a catalytic converter, that encases a honeycomb structure that filters fumes. National data is scarce, but news reports point to thousands of catalytic converter thefts over the past year, a crime wave that has risen with the price of one of their essential components: rhodium, a silvery-white chemical element that is a byproduct of the production of platinum and palladium, and is unparalleled in its ability to remove the most toxic pollutants from vehicle exhaust.  A single troy ounce, which is slightly heavier than a regular ounce, of rhodium cost around $27,000 last week - more than a brand new Toyota Prius. That's up from $1,700 three years ago.  But to understand why those prices, and thefts, are skyrocketing, and to understand how long they might stay that high, we must go back more than a decade to the 2008 global recession and follow its effects until they coincide with last year's pandemic-driven economic catastrophe in South Africa, where 80% of the world's rhodium originates.  Before the 2008 recession hit, South African mines were churning out platinum, a pillar of the country's export economy that is used in a wide variety of products from jewelry to heavy industry. They kept doing so during the downturn, creating a massive surplus of platinum that persists to...</description>

      <title>Historic drought deepens in West...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Historic-drought-deepens-in-the-West-as-window-15997705.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year 2020 is going to be remembered for a lot of things, many of them not so good. Included in the not-so-good list is the drought that has plagued the West, lasting into 2021. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which has published weekly maps on drought since 2000, the 2020 drought is the worst, in terms of its geographical scope, in over 20 years.  Almost 80% of the Western U.S. is in drought, with nearly 42% of the region in "extreme" or "exceptional" drought.  Much of the region saw developing drought in the summer, following a warm and dry spring. Since then, conditions have deteriorated, and the precipitation deficits continue to build. At its maximum extent in January 2021, 47% of the west was in extreme drought or worse. Nearly a quarter of the area was in the worst drought category, an event with a probability frequency of only once every 50 to 100 years.  February did bring an active weather pattern with it, however. The Pacific Northwest received more than 10 inches of precipitation last month. Much of the interior Rockies through Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado received between 1 and 5 inches of moisture for the month. The Sierra Nevada in California also received between 2 and 6 inches, much of that in the form of snow.  However, despite the precipitation, some areas are still struggling. Blue outlines in the map below show where snowpack improved last month. The Southwest was much drier in February.  Where the purple outlines overlap on this map, these areas are above average for snowpack now. Outside of the purple outlines, snowpack is still largely below average. Areas outlined in orange experienced a decline in the percentage of average snowpack since the beginning of February.  And red outlines the areas where snowpack is extremely low, compared to normal. The evidence is clear -...</description>

      <title>Inflation Expectations Hit Decade High...</title>
      <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-yields-resurgent-inflation-expectations-171038508.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Bloomberg) -- U.S. Treasuries tumbled anew on Wednesday, driving long-maturity yields to their highest levels this week and pushing up inflation expectations as traders continued to price in a quicker economic rebound from the pandemic.Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields surged as much as 10.3 basis points to 1.495%, a move reminiscent of last Thursday’s startling selloff in government debt. Meanwhile, a market proxy for the anticipated annual inflation rate for the next half-decade exceeded 2.5% for the first time since 2008 -- aided by climbing oil prices. At least part of the trigger for the fixed-income losses came from the U.K., which said it will sell more bonds than expected as its economy emerges from a deep recession.Also in the background was Joe Biden’s announcement that enough doses of virus vaccine should be available to every American adult by the end of May, and a report Wednesday that the president would moderate certain stimulus demands to try to win support for his virus-relief bill. Rising yields have started to draw the attention of Federal Reserve officials, leaving all eyes on an appearance Thursday by Chair Jerome Powell.Among other things, “the stimulus package is likely to go through and the economy is reopening,” said Michael Franzese, managing partner at MCAP LLC in New York. “The battle is on between rates going higher super-fast and a Federal Reserve that’s trying to keep the market stable and may try to slow the momentum of the reflation and economic-rebound trade into something more manageable.”Early inklings of inflation were evident in data from the Institute for Supply Management this week: Measures of prices paid jumped to their highest levels since 2008.A large trade on Wednesday in 10-year Treasury options and accompanying futures selling also fueled the leap in yields, as did heavy corporate bond supply.The rates market is not yet done fully pricing in robust U.S. economic growth, which would entail a 10-year yield trading around 1.90%, said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer of Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania. That’s the level last seen in January 2020, two months before pandemic fears started prompting forced shutdowns in the U.S.Beyond rising nominal and breakeven rates, “the dynamic rise in the 10-year real, inflation-adjusted yield we’ve seen is the market partly adjusting to a faster-than-anticipated pace of rate normalization by the Fed,” he said.The timing of the Fed’s first rate hike, known as liftoff, and subsequent rate hikes haven’t been factored in, making Treasuries vulnerable to a further selloff in the weeks ahead, according to Heppenstall.(Adds reference to Fed rate hikes in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</description>
