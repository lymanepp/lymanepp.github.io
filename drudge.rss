      <title>Promised drive-through testing sites haven't materialized...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Promised-drive-through-testing-sites-haven-t-15162863.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two weeks ago, President Donald Trump promised a network of drive-through covid-19 testing sites across the country where people could be tested "very safely, quickly and conveniently." In a Rose Garden news conference, chief executives of Target, Walgreens, Walmart and CVS said they would work with the government to provide space in store parking lots.  While the four retailers have a combined 26,400 U.S. stores, this vision of a proliferation of coronavirus testing sites has yet to materialize. Walgreens and CVS have opened one site each, while Walmart last weekend opened two drive-through testing locations near Chicago. Target hasn't opened any. Rite Aid, which joined the effort later, has opened one drive-through facility in Philadelphia.  Like much of the nation's coronavirus response, the burden of organizing and operating these testing sites has fallen to state and local governments. On occasion, they've enlisted the help of private industry. But an array of logistical challenges, ranging from a shortage of testing supplies to funding, has meant only a small fraction of Americans can get diagnosed for covid-19 in a way that is routine in South Korea and elsewhere.  "We have to change how we are approaching this, or we will just hope that people will stay isolated or pay attention, said Garrett Contreras, the fire chief in the Bay Area city of Hayward, who managed to launch a testing site Monday after he personally appealed to scores of pharmaceutical companies to provide equipment. "I mean, how did some knucklehead fire chief from Hayward find a lab? It's just wrong."  A senior administration official, speaking anonymously to share internal deliberations, said the administration's initial drive-through testing ambitions had to be scaled back because of the lack of tests nationwide. Another initial challenge was...</description>

      <title>Demand for online ordering leaves grocery stores scrambling, customers waiting...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Demand-for-online-ordering-leaves-grocery-stores-15162349.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;James Govan is not taking any chances with the novel coronavirus.  A retired federal employee who lives in Arlington, Virginia, he's 83 and has a heart condition. He doesn't go outside for food and hasn't left the house for two weeks.  When Govan tried to order groceries online from Safeway, he found the store's system would let him fill his virtual cart but wouldn't let him schedule a delivery. All the slots were taken for several days, and a calendar for later dates wasn't available.  Govan won't starve. He has friends and a son who can help, although he said he doesn't "feel like imposing." The shopping experience worried him: If grocery stores can't make timely deliveries, seniors will need to shop in person or rely on a network of friends and family members, which some don't have.  "I took an hour diddling with this online shopping business - it's kind of new to me," Govan said. "I guess they're just having a stress of staff power."  Govan stumbled on a hiccup in the food supply chain affecting grocery stores across the nation as the number of coronavirus cases surges and people avoid public places. Stores are struggling to hire more workers to fill and deliver additional online orders.  Andrew Whelan, a spokesman for Albertsons, Safeway's parent company, said the grocery giant plans to hire 30,000 workers and is partnering with companies in the service industry, such as Hilton and MGM Resorts, that have laid off workers to find them. Whelan said the new hires will boost the timeliness of online deliveries.  "As you can imagine, we are experiencing high demand. We appreciate our customers' patience on this," he said. "Certainly, as you know, these are unprecedented times."  Other companies are making similar moves. Instacart is planning to hire 300,000 personal...</description>

      <title>Florida Keys closed to visitors... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Florida-Keys-which-welcomes-all-to-come-as-you-15162424.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The Overseas Highway into the Florida Keys was blocked off to visitors Friday, an acknowledgment that tourism - the lifeblood of the islands - will have to be temporarily sacrificed as part of the effort to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.  The move follows a crescendo of actions from local officials, who a week ago ordered tourists to leave and all hotels and short-term rentals to close, and comes as part of a broader attempt across the Sunshine State at a time when spring breakers are usually descending.  Monroe County has had 14 reported cases of coronavirus infection and no deaths, but residents said they've noticed more and more people coming to the Keys recently from Miami-Dade County, which has the most cases in the state, at 744.  "It breaks my heart," said Elizabeth Moscynski, president of the Key Largo Chamber of Commerce. "It's so tough, because we're such a friendly place. Now we have to tell people they can't come down."  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced at a news briefing Friday that he would be expanding restrictions on travelers and tourists entering the state from areas of the country hardest hit by the virus.  He said he was adding Louisiana to an earlier executive order that requires air travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to self-isolate for two weeks upon arrival. Travelers from nearby Louisiana, which is also experiencing an outbreak, will now be required to isolate as well, including those traveling by car.  Since his earlier order, 3,400 travelers from the New York area have been screened in Florida, and there has been a "dramatic reduction in air traffic," DeSantis said.  The governor also announced a two-week ban on new vacation rentals, though it was not immediately clear how state officials...</description>

      <title>Not since Black Plague have Jerusalem's holy alleys fallen so still...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Not-since-the-Black-Plague-have-Jerusalem-s-holy-15162438.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;JERUSALEM - Adeeb Joudeh, standing in front of the now-locked Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem's Old City, had a pretty specific answer when asked when the church last closed to the public like this:  "It was the year 1349, at the time of the Black Plague," he said, holding the key that had shut things down a day earlier and back in the 14th century as well.  They measure time differently here in the oldest section of one of the world's oldest cities, the ancient, dispute-riddled and spiritually dense center of three major religions. Yet it takes an eternity to recall the last time Christians, Jews and Muslims, each claiming various overlapping quarters of the Old City, were kept from their eternal rounds.  But coronavirus, like the medieval pandemic before it, has all but silenced this bustling Holy Land hot spot. The walls built by King Herod, the Crusaders and others (aided by the flashing lights of police cars at the gates) keep out the throngs of tourists and pilgrims who would normally teem through this UNESCO World Heritage site, especially in the weeks before Passover, Easter and Ramadan.  The steep, narrow lanes are empty but for police patrols and the relatively few residents who live in the Old City full time. Worship sites of all kinds are closed, most notably the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, built on the site where Jesus is said to have been buried and resurrected; the Western Wall, the most sacred place of prayer for Jews; and al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam.  Here, for the guardians of all that is sacred, the stillness feels like a necessary evil.  "To see the holy church closed is very, very, very sad for me," said Joudeh, one day after getting orders from Israeli health officials to swing the big doors shut indefinitely. "All the...</description>

      <title>Mnuchin 'one of most powerful Cabinet members in modern history'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/905240/coronavirus-stimulus-make-mnuchin-most-powerful-cabinet-members-modern-history</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will gain some unprecedented power from the coronavirus relief bill he helped write. The House is set to pass a stimulus bill that addresses economic shortfalls caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on Friday (or possibly Saturday). It'll send individual checks to Americans and billions of dollars to institutions and businesses, and with Mnuchin overseeing it all, it'll make him 'one of the most powerful Cabinet members in modern history,' The Washington Post writes. Mnuchin has been at the forefront of congressional negotiations surrounding the stimulus bill since the start, steering it from its trillion-dollar beginnings to a final total more than double that cost. A highlight of the bill is its $1,200 checks for individual Americans. Mnuchin will be responsible for ensuring those checks actually get distributed, and has so far been hopeful â€” perhaps unrealistically so â€” that they'll be out by April. The bill also contains a $500 billion funding program, and Mnuchin will oversee how it's distributed to local and state governments, as well as businesses, the Post notes. He'll undoubtedly face pressure from corporate executives looking for bailouts from that fund, and will have to weigh those pleas alongside the needs of taxpayers. Mnuchin will remain 'under constant scrutiny by Democrats, Republicans, a new inspector general, a new congressional oversight panel, as well as [President] Trump' as these disbursals go on, the Post notes. But he's so far gotten both sides of the aisle and the president onboard with the bill, even as Trump reportedly fielded dozens of calls complaining about what was inside it.

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/lifestyle/travel/article/I-went-on-vacation-to-another-country-and-15160849.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five years ago, I spent the second week of March undergoing my third round of chemotherapy - the 11th week since a cancer diagnosis changed everything in an instant. My red blood cell counts were so low that I couldn't walk up the stairs in my house without resting halfway up.  This year I spent the second week of March with my boyfriend at a backcountry ski lodge in the Canadian Rockies, acutely aware of how fortunate I was to again have the physical health and strength to take a vacation that required climbing mountains.  The skiing was phenomenal and the scenery stunning. For seven days straight, I had to do nothing but eat, ski and sleep. Icefall Lodge was magical.  Our third day at the lodge, the World Health Organization declared covid-19 a global pandemic. But I didn't know this at the time. After a helicopter deposited Derek, me, and 13 other skiers and snowboarders from the United States, Canada and Australia at the lodge - in winter, a 20-minute helicopter flight is the only way to get to Icefall - I was completely disconnected.  Icefall Lodge has access to about 10 times the amount of terrain as Whistler Blackcomb Resort, the largest ski resort in North America, but it does not have cellphone service. (Neither does it have flush toilets or hot running water.)  My main concern there was over what kind of sandwich I should make and bring with me for lunch. Looking back, having the bandwidth to fret over something as silly as whether I'd want ham and cheese or peanut butter when lunch rolled around was among the lodge's ultimate luxuries.  When I received a cancer diagnosis, my life immediately and completely changed, but the world stayed the same. While I was at Icefall Lodge, this reversed itself. When we emerged, I was the same and it was the world that was...</description>
