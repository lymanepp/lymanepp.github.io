      <title>Merry Christmas, you're being impeached... </title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Bill Clinton stood at a lectern in the Rose Garden, surrounded by supporters, including his wife, first lady Hillary Clinton. The votes had been counted, and the news had arrived: He was being impeached.  "I hope there will be a constitutional and fair means of resolving this matter in a prompt manner," he said. "Meanwhile, I will continue to do the work of the American people."  He decried the "excessive partisanship" and "obsessive animosity" of the day. Then he turned around, shook hands, walked back into the White House and threw a Christmas party.  In an amazing episode of "history repeats itself," the House is expected to vote to impeach President Donald Trump on Dec. 18 - one day short of the 21st anniversary of the House voting to impeach Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. Both arrived awkwardly in the holiday season known for "glad tidings" and "goodwill toward men."  Clinton wasn't the only one attempting holiday merriment that day in 1998. In the Capitol, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who chaired the House Judiciary Committee overseeing the impeachment at the time, scheduled the committee's holiday party for the same time as the impeachment vote. (The vote was later moved from Thursday to Saturday.)  Some Democrats were offended by the double-booking, The New York Times reported.  "It should do wonders for holiday cheer," Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., said sarcastically.  In the halls of the Capitol, CNN correspondent Bob Franken struggled to be heard on-air over a boombox blasting "O Tannenbaum."  And it wasn't just Dec. 19 where impeachment and the holidays intertwined. Ten days earlier, at the very moment Clinton lit the National Christmas Tree, House Republicans unveiled their four articles of impeachment against the president. (Only two were passed by the...</description>

      <title>UPDATE: Pastors, Politicians Slam NETFLIX Over Gay Jesus...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Pastors-politicians-slam-Brazilian-Christmas-14912291.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Depictions of Jesus Christ in film, art, and beyond are no stranger to controversy, with portrayals of the religious figure depicted as homeless or submerged in urine drawing ire over the years.  Now, a Portuguese-language Christmas special on Netflix is catching fierce backlash from religious leaders and right-wing political figures, including the Brazilian president's son, for implying that the religious figure is gay.  Since its release on the streaming service earlier this month, "The First Temptation of Christ" has spawned multiple online campaigns that call on Brazilian authorities to ban the special and criminally charge its creators with "vilification of faith." As of early Tuesday, one petition had been signed by nearly 2 million people.  The Netflix film tells the story of Jesus returning home from the desert for his 30th birthday, in a highly satirical format. Mary and God are portrayed as illicit lovers, Joseph is a bumbling carpenter who can't build a table, and the Three Kings try to pass off ham as "free-range soy."  And Jesus, the movie suggests, seems to have done more than wandering around the desert for 40 days. Arriving in Nazareth, he brings along a flamboyant companion, Orlando, who implies at nearly every turn that he and the son of God are romantically involved, at one point calling him a "naughty Capricorn."  As Orlando, the walking stereotype of an effeminate gay man, begins to describe how the pair met - "I was bathing in an oasis, and I was naked" - Jesus abruptly cuts him off to prevent more from being revealed.  "And then I asked for directions," Jesus says. "I asked, and he gave it to me."  "You bet I did," Orlando responds, nail file in hand. "I sure gave it to him."  It's tongue-in-cheek moments like this one that have scandalized the deeply...</description>
