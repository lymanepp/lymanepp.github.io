Attorney General Tarek William Saab said the appointments by Guaido and his National Assembly are part of an illegal power grab backed by foreign governments.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden was going to decide whether to run for president by the end of 2018. That deadline slipped. Just after New Year's, he said he would decide "soon." Mid-January came and went with no decision. By the end of January? "We'll make the decision soon," he said at the time. Now into mid-February, with a burgeoning field of Democratic candidates, Biden is still on the fence, neither in nor out, in a lingering state of political limbo. Some potential staffers have already defected, and some of his supporters worry the prolonged indecision could begin to threaten his chances.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A novice politician hailing from the New York borough of Queens gains enormous media attention and a huge and wildly passionate following in part by lobbing irregular critiques at the news media. Donald Trump in 2015? Yes. But also Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, circa 2019. Their backgrounds, gender and - especially - their politics are different, but the Republican president and the outspoken freshman Democratic congresswoman from New York share at least one similarity: Neither has been shy about using social media to pummel the press. And like Trump, Ocasio-Cortez has been cheered on by millions of followers when she does so.</description>

He appears to be picking up where he left off last summer, when he won the 100 and finished second in the 200 in his age group at the AAU championships.</description>
