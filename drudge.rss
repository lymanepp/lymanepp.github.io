      <title>Sanders and Buttigieg battle in NH...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Sanders-and-Buttigieg-aren-t-competing-for-the-15042512.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MANCHESTER, N.H. - The two top finishers in last week's Iowa caucuses, 40 years apart in age and representing opposite ends of the Democratic Party's ideological spectrum, are heading for a showdown in Tuesday's primary here - each taking increasingly aggressive swipes at the other.  But there is an unusual twist to the new rivalry between Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg.  The senator from Vermont and former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, are not fighting to win over the same pool of New Hampshire voters, though many likely to vote here remain undecided. Rather, according to strategists in both campaigns, each is trying to energize his supporters by vowing to block the other from winning the Democratic nomination - with Sanders, the democratic socialist, portraying Buttigieg as a captive to his billionaire donors, and the more centrist Buttigieg railing against Sanders as a "my way or the highway" leftist.  That effort burst into full view Sunday, when the candidates hopscotched across the snow-covered state.  At a canvass launch in Plymouth, Sanders accused Buttigieg of being in the pocket of his wealthy donors. "Our views are different," Sanders said, repeating an argument he has made frequently in recent days.  "Pete has raised campaign contributions from over 40 billionaires," he said, adding that those donors are drawn to Buttigieg precisely because he will not, in Sanders's view, take on "the corporate elite."  Buttigieg, meanwhile, continued to paint Sanders as divisive.  "I respect Senator Sanders, but when I hear this message go out that you're either for revolution or you've got to be for the status quo, that's a vision of the country that doesn't have room for most of us," Buttigieg said.  At another event Sunday, he pushed his usual critique further, calling...</description>

      <title>In Iowa's Obama-Trump counties, Dems didn't turn out... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/In-Iowa-s-Obama-Trump-counties-Democrats-didn-t-15042475.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DES MOINES - By Tuesday, most of the campaign signs that had been lining the neighborhood streets here for months were gone, pried out of the frozen ground almost instantaneously, as if the election had never happened, as if people were anxious to forget.  The uncertainty over who would emerge victorious from Monday's Iowa caucuses would continue for days - and still does, even as the state Democratic Party announced Thursday it had finally counted all the results after technical and logistical problems prompted chaos and delays in the first nominating contest of the 2020 primary.  Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg both claimed victory in a race so tight that the Associated Press announced it could not declare a winner. And amid reports of miscounts and faulty delegate math, there has been enduring drama about what to do. Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called for a full re-canvass of the results and then dialed that back. The Iowa Democratic Party announced it would review results from 95 problematic precincts and then extended its deadline for candidate re-canvassing requests to Monday. It has all served to extend even further the political hangover of weary Iowans who had labored to make sure the caucuses worked smoothly, only to see it all explode.  "We're actively testing Dante's circles of hell," one local Democratic Party official said just hours after the state party held a Wednesday night conference call with county chairs to divulge even more chaos in the process, including claims that a hotline set up for caucus leaders to phone in results had been swamped by prank calls from supporters of President Donald Trump after the number was posted on social media.  For all the drama, including the concern that the mishandling of the results...</description>
