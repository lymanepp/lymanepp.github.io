      <title>Trapped on virus-ravaged cruise ship, shocked passengers struggle to keep spirits up...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Trapped-on-virus-ravaged-cruise-ship-shocked-15031425.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;YOKOHAMA, Japan - Quarantined for two weeks on a cruise ship ravaged by coronavirus, the Britons on board have only one option: keep calm and carry on.  David Abel and his wife Sally are still smiling, for now. Their friends Alan and Wendy Steele are going "stir crazy" trapped in their cabin - although they say they are not worried about catching the deadly illness. Still, this was not how the Steeles planned to spend their honeymoon.  Many of the 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members on the Diamond Princess are struggling to keep their spirits up, after the luxury liner was quarantined off the Japanese coast Wednesday, with passengers forbidden to leave their cabins.  Last Saturday, a man from Hong Kong who had spent five days aboard the ship was confirmed as having contracted coronavirus. On Wednesday, with the ship docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan's Health Ministry said nine other passengers and one Filipino crew member had tested positive.  "We've got two weeks' extra cruise, albeit a confined cruise," David Abel, 74, said on a Skype call from his cabin. "You've got to make the best of the situation, haven't you? But I'm sure that in 10 or 12 days' time, I'll be pulling my hair out."  The nine passengers who tested positive - two Australians, three from Japan, three from Hong Kong, and one American - have been transferred to hospitals, but none is in serious condition, said Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato. They were among 31 people deemed at high risk who were initially examined for the virus, while samples from 242 other people are still being tested.  For those left on board, there is nothing to do but sit in their cabins, wait for meals to be delivered, watch television or a choose from a limited selection of movies on demand. Those lucky enough to have a balcony can at least sit in the sun, look at...</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/A-Chinese-doctor-was-one-of-the-first-to-warn-15028767.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As word of a mysterious virus mounted, Li Wenliang shared suspicions in a private chat with his fellow medical school alumni.  The doctor said that seven people seemed to have contracted SARS - the respiratory illness that spread from China to more than two dozen countries and left hundreds dead in the early 2000s. One patient was quarantined at his hospital in Wuhan, Li said. He urged people to be careful.  Li and seven other doctors were quickly summoned by Chinese authorities for propagating "rumors" about SARS-like cases in the area - but their warnings were prescient. Soon, health officials around the world would be scrambling to combat a novel virus with a striking genetic resemblance to SARS. The outbreak in Wuhan has exploded to more than 20,000 confirmed cases just in China.  Among the ill: the ophthalmologist who was censured for sounding an early alarm.  "The diagnosis is finally confirmed," Li posted Jan. 31 on the social media platform Weibo.  Li's situation has drawn rare acknowledgment of official missteps in China, where a bureaucratic culture that prioritizes political stability over all else probably allowed the new coronavirus to spread farther and faster. Late last month, China's highest court admonished the Wuhan police for the detentions.  "If society had at the time believed those 'rumors,' and wore masks, used disinfectant and avoided going to the wildlife market as if there were a SARS outbreak, perhaps it would've meant we could better control the coronavirus today," the court said. "Rumors end when there is openness."  Li, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, had shared his concerns the same day that Chinese authorities confirmed they were investigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia. Officials at the epicenter in Wuhan - the capital of...</description>
