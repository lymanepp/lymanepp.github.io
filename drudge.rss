      <title>Urges party to learn from past lessons... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Hillary-Clinton-urges-party-to-learn-from-2016-s-15496901.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hillary Clinton's address Wednesday at the Democratic National Convention will in many ways mark a close to nearly four years of serving as President Donald Trump's primary foil.  Since Clinton's upset loss to Trump in 2016, many Democrats have seen her as the rightful winner - robbed by the electoral college, Russia's intervention and her own mistakes. For Trump supporters, who cheered his promises to "lock her up," Clinton remains the personification of the liberal establishment and all that Trump is fighting.  On Wednesday, Clinton cedes the role of anti-Trump to Joe Biden and the status of exciting trailblazer to Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California.  Still popular with many Democrats, blamed by others for losing in 2016 and divisive for much of the country, the first woman to head a major-party ticket serves Wednesday as a bridge to another historic first - and a warning of all that can go wrong.  "For four years, people have said to me, 'I didn't realize how dangerous he was!' 'I wish I could go back and do it over!' Or worst - 'I should have voted!' " Clinton plans to say, according to early excerpts. 'Well, this can't be another 'woulda, coulda, shoulda' election."  Had Clinton won, this convention would be a celebration of her first-term accomplishments and a rallying cry for another four years. Instead, it's a nightly siren blast against what Clinton and other Democrats call Trump's efforts to suppress votes or invite foreign interference.  "If you vote by mail, request your ballot now and send it back as soon as you can. If you vote in person, do it early," Clinton plans to say. "Bring a friend and wear a mask. Become a poll worker. Most of all, no matter what, vote."  Wednesday evening is to be devoted in part to recognizing women, a bittersweet moment for...</description>

      <title>Stock market would be in red without handful of familiar names...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/Rising-stock-market-would-be-in-the-red-without-a-15496648.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five hundred companies make up Wall Street's most widely used measure of the stock market's performance: the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. If it were not for just six of them, the benchmark would be down this year.  That's the bad news. The good news is that thanks to these six highflying stocks - including Apple, which on Wednesday became the first company to be valued at $2 trillion - the S&amp;P 500 has powered through the coronavirus pandemic to gain almost 5 percent and set a record.  Along with Apple, the overachievers - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft and Google's parent, Alphabet - are household names that have leveraged digital expertise to prosper amid the new, socially distanced reality. Through Tuesday, these six stocks collectively were up more than 43 percent this year, while the rest of the companies in the index together lost about 4 percent.  "These are sound companies that have been able to grow their earnings," Ed Yardeni, a prominent investment strategist with Yardeni Research, said of the big tech stocks. "They've benefited from delivering goods and services in the pandemic. These are the companies at the very epicenter of booming demand."  The market's growing reliance on a handful of technology industry heavyweights, however, underscores a societal dominance that may be distorting investment signals, spawning a winner-take-all economy and warping political debates, critics have said. As the tech-dependent S&amp;P 500 roared back from its pandemic crash earlier this year, these companies faced growing political opposition, including the threat of regulatory action in the United States and Europe aimed at curbing their influence.  "The regulatory environment next year is going to be brutal for these companies. It doesn't make any difference who the [U.S.] president is," said Roger...</description>

      <title>This moment, long desired by Biden, is not what he envisioned...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/This-moment-long-desired-by-Biden-is-not-what-15496747.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 21-year-old Joe Biden was in the Bahamas for spring break, smitten by the blond woman he saw sunbathing outside the British Colonial Hotel.  The beach was open only to guests at the luxury resort, so Biden, unable to afford a room there, snatched a hotel towel and pretended to belong.  He introduced himself, took a seat at the end of her chair - and, before long, he was revealing his aspirations, with a fair amount of youthful bluster.  "He's going to be a senator by the time he's 30," his future wife, Neilia, later told one of her close friends of the 1964 encounter. "And he's going to be president of the United States."  As newlyweds, they named their German shepherd puppy Senator, and Biden quickly set about accomplishing that first goal, winning his seat in the Senate in 1972, on schedule at the age of 29.  The second goal proved more elusive. Nearly every four years since 1980, Biden considered a presidential run - and yet it never seemed like his time.  He ran in 1988 in his mid-40s as a champion for a new generation, then dropped out in humiliating fashion over allegations that he plagiarized a speech. He tried again in 2008 as an experienced insider, only to watch in frustration as all the attention focused on the party's two biggest celebrities, Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. As the outgoing vice president in 2016, Biden pondered a run but bowed out as establishment support coalesced around Clinton.  Now, in 2020, Biden finally stands on the brink of realizing the ultimate achievement he predicted 56 years earlier, preparing to address the nation Thursday night as the Democratic nominee for president. But it is hardly the triumph he might have imagined as a starry-eyed college student.  At 77, he faces questions of whether he could serve two full terms....</description>

      <title>Manafort promoted Russian disinfo that has been embraced by Trump... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/How-Paul-Manafort-promoted-Russian-disinformation-15496684.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The effort began only days after Paul Manafort resigned as chairman of Donald Trump's presidential campaign in August 2016.  Manafort faced scrutiny for accepting millions in off-book payments from pro-Russian Ukrainian officials - an uncomfortable situation for the longtime lobbyist, since accusations were then emerging that Russia was interfering in the White House race to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.  According to a new bipartisan report by the Senate Intelligence Committee released Tuesday, Manafort began quickly working with a Russian employee based in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on a counternarrative - that it was the Ukrainians who were actually interfering in the U.S. election, not Russia, and that they were framing Manafort to help the Democrats.  That claim has persisted ever since, even after U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials said it had no merit - promoted by Russian President Vladimir Putin abroad and President Trump himself at home.  It has been embraced by Trump's allies in conservative media and in Congress. It was touted on the right during Trump's impeachment last year and has carried into the present as the backdrop to an ongoing GOP effort to use Ukraine to attack Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.  In fact, the idea that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 campaign began as a Russian influence operation designed to distract attention from the Kremlin's own activities that year, the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded after an exhaustive three-year investigation.  It was advanced for years by Manafort's employee, Konstantin Kilimnik, whom the committee identified as a Russian intelligence officer who, among other things, used a false persona on Twitter to circulate and promote the Ukrainian counternarrative, the...</description>

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/932323/gop-exrep-charlie-dent-who-resigned-after-trumps-election-endorses-biden</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Rep. Charlie Dent's 2020 vote may be an indicator of how Pennsylvania will lean in November's election. On Wednesday, the Pennsylvania Republican told CNN he would be endorsing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Dent resigned in 2018 after refusing to vote for President Trump in the 2016 election, and now joins a wave of Republicans explicitly supporting Biden. Dent is supporting Biden because the country needs 'to return some sense of normalcy to the function of government,' he told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday. 'this isn't about right or left, it's not about ideology,' Dent, a CNN contributor, continued. 'To me, it's about right or wrong, stability versus instability, security versus insecurity, you know, normal versus abnormal.' Dozens of Republicans have endorsed Biden over the past few weeks, with former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and Cindy McCain even appearing at the Democratic National Convention to support him. And Dan Wasserman of The Cook Political Report doesn't think Dent will be the last. Kathryn Krawczyk Based on my interactions, I'd guess at least several dozen of the 241 Republicans in the House at the time Trump was sworn into office in 2017 plan on voting for Biden. https://t.co/ZisNP8Nkco â€” Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) August 19, 2020</description>
