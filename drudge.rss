      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;VIJAYAWADA, India -The four-lane highway stretches across this flat, riverine part of southern India, flanked by fields of rice and sugar cane. My guide twists around from the passenger seat to offer some advice: Keep a low profile and don't take pictures. The activity we seek is "strictly prohibited," he explains. But he assures me his brother-in-law will know where to go. It is the first day of Makar Sankranti, a major festival that takes place each January to celebrate the harvest and the advent of longer days. People light bonfires, discarding the old and welcoming the new. They prepare feasts and create intricate decorations made from brightly colored powders. And they hold cockfights - many, many cockfights.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEIJING (AP) — Asia welcomed the lunar Year of the Pig on Tuesday with visits to temples, family banquets and the world's biggest travel spree. Celebrations took place throughout the region, from Beijing and Seoul to Hanoi and Singapore. The streets of Beijing and other major Chinese cities were quiet and empty after millions of people left to visit relatives or travel abroad during the year's biggest family holiday. Families gathered at home for multigenerational banquets. Companies, shops and government offices closed for official holidays that ranged from two days in South Korea to a week in China.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Beto O'Rourke's weeks of near-silence end on a massive stage when he sits down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey. The appearance Tuesday on "Oprah's SuperSoul Conversations from Times Square" comes ahead of a possible presidential campaign and puts O'Rourke's charisma put to the test. O'Rourke dazzled Democrats last year by nearly defeating Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in the country's largest red state. But his presidential prospects have been overshadowed more recently with the generally well-received 2020 campaign launches of Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — If the pooch melts your heart, swipe right. Animal lovers in Lithuania have created a mobile application inspired by the popular dating app Tinder to match up dogs in local shelters with new owners. Called GetPet, the app was launched last month and is getting hundreds of new users daily and already has made a few matches. It joins a growing market of apps for people looking to adopt a pet, including PawsLikeMe and BarkBuddy. "It is like Tinder, but with dogs," said Vaidas Gecevicius, one of app's creators. "You can arrange a meeting with the dog — a date."</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/Palate-grows-for-sommeliers-13587701.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;My training as a honey sommelier at the American Honey Tasting Society culminates with eight wineglasses filled with various honeys, lined up from light to dark. My instructor, Carla Marina Marchese, tells me that when we taste honey, we don't do the ceremonial swirl - the wine expert's ritual - before we sniff. Honey sommeliers smear. "Smear it on the sides of the glass like this," she says, using a tiny plastic spoon. Once the honey is smeared, I can stick my nose in the glass to properly evaluate the aroma, then spoon a dollop onto my tongue. Marchese is leading me through an abbreviated version of her $595, four-day honey sensory certification course.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ATLANTA (AP) — Graying but still gritty, Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and the Patriots came to the Super Bowl intending to stave off, for at least one more game, the inevitable onslaught of the NFL's future. Job well done. Pro football never looked flatter, older and more stuck in the days of the VCR than it did Sunday. In a Super Bowl only New England could love, the Patriots won their sixth title by lumbering their way to a 13-3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams — that young, brash, high-flying team with the 33-year-old coach and the 24-year-old quarterback who were, we thought, changing football before our very eyes.</description>

      <link>https://apnews.com/0ddb190d6c3d46a0be910aadf61e3564</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The Latest on Pope Francis's visit to the United Arab Emirates (all times local): 8 p.m. The head of Sunni Islam's highest seat of learning has told an audience that includes Pope Francis and hundreds of other religious figures from around the world that Islam is a religion of peace that values human life. At an event Monday evening during the first-ever papal visit to the Gulf, Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the head of Al-Azhar, quoted numerous Quranic verses about the value of life, including one that says: "Whoever kills a person it is as though he has killed all mankind. And whoever saves a life, it is as though he had saved all mankind." The grand mufti said all faiths denounce terrorism in all its forms and that acts of terrorism are carried out by criminals, not by true believers of God. The sheikh said that after the 9/11 attacks the media made Islam look like a "bloodthirsty" religion and that Muslims paid a heavy price for the acts of a few. He spoke after the Muslim Council of Elders and the pope met for an interreligious dialogue that recognized efforts by the pope and al-Tayeb to foster peace.</description>
