      <title>Woman Possibly Cured of HIV -- Without Medical Treatment...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-Woman-May-Have-Been-Cured-of-HIV-Without-15516582.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A woman who was infected with HIV in 1992 may be the first person cured of the virus without a risky bone marrow transplant or even medications, researchers reported Wednesday.  In an additional 63 people in their study who controlled the infection without drugs, HIV apparently was sequestered in the body in such a way that it could not reproduce, the scientists also reported. The finding suggested that these people may have achieved a "functional cure."  The research, published in the journal Nature, outlines a new mechanism by which the body may suppress HIV, visible only now because of advances in genetics. The study also offers hope that some small number of infected people who have taken antiretroviral therapy for many years may similarly be able to suppress the virus and stop taking the drugs, which can exact a toll on the body.  "It does suggest that treatment itself can cure people, which goes against all the dogma," said Dr. Steve Deeks, an AIDS expert at the University of California, San Francisco, and an author of the new study.  The woman is Loreen Willenberg, 66, of California, already famous among researchers because her body has suppressed the virus for decades after verified infection. Only two other people - Timothy Brown of Palm Springs, California, and Adam Castillejo of London - have been declared cured of HIV. Both men underwent grueling bone marrow transplants for cancer that left them with immune systems resistant to the virus.  Bone marrow transplants are too risky to be an option for most people infected with HIV, but the recoveries raised hopes that a cure was possible. In May, researchers in Brazil reported that a combination of HIV treatments may have led to another cure, but other experts said more tests were needed to confirm that...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, declared during his Republican National Convention speech that Trump 'successfully fought' the coronavirus pandemic, which is still very much raging in the United States. His use of the past tense was quickly picked up by several journalists, including David Corn of Mother Jones, who tweeted that Kudlow spoke 'as if this crisis is over. Thousands are dying every week. This is crazy propaganda.' Tim O'Brien, a Bloomberg Opinion writer, pointed out that Kudlow has been beating this drum for awhile now, saying on March 9 that the coronavirus was 'relatively contained.' In late June, right before a major surge in cases, Kudlow declared there was 'no second wave coming. It's just hot spots. They send in CDC teams, we've got the testing procedures, we've got the diagnostics.' On Tuesday, the coronavirus death toll in the United States climbed to more than 178,000.
