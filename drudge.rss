      <title>DC HATE:  Ocasio-Cortez, Omar say they're targeted with death threats... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ocasio-Cortez-Omar-say-they-re-targeted-with-13757991.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, two high-profile freshmen Democrats who engender intense emotions on the right, each spoke out Wednesday about how efforts to vilify them have made them a target of death threats.  Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who has become Republicans' preferred foil, responded on Twitter to a fundraising email solicitation from the Ohio Federation of College Republicans with the subject line: "AOC is a domestic terrorist."  Dave Levinthal, the federal politics editor at the Center for Public Integrity, shared it on Twitter and noted that the term was "often reserved for the likes of Timothy McVeigh and people who kill children in their school classrooms."  "This puts me in danger every time," Ocasio-Cortez wrote, retweeting Levinthal. "Almost every time this uncalled for rhetoric gets blasted by conserv. grps, we get a spike in death threats to refer to Capitol Police. Multiple ppl have been arrested trying to harm me, Ilhan, &amp; others. @GOP, what's it going to take to stop?"  A few weeks ago, Time Magazine reported that Ocasio-Cortez's staff received special training from the Capitol police on how to assess her visitors for potential danger.  "Plenty of fundraising emails from Democrats and Republicans alike are hyperbolic, misleading or contain demonstrable errors," Levinthal, who is an expert in money in politics, said in an email to The Washington Post. "This is the first I've seen that puts a sitting congresswoman on par with mass murderers who blow up buildings or kill schoolchildren."  The House sergeant-at-arms, Paul Irving, in his testimony before the House Administration Committee on Tuesday, said threatening communications have increased threefold in the past several years.  "Members of Congress now receive an unprecedented number of threats and threatening...</description>

      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Frustration-boils-at-US-Mexico-border-checkpoints-13757773.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump paused on the White House South Lawn Wednesday to describe special counsel Robert Mueller III's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election as "illegal," "phony" and "an attempted coup."  It was the latest of Trump's fulsome fulminations against the probe and its still-secret report, which the president had previously declared to be a "complete and total exoneration."  But when the Justice Department releases Mueller's redacted report in coming days, the reality is likely to be far more nuanced - including potentially damaging new details of alleged misdeeds by Trump or his campaign, even if they fall short of criminal wrongdoing.  That puts the president and his defenders in a potentially thorny position: Could Trump's cries of "total exoneration" become his own "Mission Accomplished"?  In 2003, then-President George W. Bush infamously landed on an aircraft carrier - against the backdrop of a huge banner trumpeting "Mission Accomplished" - to announce the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The war in Iraq would drag on for nearly another decade, and Bush's overly confident phrase served as shorthand for the administration's controversial war.  Similarly, hours after Attorney General William Barr released a summary of the Russia report last month, Trump proclaimed on Twitter: "No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION." Now many Democrats and other critics of the president hope to use the report's release to turn Trump's "total exoneration" into a punchline.  Michael Steel, a Republican strategist, said Trump has reason to feel vindicated: "It's an obvious win on the fact that there was no case on collusion," he said. "It's an obvious win that the special prosecutor did not choose to indict on...</description>
