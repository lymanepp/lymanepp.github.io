      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LONDON (AP) — British Conservative lawmakers forced a no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Theresa May for Wednesday, throwing U.K. politics deeper into crisis and Brexit further into doubt. May vowed to fight for the leadership of her party and the country "with everything I've got" after opponents who have been circling for weeks finally got the numbers they needed to spark a vote among Conservative Party lawmakers later in the day. The leadership challenge marks a violent eruption of the Conservative Party's decades-long divide over Europe.</description>

Joshua Trump’s problems started in elementary school, when the 45th president announced his candidacy, but the boy’s parents thought things might be different in middle school. “He was being ridiculed and bullied</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Spacewalking astronauts ripped through thick insulation on a capsule docked to the International Space Station on Tuesday, looking for clues to a mysterious drilled hole that leaked precious cabin air four months ago. Russians Sergei Prokopyev and Oleg Kononenko spotted the tiny hole in the external hull of the Soyuz capsule, more than five hours into their grueling spacewalk. "That is exactly the hole we've been looking for, guys," radioed Russian Mission Control outside Moscow. The spacewalkers reported seeing no drill marks around the black dot, like on the inside.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is citing a shooting attack in France as he calls on Democratic congressional leaders to support funding for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump tweeted Wednesday: "Another very bad terror attack in France. We are going to strengthen our borders even more. Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!" That's a reference to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who met with Trump Tuesday. A suspected extremist sprayed gunfire at a Christmas market in the city of Strasbourg Tuesday, killing three and wounding at least 13.</description>

      <title>Moment of reckoning looms for Michael Cohen...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — The moment of reckoning has nearly arrived for Michael Cohen, who finds out Wednesday whether his decision to walk away from President Donald Trump after years of unwavering loyalty will spare him from a harsh prison sentence. A federal judge in New York is set to decide whether Cohen gets leniency or years in prison for crimes including tax evasion, making illegal hush-money payments to protect Trump during the campaign and lying to Congress about the president's past business dealings in Russia. Few observers expect the hearing to go well for the 52-year-old attorney.</description>

When President Trump selected Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, I knew it was at least a very risky pick. But he won the hearts of conservatives because of the insanity of the opposition. Now we know, for certain, that Brett Kavanaugh is a […]</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - In his first two years in office, President Donald Trump operated without a clear check on his power. With his party controlling both houses of Congress, he issued demands from his bedroom in the form of early-morning tweets, and legislative leaders got in line. He rarely was personally confronted about his untruths and misstatements. And he mostly ignored congressional Democrats, choosing to spar instead with journalists. That all came to a crashing halt Tuesday. In an extraordinarily heated public fight with the nation's top two Democratic leaders, the combustible president confronted for the first time the enormity of the challenge he will face over the next two years: divided government.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes veered through another dizzying cycle Tuesday, shooting to big gains early in the morning before falling modestly in midday trading. By early afternoon, indexes were mixed. It's just the latest in a series of sharp turns in direction for the market, which has lurched up and mostly down since late September as investors recalibrate how worried they are about the global trade war, rising interest rates and a slowing economy. The S&amp;amp;P 500 initially jumped more than 1 percent, following even bigger gains in Europe, on optimism about U.S.-China trade talks. But falling bank stocks helped weigh on indexes as the day went on.</description>
