      <title>Podcasts killing music or just wasting our time?</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/entertainment/article/Are-podcasts-killing-music-or-just-wasting-our-13775490.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm about to kick a hornet's nest - and if this were a podcast, you would now hear the crunch of a boot perforating a hive, followed by the intensifying hum of inconvenienced hornets. But, fortunately, this isn't a podcast, so my punt shall remain silent, and here it is: I'm against podcasts.  I think they're tedious and samey and sedative, and when I'm feeling especially cranky, I consider them an enemy of music. Most podcasts are conversations for people to eavesdrop on - recorded talk that precludes real-life talk about real life with zombie talk about podcasts. Also, I like music. With all of the world's unheard songs beckoning us with their endless mystery, why would anyone choose to waste their precious listening hours on a podcast?  Asking that question makes me feel very alone. In a March cover story, New York Magazine called the podcast "the most significant and exciting cultural innovation of the new century," offering lots of boffo numbers to back it up. First, there were those 340 million downloads of "Serial," the true-crime investigative blockbuster that made "podcast" a household word back in 2014. Then there was that $230 million transaction in February, when Spotify bought the podcast network Gimlet Media, foreshadowing juicier deals to come. And now there are well over a half-million podcasts currently in circulation, with new ones sprouting each day.  This is a serious new form, and it's generating serious money - so instead of treating podcasts as a convenient way to feel smarter, let's take them seriously. Let's measure their worth by truly listening.  Like it or not, they're invading a soundworld near you. The marquee names of podcasting - "Pod Save America," "The Joe Budden Podcast," "Terrible, Thanks for Asking" and many others - are currently appearing on actual marquees, bringing their...</description>

      <title>BALZ: Buttigieg has been surprise of Dem field. Where does he go next? </title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Buttigieg-has-been-the-surprise-of-the-Democratic-13782776.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is on a trajectory that few people would have imagined when he first formed his presidential exploratory committee. His poise and thoughtfulness have produced accolades on Twitter and cable TV that must make him blush at times. But his performance has made him the surprise factor in the Democratic nomination race.  What happens as the campaign moves ahead is the interesting question. History is an uncertain guide but still worth examining as Buttigieg tries to capitalize on the attention he has gotten. Is he a genuine breakthrough candidate, whose rise to prominence shatters both barriers and expectations? Or is he like some candidates of the past, who found a following within a segment of their party's electorate - or the attention of the media - but could not move beyond it?  Several past candidates come to mind in trying to assess the Buttigieg phenomenon. One is Barack Obama. Another is former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley. A third is former Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt. All had their moments. All were the subject of favorable and sometimes gushing media coverage. Only Obama went on to become both his party's nominee and president of the United States.  Obama is the candidate anyone like Buttigieg would like to become: a history-maker, an outsider who shook the system, a political meteor who flashed across the nation's screens but didn't burn out. Obama's 2004 keynote speech to the Democratic National Convention turned him into an overnight political celebrity. By the time he announced his candidacy for president more than two years later (and after election to the U.S. Senate), he was already destined to become the most serious challenger to Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic nomination.  Buttigieg's rise has been far more condensed - and limited. He formed his...</description>
