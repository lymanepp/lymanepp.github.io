      <title>Harvey Reaches $25M Settlement With His Accusers...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Weinstein-and-His-Accusers-Reach-Tentative-25-14899445.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;After two years of legal wrangling, Harvey Weinstein and the board of his bankrupt film studio have reached a tentative $25 million settlement agreement with dozens of his alleged sexual misconduct victims, a deal that would not require the Hollywood producer to admit wrongdoing or pay anything to his accusers himself, according to lawyers involved in the negotiations.  The proposed global legal settlement has gotten preliminary approval from all the major parties involved, according to several of the lawyers. More than 30 actresses and former Weinstein employees, who in lawsuits have accused Weinstein of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape, would share in the payout - along with potential claimants who could join in coming months. The deal would bring to an end nearly every such lawsuit against him and his former company.  The settlement would require court approval and a final signoff by all parties. It would be paid by insurance companies representing the producer's former studio, the Weinstein Company. Because the business is in bankruptcy proceedings, the women have had to make their claims along with its creditors. The payout to the accusers would be part of an overall $47 million settlement intended to close out the company's obligations, according to a half-dozen lawyers, some of whom spoke about the proposed terms on the condition of anonymity.  Representatives for Weinstein declined to comment. Lawyers did not respond to requests for comment for board members and other parties.  Weinstein is scheduled to be tried in New York in early January on charges of sexual assault involving two women. While his criminal prosecution has drawn public attention, the largely hidden negotiations over civil claims have been far more consequential for many of his accusers, who include women from the United...</description>

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-returns-to-Pennsylvania-rallying-for-14897350.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HERSHEY, Pa. - President Donald Trump returned to Pennsylvania for the fourth time this year on Tuesday, rallying loyal supporters here as part of his campaign's concerted effort to retain control of a state that helped lift him into the White House in 2016 and is likely critical to his reelection chances.  Trump's visit came on the same day that House Democrats officially introduced articles of impeachment against him, and the president struck a fiery note, railing against both the Democrats and the media from the earliest moments of his rally.  Calling the articles of impeachment "flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous," Trump dismissed the inquiry against him as the "impeachment crap," and said that any Democrat who votes for it would be sacrificing not just their House majority but their dignity.  "Everybody said, 'This is impeachment lite. This is the lightest impeachment in the history of the country, by far,' " Trump said. "It's not even an impeachment."  He added, later: "They're impeaching me because they want to win an election and that's the only way they can do it."  Trump rallied at the Giant Center, a 12,500-seat arena best known for hosting concerts and minor league hockey. He visited here in the closing days of the 2016 bid and during his "thank you" tour in December 2016 after he won the election.  Hershey is home to the Hershey Co., which produces chocolate candy and other sweets in the city.  The region, which is dotted with former mill towns and conservative congressional districts, was central to Trump's 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, with surging turnout in this area and others lifting Trump's statewide total even as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won in Philadelphia and its suburbs.  In the closing days of that race, a wave of navy blue Trump campaign signs...</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/We-ate-their-lunch-Democrats-claim-legislative-14897301.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's top trade official clashed with an influential Republican senator during a conference call Tuesday morning as some GOP discontent and resignation about the revised trade deal with Canada and Mexico began to grow. Congressional Democrats and the White House were separately touting a significant victory.  The frustrations of Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., about provisions of the new North American trade agreement were part of a contentious exchange that came as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer briefed key Senate Republicans on details of the deal, according to three officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the private conversation.  Toomey's aides declined to comment on the private call. But the senator - who had opposed the initial draft of the agreement struck by the Trump administration with Mexico and Canada last year - said the administration had given far too many concessions at the expense of Republican priorities.  "In fairness to Bob Lighthizer, there was a lot of discussion early on. But in the last few weeks, the discussion certainly didn't include me," Toomey said Tuesday. The negotiations "seemed to be a, you know, just a one-way direction in the direction of the Democrats."  The disagreement came amid signs of growing GOP discontent with multiple accommodations President Trump has made to win support from Democrats to secure legislative victories.  The revised trade agreement with Canada and Mexico won the enthusiastic support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday, with the union's backing signaling to many Republicans that the trade deal was perhaps not in their favor. On Monday, lawmakers unveiled a White House-backed defense bill that includes 12 weeks of paid parental leave for...</description>

      <title>Day of history accentuates America's divide...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/A-day-of-history-accentuates-America-s-divide-and-14897153.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - For only the fourth time in the nation's history congressional leaders on Tuesday put forward articles of impeachment against a president, but that milestone was the most predictable of events on a day that accentuated the degree to which the institutions of government are under stress and the citizens they serve are in conflict.  Amid the partisan breakdown over President Donald Trump's conduct in office, there was a rare statement of progress: a deal to cement a new U.S. trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, the only substantial legislative breakthrough of the year and one long sought by the president.  But in today's hyper-polarized environment, agreement among elected leaders - once considered the norm - is now the anomaly. Instead, the House Democrats' march to impeach Trump and the president's continuing war with the FBI over the origins of the Russia investigation more clearly characterized the strained state of the nation and the rising prominence of distorting facts for political gain.  "This moment tells us something about ourselves," said Ted Strickland, a former Democratic governor of Ohio. "Obviously what's happening is polarizing and will probably deepen the anger and the hostility that has characterized our politics for the last few years."  The impeachment proceedings have revealed a Republican Party whose elected officials are loath to acknowledge any wrongdoing by a president who insists he acted perfectly despite evidence to the contrary, let alone the question of whether what he did warrants his removal from office.  Meanwhile, Trump took the Justice Department's inspector general's report on the Russia investigation, which knocked down his long-stated assertion that the probe was political motivated, and used elements of it to continue his attack on the FBI - furthering the divide that...</description>
