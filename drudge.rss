      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bob Woodward told Stephen Colbert President Trump is just wrong in many cases and that we better wake up to what's really going on in an appearance on The Late Show to tout his book. Woodward also responded to Trump bashing his book and calling him a liar. Woodward said he is not and told Trump that the "the truth will emerge" about him.  "He can say anything, but the great editor at the Washington Post, Ben Bradlee, during Watergate, used to always say when there was a contest back and forth that. He said, 'the truth emerges,'" Woodward said.  "And the truth will emerge on this, too," he added.  From Monday's Late Show:  STEPHEN COLBERT, 'LATE SHOW' HOST: How do you feel when the president tweets about you? I think he's called you, what he said, Woodward book is a scam, don't talk the way I'm quoted, if I did, I would not have been elected president, this author uses every trick in the book to demean and belittle, I wish the people could see the real facts, and our country is doing great. How do you feel when the president says you're lying?  BOB WOODWARD, 'FEAR' AUTHOR: I'm not. And, you know, what is the contest in America other than the political contest, it's a contest for the truth, what is the truth, and I'm willing to put myself out here. I've done the work. This is the best reporting that you can do, or that I can do. And for him to get up, look, he has his First Amendment rights, he can say anything, but the great editor at the Washington Post, Ben Bradlee, during Watergate, used to always say when there was a contest back and forth that. He said, 'the truth emerges.'  And the truth will emerge on this, too.  Woodward said this is not how we should be governed:  BOB WOODWARD, 'FEAR' AUTHOR: There are people maybe not enough and not every time saying, wait a minute, this is not what America is, this is not how we should be governed. We need to have a system of a president saying, what's the next stage of good for everyone in the country, not just the base, but what's -- and there is a way to answer that. There are certain things the country needs that are good, that's the president's job.</description>
