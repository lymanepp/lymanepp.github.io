      <title>Israel first country to warn citizens not to travel...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/898497/israel-first-country-warn-citizens-not-travel-abroad-over-coronavirus-fears</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Israel on Wednesday became the first country to officially warn its citizens to avoid any international travel amid fears over the coronavirus outbreak. Several airlines have canceled flights to China, where the respiratory virus originated, and governments have issued warnings about travel to certain countries, but no country has actively urged their citizens avoid traveling abroad at large until now. 'If you don't genuinely have to fly â€” don't do so,' Israel's health ministry said in a statement. Although the majority of cases remain in China, the virus has spread to several other countries. In response to criticism that the country was stoking panic and could cause both economic and diplomatic damage, the health ministry said they'd rather deal with the inconveniences now than be sorry later, The Times of Israel reports. The only confirmed Israeli cases so far involve people who were on a cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan, although South Korea â€” which is experiencing one of the larger outbreaks beyond China â€” reportedly informed Israel over the weekend that a members from a group of pilgrims returned to South Korea from Israel and tested positive for the disease.

      <title>White House struggles to contain public alarm...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/White-House-struggles-to-contain-public-alarm-15084160.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told The Washington Post late Monday that investors should consider "buying these dips" in the stock market amid the coronavirus panic. The message was to take advantage of one-day slumps and "buy low."  After all, the Dow Jones industrial average had just fallen 1,032 points. President Donald Trump tweeted similar guidance thousands of miles away in India.  Less than 24 hours later, the Dow Jones industrial average would fall another 879 points, bringing Trump and Kudlow's economic advice - at least in the short term - under greater scrutiny.  The rosy sheen that Trump, Kudlow, and other White House officials have tried to express about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak has now collided with reality: The coronavirus is spreading, quickly, to more countries. The death toll is rising, and the outbreak is wreaking havoc on global supply chains. Efforts to detect and contain it have failed.  And the White House's efforts to contain and control government messaging on the disease have come under attack. Trump is highly concerned about the market and has encouraged aides not to give predictions that might cause further tremors. He is expected to talk to officials on Wednesday, said aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.  At least publicly, Trump has devoted the majority of his public statements to slamming Democrats or complaining about the criminal justice system. But he has not publicly engaged much about the coronavirus, other than to downplay what he believes the impact will be on the United States. Privately, Trump has become furious about the stock market's slide, according to two people familiar with the president's thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal details.  While he has...</description>
