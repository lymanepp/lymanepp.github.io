      <title>Trump says he's dealmaker-in-chief, but record lists mostly incompletes...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Trump-says-he-s-the-dealmaker-in-chief-but-his-14552319.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Sitting in the Oval Office alongside senior Chinese officials this month, President Donald Trump declared that the United States had reached "a substantial phase one deal" with China - a development that could ease an intensifying trade war that has roiled global markets and hurt many U.S. businesses and consumers.  Within days, however, "the greatest and biggest deal ever made" turned out to be at best a work in progress. Chinese officials signaled they want another round of talks before signing anything, while adding that Trump should scrap a tariff hike scheduled for December before talks proceed.  Nearly three years into his tenure, the president who promised to bring his "Art of the Deal" business savvy to foreign and trade policy has few substantive deals to his name - and is running short on time to deliver big-ticket agreements ahead of Election Day next year.  Trump has launched or proposed roughly two dozen international negotiations - from bold strokes with North Korea and the Taliban to far-fetched suggestions such as the U.S. purchase of Greenland. So far, the results include no grand bargains, some clear failures and numerous incompletes.  In recent days, his lack of dealmaking skills has been on display over Syria, where he has wavered over whether to honor commitments to protect the Kurds from Turkey and when and how many troops in the region will be brought back home.  Trump says he is seeking international agreements that protect American security and sovereignty, and he has pledged to bring millions of lost manufacturing jobs back to the United States. He tells audiences at his campaign rallies that he is succeeding where past presidents have failed and that he isn't afraid to break a little crockery so long as other countries stop taking advantage of the United States.  "After decades of...</description>
