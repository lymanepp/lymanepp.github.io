      <title>Deaths rise...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Virus-deaths-rise-with-records-set-in-hard-hit-15416982.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For weeks this summer, it was a seeming paradox of the coronavirus pandemic: cases in the United States were rising but deaths were falling.  To the Trump administration, this was evidence that its strategy for combating covid-19 was working. To medical experts, it was only a matter of time before the trajectory changed.  And now it has. Nationwide, deaths have begun to rise again. In some of the worst-hit states, especially across the South and the West, new death records are being set daily. As a virus-scarred summer wears on, public health specialists say the numbers are almost certain to continue to climb.  "Even if we could magically lock everyone in their room and no one transmits to anyone, we would still be seeing an increase in deaths for the next several weeks," said Catherine Troisi, an epidemiologist with UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston.  That grim assessment came as the United States on Friday set another record for total cases, with more than 76,000 - including a new high of nearly 15,000 in Texas alone.  More than 900 people died, matching a death count of recent days that has consistently hovered just below 1,000. That is well beneath the toll during the virus's most devastating stretch, in April, when 2,000 or more people were dying daily nationwide. But it is also well above the totals earlier this month, when the average number of daily deaths dropped below 500.  More than 136,000 people in the United States have died of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  The recent increase in fatalities follows a nationwide surge in cases that has brought the country record numbers of new infections. Public health experts have long said that the death count is a lagging indicator - with patients typically taking two to three weeks after...</description>

      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/It-was-like-being-preyed-upon-Federal-officers-15415096.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Federal customs officials said Friday that their agents had detained a demonstrator in Portland, Ore., who had described being "terrified" by an encounter with unidentified men in military fatigues, offering a defense amid intense criticism of accounts of federal officials circulating in the city in unmarked cars.  Mark Pettibone, a 29-year-old demonstrator, told The Washington Post he was scared when men in green military fatigues and generic "police" patches jumped out of an unmarked minivan early Wednesday. Reports of similar incidents have sparked condemnation from civil-rights activists and lawmakers.  Pettibone told The Washington Post in an interview he did not know who detained him. In a statement on Friday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents had taken the action and that they "had information indicating the person in the video was suspected of assaults against federal agents or destruction of federal property."  When the agents approached him, Customs said, "a large and violent mob moved towards their location. For everyone's safety, CBP agents quickly moved the suspect to a safer location for further questioning."  The agency also disputed his description of not knowing who detained him, saying: "The CBP agents identified themselves and were wearing CBP insignia during the encounter. The names of the agents were not displayed due to recent doxing incidents against law enforcement personnel who serve and protect our country."  In Pettibone's account, when several men in fatigues approached him, his first instinct was to run.  He did not know whether the men were police or far-right extremists, who frequently don militarylike outfits and harass left-leaning protesters in Portland. The 29-year-old resident said he made it about a half-block before he...</description>
