      <title>RAMS go for Hollywood sequel...</title>
      <link>https://www.apnews.com/f8fda4d4d2cd4c668feeb2197b0dfa86</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ATLANTA (AP) — Before there was Jared Goff, there was Warren Beatty. Years before Goff or any of today's Rams were born, Beatty had been carried off on his teammates' shoulders to celebrate a Rams title that only Hollywood could dream up. He played quarterback Joe Pendleton in the 1978 Academy Award nominated movie "Heaven Can Wait." At the end, he leads LA to an otherworldly Super Bowl victory over the Steelers. It all happened during a time when the real-life Rams, with Joe Namath, Rosey Grier and the rest of the Fearsome Foursome, embodied everything about Hollywood cool, even if the notion of them winning the Super Bowl felt like something that could only happen in the movies.</description>

      <title>Tiesto the Wayne Newton of 21st century? </title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/entertainment/article/Is-Tiesto-the-Wayne-Newton-of-the-21st-century-13577093.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LAS VEGAS - This is the city where Americans go to have big fun doing things that seem absolutely terrible, and on a recent Saturday night, hundreds of them went to see Tiesto. These bacchanalians were no dopes. The best reason to go see Tiesto at one of his three current Las Vegas nightclub residencies is not because you want to hear the planet's second-highest paid DJ spin swollen, vanilla-sweet dance music, but because you seek the classic Las Vegas experience of low-stakes funtimes staged in an environment of expensive theatricality and unblinking grandeur. In this sense, Tiesto is the Wayne Newton of the 21st century. Everyone else is here to have a great night.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHICAGO (AP) — In Illinois, temperatures could rise by 80 degrees within days. In Michigan, melting snow and rain and a 17-mile ice jam could lead to flooding. Across the Midwest, the sudden warmth was sure to bring more broken roads and busted water mains. The polar vortex that brought many cities to a standstill was expected to end with a rapid thaw that experts say could be unprecedented. But the sudden swing from long johns to light jackets and short sleeves could create problems of its own.</description>

      <title>PELOSI: No wall money in border legislation...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/c2a379abd5fa4297943ac18d1491eef3</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump and congressional negotiations on border security (all times local): 1 p.m. Democrats are offering further details of their border security plan. They unveiled a measure Thursday that would not provide money for President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall and denying his request for additional border agents. The move ignores Trump's warnings that they'd be wasting their time if they don't come up with wall money. The Democratic measure, totaling almost $22 billion for U.S. Customs, the border patrol, and immigration agents, would significantly increase spending for scanners at ports of entry, humanitarian aid for apprehended migrants, and new aircraft to police the U.S.-Mexico border. It would also freeze the number of border patrol agents and block any wall construction in wildlife refuges along the border. I would provide for hiring 1,000 additional customs agents. Negotiators face a Feb. 15 deadline to avert another partial government shutdown.</description>

After a bitter-cold morning with temperatures that sank all the way to minus-48 in northwest Minnesota, with wind chills down to minus-65, the air ostensibly "warmed" Wednesday afternoon, to readings such as minus-18 in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and minus-22 in Rockford, Illinois. But it didn't take long into the late afternoon for the mercury to plummet again to readings well below minus-20, minus-30 and in some locations in north-central Minnesota, minus-40 by Thursday morning.</description>

      <title>Military turning on Maduro?</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/820845/venezuela-opposition-leader-juan-guaid-discloses-clandestine-meetings-military</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a New York Times op-ed published late Wednesday, Venezuelan opposition leader and U.S.-backed interim president Juan GuaidÃ³ made his case that he, rather than President Nicolas Maduro, is the constitutionally legitimate leader of Venezuela. The opposition's plan to manage Maduro's "exit with the minimum of bloodshed," he wrote, is to shore up the opposition-led National Assembly, "consolidate the support of the international community," form "a transitional government," and hold "free elections." GuaidÃ³ added: The transition will require support from key military contingents. We have had clandestine meetings with members of the armed forces and the security forces. We have offered amnesty to all those who are found not guilty of crimes against humanity. The military's withdrawal of support from Mr. Maduro is crucial to enabling a change in government, and the majority of those in service agree that the country's recent travails are untenable. [Juan GuaidÃ³, The New York Times] GuaidÃ³ "did not say who in the military he had been speaking with or what their positions were," BBC News reports. "Venezuela's top military representative to the U.S., Col. JosÃ© Luis Silva, has defected â€” but senior military figures in Venezuela have supported Mr. Maduro," and many of them hold influential posts in his government. So far, the U.S. and more than 20 other nations have recognized GuaidÃ³ as interim president and the European Union says it will do so if Maduro doesn't announce new elections by Sunday, while Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey are among the countries that back Maduro. Maduro told Russia's RIA news agency that he is prepared to hold talks with the opposition "for the good of Venezuela," but GuaidÃ³ writes in the Times that while "Maduro and his henchmen disingenuously propose 'dialogue'" when repression fails, "we have become immune to such manipulation. There are no more stunts left for them to pull." Read the entire op-ed at The New York Times. Peter Weber</description>

      <title>'Mutant' coyotes with icy blue eyes in California...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/science/article/mutant-coyotes-blue-eyes-pt-reyes-photo-13574847.php </link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel Dietrich was driving around Point Reyes National Seashore one afternoon last year when he saw a flash of piercing blue. It was a coyote.  "I passed it, pulled my car over onto the shoulder of the road and waited," said Dietrich, the owner of Point Reyes Safaris, a wildlife and photography tour company.  The coyote eventually sauntered down the hillside to drink from the stream. When it lifted its head, Dietrich snapped a photo. It wasn't until he downloaded the images to his computer that he realized this coyote was distinct from the many he had seen in Point Reyes. It's eyes were a striking blue. Most coyotes have brown irises.  Following that afternoon in January 2018, Dietrich spotted a second blue-eyed coyote in Point Reyes, which he determined was distinct from the first because of an injury to its eye. National Geographic has since tracked down photographs of blue-eyed coyotes taken near Santa Cruz and Sacramento.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will unveil a plan Thursday to dramatically expand the federal estate tax on the wealthy, including a new 77 percent rate on billionaires' estates, as leading Democratic politicians push new taxes on the richest Americans to combat inequality. Sanders's bill, the "For the 99.8% Act," would tax the estates of the 0.2 percent of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million, while the rest of the country "would not see their taxes go up by one penny under this plan," according to aides to the Vermont senator, who is considering a 2020 presidential bid.</description>
