      <title>Inside White House's frantic attempts to minimize crisis...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Inside-Trump-s-frantic-attempts-to-minimize-the-15095593.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Minutes before President Donald Trump was preparing Wednesday to reassure a skittish nation about the coronavirus threat, he received a piece of crucial information: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had identified in California the first U.S. case of the illness not tied to foreign travel, a sign that the virus' spread in the United States was likely to explode.  But when Trump took to the lectern for a news conference intended to bring transparency to the spiraling global crisis, he made no explicit mention of the California case and its implications - and falsely suggested the virus might soon be eradicated in the United States.  "And again, when you have 15 people - and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero - that's a pretty good job we've done," he said.  Trump's playing down of the California patient at his news conference underscores the administration's slapdash and often misleading attempts to contain not just the virus, but also potential political damage from the outbreak - which has tanked financial markets, slowed global commerce and killed some 3,000 people worldwide, including the first U.S. death, announced Saturday.  Since Trump touched down from a two-day trip to India early Wednesday morning, the administration struggled to cope with the fallout from the crisis - shaking up and centralizing its coronavirus response team under the leadership of Vice President Mike Pence, floating plans to stabilize the markets and publicly seeking to minimize the threat posed by the potential pandemic.  Interviews with nearly two dozen administration officials, former White House aides, public health experts and lawmakers - many speaking on the condition of anonymity to share candid assessments and details - portray a White House scrambling to gain control of a...</description>

      <title>WEST COAST ON ALERT...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Virus-reported-in-wider-region-of-the-West-Coast-15095236.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;California reported its second case of community transmission of the coronavirus Friday, and Oregon and Washington announced others just hours later, providing fresh evidence that the deadly virus is circulating in the United States.  Authorities in Santa Clara County, Calif., said a 65-year-old woman had come down with the covid-19 disease without traveling to any countries hit hard by the outbreak or coming in contact with anyone known to have the infection.  In Oregon, officials said a person from Washington County, in the northwest part of the state, had tested positive under similar circumstances. The positive test was conducted by the state's laboratory and is considered "presumptive" until it is confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In Oregon, officials said a person from Washington County, in the northwest part of the state, had tested positive under similar circumstances. The positive test was conducted by the state's laboratory and is considered "presumptive" until it is confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The unnamed Oregon individual is an employee of Forest Hills Elementary School outside Portland but has a job that "does not typically come into contact with students," the Lake Oswego School District wrote to parents in an email obtained by local news. The "few individuals" who did have close contact with the infected person were asked to stay home from work or school for two weeks.  The school will remain close through Wednesday as it is cleaned, the district told parents.  In Washington, state health officials said a high school student in Snohomish County, just north of Seattle, received a "presumptive" positive test in another case of unknown origin.  The Jackson High School student was not...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have the coronavirus. And it hasn't been that bad.  I am in my late 60s, and the sickest I've ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out on my back for a few days. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don't have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual.  I caught the virus on the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for 14 days, at the end of a 16-day cruise I took with my wife, Jeri. When I left the ship a couple of weeks ago, I felt fine. We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine. Jeri and I got a swab test for the virus. Our temperatures were normal; they'd get the swab results back in 48 hours. Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport, where two U.S. government planes waited for us.  As we took off from Tokyo, I had a bit of a cough, but I chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin. I felt pretty tired - but who wouldn't, in our situation? I dozed off.  When I woke up, I had a fever. I made my way to the back of the cargo plane, where the Air Force had set up a quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic. They took my temperature. It was over 103 degrees. So I took a seat in the quarantine area and fell back asleep until we touched down in California, at Travis Air Force Base.  Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came onto the plane and said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha (with our spouses, if they wanted to come along). The CDC had a quarantine location at the University of Nebraska's hospital. We arrived on Feb. 17, greeted by a fleet of ambulances and police cars. Officials put me on a stretcher...</description>

      <title>Independents outnumber registered Republicans for first time...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/For-the-first-time-there-are-fewer-registered-15093062.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time in history, there are more registered independents in the United States than there are registered Republicans.  It may not be for the reason you think, though.  New data from Ballot Access News, which tracks registrations in the 31 states that require voters to register by party, show that independents now account for 29.09 percent of voters in them, compared to 28.87 percent for Republicans. As recently as 2004, Republicans outpaced independents by nearly 10 percentage points.  There are still way more registered Democrats; 39.66 percent are registered with that party.  This marks the first time since party registration began in the early 1900s that the number of registered independents in the United States has surpassed either major political party, according to Ballot Access News.  But before anybody chalks this up as having to do with the current occupant of the White House, it's worth parsing the trends.  While independents have surpassed Republicans, there actually hasn't been a huge drop in GOP party registration since Donald Trump took office. Since October 2016, GOP registration has dropped by half a percentage point. Democrats have actually declined by nearly a full point over the same span. Independents have benefited from both drops.  And they have been doing so for years. Democrats are more than three points off their peak this century, which was in 2008 when Barack Obama was about to become president. At the time, 43.62 percent of voters were registered Democrats.  Republicans are also more than three points off where they were four years earlier, in 2004, when 32.79 percent of voters were Republicans and George W. Bush won reelection.  Since 2008, the trendline for each party has been relatively steady. But while Democratic registrations fell...</description>
