      <title>Personal loans surging. Economic red flag...</title>
      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/business/article/Personal-loans-are-growing-like-a-weed-a-14852251.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Americans are hungry for personal loans that they can use as quick cash to pay for anything from vacations to credit card debt, a potential red flag for the economy.  Personal loans are up more than 10% from a year ago, according to data from Equifax, a rapid pace of growth that has not been seen on a sustained basis since shortly before the Great Recession. All three of the major consumer credit agencies -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- report double-digit growth in this market in recent months.  Experts are surprised to see millions of Americans taking on so much personal loan debt at a time when the economy looks healthy and paychecks are growing for many workers, raising questions about why so many people are seeking an extra infusion of cash.  "Definitely yellow flares should be starting to go off," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which monitors consumer credit. "There's an old adage in banking: if it's growing like a weed, it probably is a weed."  Personal loans are unsecured debt, meaning there is no underlying asset like a home or car that backs the loan if someone cannot repay. The average personal loan balance is now $16,259, according to Experian, a level that is similar to credit card debt.  Personal loan balances over $30,000 have jumped 15% in the past five years, Experian found. The trend comes as U.S. consumer debt has reached record levels, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The rapid growth in personal loans in recent years has coincided with a FinTech explosion of apps and websites that have made obtaining these loans an easy process that can be done from the comfort of the living room couch. FinTech companies now account for nearly 40% of personal loan balances, up from just 5% in 2013, according to...</description>

      <title>New generation of elite quarterbacks arrives just in time to save NFL?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/A-new-generation-of-elite-quarterbacks-arrived-14854547.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the NFL's current superstar quarterbacks, this is the definitive torch-passing season. That's how we should expect history to judge it. Twenty years from now, we will look back and cite 2019 as the year in which one immensely persistent, accomplished and deep era of QBs finally yielded the floor to a transformative new collection of signal callers.  If you're paying attention, this season keeps making the shift indisputably clear. Let's start with an exciting MVP race, led by Russell Wilson and Lamar Jackson with Deshaun Watson just on the outskirts of the discussion. They're putting on dazzling displays, racking up ridiculous stats and collecting the wins necessary to win the coveted award. But more than that, the way they play and their impact on success is allowing us to have a richer conversation about their value and contributions.  The NFL MVP may always be a quarterback's award; over the past 12 seasons, Adrian Peterson (2012) is the only non-QB to win it. But there is more nuance to this race, however, than simply asking which traditional ol' dropback quarterbacks on good teams are playing well. To appreciate the greatness of these candidates, you can look into how their teams are built around them, how they influence the running and passing games and how they each approach the position differently. They also happen to be African American, and if you include the prolific play of Dak Prescott (leading the NFL with 3,221 passing yards), the consistent wow factor of reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes and the solid first season of No. 1 pick Kyler Murray, there has never been this many black quarterbacks receiving this much acclaim at once. The social significance matters, but it's even bigger than race. No matter the color of the quarterback's skin, the stodgy NFL is adapting better to the evolution of its athletes...</description>

      <title>In Iran, 'rage escalating' as economic stress reaches new level...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/In-Iran-rage-is-escalating-as-economic-stress-14854473.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ISTANBUL - A sudden move to raise fuel prices in Iran has sparked nationwide protests over the past week and, in turn, drawn a fierce crackdown by security forces, marking some of the worst violence in the country in years. Scores have been reported killed.  The protests have flared in many of the same areas that experienced unrest two years ago, when demonstrators protested a similar proposal to slash state subsidies. Then, as now, lower-income Iranians rose up against a system that they said had failed them economically.  But a wider spectrum of society may have joined the revolt this time around, analysts say, pointing to demonstrations in major cities and at universities, including the University of Tehran. Protesters have also clashed with police in urban centers such as Isfahan, Mashhad, Shiraz and Tabriz.  Over the past two years, Iran's economy has worsened because of U.S. sanctions and declining oil sales - revenue the government uses to pay salaries and fund imports. Iran's economy is expected to contract by 8.7 percent this year, according to the World Bank.  The soaring inflation and stagnating wages have deepened Iranians' malaise and frustration. But the dismal state of affairs also appears to have lit a fire.  In recent days, demonstrators angered by the fuel price hike have confronted security forces in at least 100 locations, surpassing the previous protests in ferocity and geographic scale. They burned banks and police stations, ransacked government buildings, and blocked roads. Riot police responded with tear gas, water cannons and live fire, rights groups said. More than 100 demonstrators may have been killed, according to Amnesty International.  "The common thread between the 2017-2018 protests and those taking place today is the sense among many Iranians that the economy favors entrenched interests...</description>

      <link>https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Bloomberg-files-campaign-paperwork-no-decision-14852598.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.nhregister.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) - New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg has taken another step toward launching a Democratic bid for president.  The former New York City mayor, who became a Democrat just last year, filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday to formally create a presidential campaign committee. The move legally allows him to begin raising and spending money on a 2020 campaign, although his team says he's yet to make a final decision.  A formal announcement is expected in the coming days.  The 77-year-old Bloomberg is one of the richest people in the world. His estimated net worth exceeds $50 billion, and he's already committed to spending more than $100 million to help defeat President Donald Trump in 2020 whether he runs or not.  Bloomberg's enormous wealth, his ties to Wall Street, and his status as a former Republican could make it difficult for him to win support among traditional Democratic primary voters. Should he run, his advisers have charted an unconventional strategy that calls for him to bypass the first four states on the primary calendar and make an aggressive play for the so-called Super Tuesday states that vote in early March.  Before Thursday's federal filing, he had already filed paperwork to qualify for presidential primary ballots in three states.  Bloomberg's team says he's stepping toward a run because of the perceived weakness at the top of the current Democratic field, particularly in establishment-favorite former Vice President Joe Biden's candidacy.</description>
