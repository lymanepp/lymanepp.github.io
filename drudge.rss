      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sun-sentinel.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A mission to bust criminal activity in massage parlors across Florida turned into a monumental legal victory for Super Bowl champion owner Robert Kraft. The billionaire's lawyers successfully argued that the sneak-and-peek warrant allowing the covert surveillance was an unlawful invasion of privacy. Legal observers who watched the prostitution case unravel say the sting was doomed from the start.</description>

      <title>No Mueller, No McGahn: Fuming Dems Plot 'Extreme Measures'...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/No-Mueller-no-McGahn-and-stalled-investigations-13854965.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - An increasing number of House Democrats are frustrated by their stalled investigations into President Donald Trump, with an uncooperative chief executive, their own leader's reluctance about impeachment and courts that could be slow to resolve the standoff.  Democrats have yet to hear from special counsel Robert Mueller III, who led the nearly two-year investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election and possible involvement with the Trump campaign. Even with negotiations, the earliest Mueller could testify would be next month.  And any hopes of former White house counsel Donald McGahn facing a congressional panel on Tuesday are slim, as the White House moves to block all current and former aides from cooperating with congressional inquiries.  Weighing all options, Democrats have raised the specter of imposing fines or jailing people who ignore subpoenas, extreme measures that have prompted some legal experts to wonder whether Democrats have a strategy for this constitutional conflict.  A group of House Judiciary Committee Democrats privately have discussed ways to increase pressure on leadership to being impeachment proceedings despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's wariness, according to several Democrats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the plan.  "There's no doubt in my mind that we are all going to come to a point [where more has to be done] - including the speaker," said Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, a senior Democrat. "We respect her leadership and we respect her strategic sense about how these things work, her political sense. But I think we're all getting to a point where we know something more has to be done."  The anxious search for next steps comes as Pelosi, D-Calif., has settled on a long-game approach and most Democrats have fallen in line. She has argued that...</description>

      <title>Did Judges Ignore Occupation of Journalist Who Had Home Raided By Cops?</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/Motion-Aims-To-Find-Out-If-Judges-Knew-Or-Ignored-13852762.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (BCN)  A free-speech advocacy group filed a motion in San Francisco Superior Court Thursday to unseal applications for search warrants obtained by police before they raided the home and office of a journalist last week.  Freelance stringer Bryan Carmody's home and office were raided May 10 in connection with an investigation into a leaked police report on the February death of San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi.  According to the San Rafael-based First Amendment Coalition, they filed the motion on behalf of Carmody and with help from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Northern California chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.  The motion is set to be heard Tuesday morning at the Hall of Justice in Department 22.  Leaders of the coalition said the search warrants in this case should already be public because the warrants were executed.  In a statement, coalition executive director David Snyder said, "Our motion to unseal aims to answer one of the most disturbing mysteries of this case-how two judges separately issued warrants that allowed police to raid the home of a working journalist in order to reveal that journalist's source.  "This obvious and unlawful intrusion on press rights demands accountability and accountability starts with knowing the facts," Snyder said.  Coalition leaders said that in order for police to get a search warrant to seize property police must show that it's likely stolen or embezzled property will be found at the location.  In making their case to a judge, police should have told the judge that Carmody is a working journalist and the warrant should not have issued.  According to the coalition, the California Shield Law generally prevents...</description>
