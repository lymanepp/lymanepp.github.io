      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have the coronavirus. And it hasn't been that bad.  I am in my late 60s, and the sickest I've ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out on my back for a few days. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don't have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual.  I caught the virus on the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for 14 days, at the end of a 16-day cruise I took with my wife, Jeri. When I left the ship a couple of weeks ago, I felt fine. We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine. Jeri and I got a swab test for the virus. Our temperatures were normal; they'd get the swab results back in 48 hours. Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport, where two U.S. government planes waited for us.  As we took off from Tokyo, I had a bit of a cough, but I chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin. I felt pretty tired - but who wouldn't, in our situation? I dozed off.  When I woke up, I had a fever. I made my way to the back of the cargo plane, where the Air Force had set up a quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic. They took my temperature. It was over 103 degrees. So I took a seat in the quarantine area and fell back asleep until we touched down in California, at Travis Air Force Base.  Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came onto the plane and said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha (with our spouses, if they wanted to come along). The CDC had a quarantine location at the University of Nebraska's hospital. We arrived on Feb. 17, greeted by a fleet of ambulances and police cars. Officials put me on a stretcher...</description>

      <title>Independents outnumber registered Republicans for first time...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/For-the-first-time-there-are-fewer-registered-15093062.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time in history, there are more registered independents in the United States than there are registered Republicans.  It may not be for the reason you think, though.  New data from Ballot Access News, which tracks registrations in the 31 states that require voters to register by party, show that independents now account for 29.09 percent of voters in them, compared to 28.87 percent for Republicans. As recently as 2004, Republicans outpaced independents by nearly 10 percentage points.  There are still way more registered Democrats; 39.66 percent are registered with that party.  This marks the first time since party registration began in the early 1900s that the number of registered independents in the United States has surpassed either major political party, according to Ballot Access News.  But before anybody chalks this up as having to do with the current occupant of the White House, it's worth parsing the trends.  While independents have surpassed Republicans, there actually hasn't been a huge drop in GOP party registration since Donald Trump took office. Since October 2016, GOP registration has dropped by half a percentage point. Democrats have actually declined by nearly a full point over the same span. Independents have benefited from both drops.  And they have been doing so for years. Democrats are more than three points off their peak this century, which was in 2008 when Barack Obama was about to become president. At the time, 43.62 percent of voters were registered Democrats.  Republicans are also more than three points off where they were four years earlier, in 2004, when 32.79 percent of voters were Republicans and George W. Bush won reelection.  Since 2008, the trendline for each party has been relatively steady. But while Democratic registrations fell...</description>

      <title>ROUBINI forecasts 40% drop...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/899110/stock-markets-are-headed-40-percent-plunge-says-economist-who-predicted-financial-crisis</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The end of a very rough week for U.S. markets brought a worrying prediction. While one expert warned fallout from the global coronavirus outbreak could be 'worse than the financial crisis' of 2008, the economist who correctly predicted that very crisis is now saying the idea of a major global recession 'doesn't sound too farfetched.' Nouriel Roubini, a New York University business professor and market prognosticator who foretold the housing bubble burst, told Yahoo Finance on Friday to expect 'severe' consequences as the coronavirus continues to rattle markets. How severe? He told Der Spiegel it could be worse than investors even believe at this point, predicting 'global equities to tank by 30 to 40 percent this year.' He said people 'prefer to believe in miracles,' (not necessarily referencing President Trump's prediction the coronavirus will 'disappear ... like a miracle,') and don't realize the 'simple math' tells us that realistically, a squeezed Chinese economy will mean downturns around the globe. 'This crisis will spill over and result in a disaster,' said Roubini. Roubini, who is often nicknamed Dr. Doom for his frequent pessimistic predictions, also saw doom and gloom for Trump's future as president as a result of any economic strife. Asked by Der Spiegel, Roubini said Trump would likely try to benefit politically from the outbreak, but 'will lose the election, that's for sure.' Pointing to past incumbent presidents getting ousted amid geopolitical tensions that damaged the economy, he said 'The Democratic field is poor, but Trump is dead. Quote me on that!' Though the week just saw a 3,500-point drop for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Roubini warned: 'It is far from being over.' Read more at Der Spiegel. Summer Meza</description>

      <title>Trump faces growing crisis...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/898838/new-yorker-wordlessly-sums-trumps-coronavirus-problem</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years, experts have warned that President Trump 'has been squandering the credibility he could need in a moment of national emergency, like a terrorist attack or a public health crisis,' Annie Karni, Michael Crowley, and Maggie Haberman write at The New York Times. And if the COVID-19 outbreak proves to be that moment, 'his history of issuing false claims could make it harder to sell the public on any plans to address coronavirus.' Trump has already 'made inaccurate or questionable claims' about the new virus, the Times notes. 'Current Trump allies said the fact that the president chose to address the growing public health crisis quickly after returning from a trip to India showed how seriously he was taking the outbreak. But privately, they say he has been reluctant to give in to what he has called an 'alarmist' view of the virus's potential to cause damage as he warily watches the effect of the outbreak on the stock market.' The new cover of The New Yorker makes a similar point more succinctly, suggesting his self-restricted vision is hampering America's response: An early look at next weekâ€™s cover, â€œUnder Control,â€� by Brian Stauffer: https://t.co/jbWDbmDyRl pic.twitter.com/mBpv1VYMsX â€” The New Yorker (@NewYorker) February 27, 2020 For what it's worth, epidemiology experts say the best thing for Americans to do right now is stay calm and not panic about the coronavirus, The Washington Post reports, as well as wash your hands regularly, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and stay home if you're feeling sick. But 'those surgical masks? If you're not sick, you don't need to wear them,' the Post adds. 'The main point of the mask is to keep someone who is infected with the virus from spreading it to others,' says Timothy Brewer, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health. You can relate that to the New Yorker cover at your leisure. Peter Weber</description>
