      <description>&lt;b&gt;ktla.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a September day last year, between the Jewish High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, a group of worshipers gathered in a parking lot at the Woodland Hills Hebrew Discovery Center for a religious ritual called kapparot.

      <title>Dems divided on path forward... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Democrats-second-guess-calling-Mueller-divided-14152728.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - House Democrats are struggling to figure out their next move against President Donald Trump after their highly anticipated hearing with Robert Mueller III fell flat, forcing some Democrats to second-guess their strategy while aggravating divisions in the party over impeachment.  Several centrist Democrats seized on the absence of a major revelation to argue it was time to end House investigations into whether Trump tried to obstruct the former special counsel's probe and pivot to legislation.  "Anyone who was looking for the smoking gun yesterday didn't get it," said Rep. Anthony Brindisi, D-N.Y., who ousted a Republican incumbent by fewer than 500 votes in last year's midterm elections. "It's time to move on and focus on getting some bills passed here that can get signed into law."  But that plea had no effect on the pro-impeachment Democrats, who dug in, insisting that House oversight of Trump and his administration has been ineffective and pressed for launching proceedings.  In a closed-door caucus meeting Wednesday night, after Mueller's testimony, proponents tried to convince House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to move ahead on impeachment, a step she has resisted.  "There's no question that if we're serious about accountability, we put our strongest foot forward to get information and enforce subpoenas to shape this narrative," said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., who complained that the House's current strategy was a "slow-walk."  He said it was a mistake for Democrats to rely on Mueller - a 74-year-old reluctant witness who had made clear that he would not provide the blockbuster moment the party craved - to make their case to the public.  "We are not potted plants. We can actually shape some of this public sentiment," Huffman said. "We're not...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Facebook-co-founder-campaigning-to-break-up-tech-14149729.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN FRANCISCO - Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has become one of the company's biggest problems.  In recent weeks, Hughes, who left the social media giant in 2007 and cashed out his nearly $500 million worth of stock, has been making the rounds in the nation's capital, visiting a dozen lawmakers and regulators at the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies which are all interested in examining whether Facebook has amassed too much power. He's talked with the attorney general of New York.  In those meetings, which he sometimes attended on his own, he has presented a 39-page slide deck that makes a point-by-point legal case for breaking up the social network drawing on decades of antitrust law precedent.  The crux of the case, designed with the help of two antitrust scholars: Facebook's wealth and power and massive user base have pushed it into monopoly territory, and its acquisitions of rivals have squashed competition. More than 2.7 billion people use Facebook or its other platforms, which include Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp, at least once a month, Facebook said Wednesday.  "I hope that my speaking out provides cover to a lot of other folks, whether former employees or current ones, to express ambivalence or concern about what's going on," Hughes said in an interview Thursday. "And I think there's a lot to be concerned about."  Hughes, who helped develop the social media giant with Mark Zuckerberg in their Harvard University dorm, has become a critical weapon to trust busters in a fight that keeps expanding in scope, threatening tech giants including Amazon, Apple and Google with potential new regulation or even a breakup. Just this week, the Justice Department said it was launching a new, expanded probe targeting "market-leading online platforms," And on Wednesday, Facebook...</description>

      <title>IRS turned over Nixon's tax returns same day congressional panel asked for them...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/IRS-turned-over-Nixon-s-tax-returns-same-day-that-14146359.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Internal Revenue Service turned President Richard Nixon's tax returns over to a congressional committee the same day in 1973 that the panel requested them for a review, according to letters released by House Democrats on Thursday.  The newly released documents appear to contradict the Trump administration's claims that House Democrats' demands for the president's tax returns are "unprecedented," and suggest a split between this administration and prior IRS officials over the interpretation of the law.  On Dec. 13, 1973, Laurence Woodworth of the Joint Committee on Taxation asked the commissioner of the IRS to review Nixon's tax returns from 1969 through 1972, according to the documents. Nixon had asked the congressional committee to review the documents amid the widening Watergate scandal.  In a letter to the committee also dated Dec. 13, 1973, IRS Commissioner Donald Alexander said that enclosed in his response were attachments of "true copies of the original joint federal income tax returns filed by Richard M. and Patricia R. Nixon" for the years requested.  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., has requested six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns, from 2013 to 2018, a period that includes several years before Trump became president.  Neal recently sued the Trump administration in federal court to obtain the records, after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin argued in a May letter that Neal's "unprecedented request" should be denied.  The Ways and Means Committee voted in executive session to make the documents public. In a memo sent Thursday to other members of the committee, Neal said the letters confirm his interpretation of code section 6103, which pertains to congressional requests for private taxpayer information.  "Section...</description>

      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/In-the-Philippines-content-moderators-at-14130284.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MANILA, Philippines - A year after quitting his job reviewing some of the most gruesome content the internet has to offer, Lester prays every week that the images he saw can be erased from his mind.  First as a contractor for YouTube and then for Twitter, he worked on a high-up floor of a mall in this traffic-clogged Asian capital, where he spent up to nine hours each day weighing questions about the details in those images. He made decisions about whether a child's genitals were being touched accidentally or on purpose, or whether a knife slashing someone's neck depicted a real-life killing - and if such content should be allowed online.  He's still haunted by what he saw. Today, entering a tall building triggers flashbacks to the suicides he reviewed, causing him to entertain the possibility of jumping. At night, he Googles footage of bestiality and incest - material he was never exposed to before but now is ashamed that he is drawn to. For the last year, he has visited a mall chapel every week, where he works with a church brother to ask God to "white out" those images from his memory.  "I know it's not normal, but now everything is normalized," said the 33-year-old, using only his first name because of a confidentiality agreement he signed when he took the job.  Workers such as Lester are on the front lines of the never-ending battle to keep the internet safe. But thousands of miles separate the Philippines and Silicon Valley, rendering these workers vulnerable to exploitation by some of the world's tech giants.  In the last couple of years, social media companies have created tens of thousands of jobs around the world to vet and delete violent or offensive content, attempting to shore up their reputations after failing to adequately police content including live-streamed terrorist attacks and Russian disinformation...</description>
