      <title>Baristas beware: Robot that makes gourmet cups of coffee has arrived...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Baristas-beware-A-robot-that-makes-gourmet-cups-13708775.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the food industry, it seems, the robot revolution is well underway, with machines mastering skilled tasks that have always been performed by people.  In Boston, robots have replaced chefs and are creating complex bowls of food for customers. In Prague, machines are displacing bartenders and servers using an app. In Denver, they're taking orders at a fast food drive through.  Robots are even making the perfect loaf of bread these days, taking charge of an art that has remained in human hands for thousands of years.  Now comes Briggo, a company that has created a fully automated, robotic brewing machine that that can push out 100 cups of coffee in a single hour -- equaling the output of three to four baristas, according to the company.  Using a blend of Latin American beans, the machine -- known as a "coffee haus" -- creates customized cups of gourmet coffee that can be ordered via an app, giving customers control over ingredients, espresso shots, flavorings and temperature without any human interaction. The company says no other business in the world has applied as much technology to "specialty coffee."  Removing the human element from ordering a cup of coffee is one of the company's primary selling points.  "No more lines, no more counter confusion, no more misspelled names," Briggo's website says, flicking at human failings.  Briggo said all eight of its machines are owned by the company, but they've recently begun offering a licensed business model to prospective operators. The company didn't reveal how much that business model costs, but noted that rent and revenue-sharing arrangements are typical when a machine is placed in a public location, such as an airport.  Kevin Nater, Briggo's president and chief executive, said the machine would thrive in locations in which...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Special counsel Robert Mueller submitted a long-awaited report to Attorney General William Barr on Friday, marking the end of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.  The submission of Mueller's report ends his closely watched inquiry - a case that has engulfed the Trump administration since its inception, leading to criminal charges against 34 people, including six former Trump associates and advisers.  A senior Justice Department official said the special counsel has not recommended any further indictments - a revelation that buoyed Trump's supporters, even as other Trump-related investigations continue in other parts of the Justice Department. It is also unclear whether a Mueller report that does not result in additional charges could still hurt the president politically.  Justice Department officials notified Congress late Friday that they had received Mueller's report, but they did not describe its contents. Barr is expected to summarize the findings for lawmakers as early as this weekend.  Only a small number of people inside the Justice Department know the document's contents, but it immediately sparked a furious political reaction, with Democrats vying for the presidential nomination in 2020 demanding a public release of the findings and the two top Democrats in Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling for the full report and its "underlying documentation" to be provided to Congress.  Trump's supporters viewed the news as an optimistic indication that he was on the cusp of being vindicated.  "The fact that there are no more indictments is a big deal," said David Bossie, a Trump ally. "This president has had his entire two-year presidency under a...</description>
