      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.latimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly six months after President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un embraced at a historic Singapore summit and made vague promises of peace and prosperity, talks have flatlined and Pyongyang has taken no significant steps to reduce its nuclear arsenal or capabilities.</description>

      <link>https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Trump-Individual-1-is-newly-cast-as-center-of-13432906.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.houstonchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In two major developments this week, President Donald Trump has been labeled in the parlance of criminal investigations as a major subject of interest, complete with an opaque legal code name: "Individual 1." New evidence from two separate fronts of special counsel Robert Mueller III's investigation casts fresh doubts on Trump's version of key events involving Russia, signaling potential political and legal peril for the president. Investigators have now publicly cast Trump as a central figure of their probe into whether Trump's campaign conspired with the Russian government during the 2016 campaign.</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Inside-a-futuristic-restaurant-where-a-robot-has-13432560.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With architecture dating back to the Middle Ages, Prague is a city whose modern identity is still defined by its many layers of ancient history, much of which remains gloriously intact. And yet, it is here - among a city of Baroque palaces, ornate, Renaissance-era chapels and cobblestone streets - that one of the first flashes of the future has suddenly, randomly emerged. It has been dubbed "Cyberdog." Though the name conjures images of an Eastern European Internet Cafe frequented by backpackers, it actually belongs to a newly opened wine bar. Unlike other wine bars in the Czech capital, however, this one has a new twist: It is staffed by a robotic bartender who serves drinks ordered via a smartphone app, according to Reuters.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN DIEGO (AP) — No criminal charges will be filed against any of the 42 people associated with a caravan of Central American migrants who were arrested in a clash that ended with U.S. authorities firing tear gas into Mexico, The Associated Press has learned. The decision not to prosecute comes despite President Donald Trump's vow that the U.S. will not tolerate lawlessness and extensive preparations for the caravan, which included deployment of thousands of active-duty troops to the border. Rodney Scott, chief of the Border Patrol's San Diego sector, has said those arrested for illegal entry included 27 men, with the rest being women and children.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) — Officials say a teen has been freed after spending more than three hours in the vault of an abandoned Florida bank. News outlets report that Hollywood firefighters tried to drill through a wall to break into the vault Wednesday afternoon after the 17-year-old's friend called 911. But they were stymied until a worker at the bank's new branch across the street heard of the predicament. That worker remembered the code and was able to open the vault's massive door.</description>

Chinese Vice Minister of Science and Technology Xu Nanping told state broadcaster CCTV that his ministry is strongly opposed to the efforts that reportedly produced twin girls born earlier this month.

Police Lt. Col. Kemchat Paedkaew says the accident occurred at dusk Wednesday on a small road that has signs telling drivers to beware of wild animals that sometimes stray from Khao Yai National Park. He said the driver was not from the area and failed to slow down when he encountered the elephant. When the vehicle struck the elephant's back legs, the animal responded by stomping on the car, destroying the engine and killing the driver.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Suicides and drug overdoses pushed up U.S. deaths last year, and drove a continuing decline in how long Americans are expected to live. Overall, there were more than 2.8 million U.S. deaths in 2017, or nearly 70,000 more than the previous year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. It was the most deaths in a single year since the government began counting more than a century ago. The increase partly reflects the nation's growing and aging population. But it's deaths in younger age groups — particularly middle-aged people — that have had the largest impact on calculations of life expectancy, experts said.</description>

What he didn't know is that Tesla constantly sends information about the precise location of his car to the Chinese government. Tesla is not alone. China has called upon all electric vehicle manufacturers in China to make the same kind of reports — potentially adding to the rich kit of surveillance tools available to the Chinese government as President Xi Jinping steps up the use of technology to track Chinese citizens.</description>
