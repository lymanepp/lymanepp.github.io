      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARIS (AP) — The crooked tennis players knew him as "Maestro." To European investigators, the Armenian based in Belgium is emerging as something else: The suspected ringleader of an organized gambling syndicate suspected of fixing hundreds of matches and corrupting more than 100 players from around Europe. As Roger Federer and other stars at the top of tennis compete in the Australian Open, players far lower down the sport's food chain are being questioned this week by police in France on suspicion of fixing matches for the Maestro, himself in detention in Belgium.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A legislative proposal in Connecticut would mandate instruction on climate change in public schools statewide, beginning in elementary school. Connecticut already has adopted science standards that call for teaching of climate change, but if the bill passes it is believed that it would be the country's first to write such a requirement into law. "A lot of schools make the study of climate change an elective, and I don't believe it should be an elective," said state Rep. Christine Palm, a Democrat from Chester who proposed the bill. "I think it should be mandatory, and I think it should be early so there's no excuse for kids to grow up ignorant of what's at stake."</description>

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez "was so fiscally irresponsible that she hadn't saved up enough money to rent an apartment in the Washington D.C. area," wrote conservative commentator Candace Owens, adding the hashtag #SocialismSucks, as she blasted the New York freshman for complaining that some members of Congress have trouble paying for two residences. "But sure, let's trust her with the future fiscal-planning of America." Ever since she burst onto the national political scene as a socialist Democrat with a knack for making headlines, Ocasio-Cortez has been an obsession for many on the political right.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Shutdown pressure on President Donald Trump mounted Wednesday as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on him to delay his State of the Union address and his own economists acknowledged the prolonged standoff was having a greater economic drag than previously thought. In a letter to Trump, Pelosi cited security concerns, noting that both the Secret Service and the Homeland Security Department are affected by the partial government shutdown, now it its fourth week. She added that unless the government reopens this week, they should find another date or Trump should deliver the address in writing.</description>

Congress passed a declaration Tuesday declaring Maduro's rulings invalid and giving amnesty to members of the military who help return Venezuela to democratic rule. Maduro has cultivated a stronghold within the military even as Venezuela collapses in a historic economic and political crisis.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa (all times local): 7:20 p.m. The House has approved a Democratic measure disapproving of Republican Rep. Steve King's comments about white supremacy. The nine-term Iowa congressman was among those supporting the measure, which was approved, 424-1. King says he agrees with South Carolina Democratic Rep. James Clyburn, the resolution's sponsor, that white supremacy is an evil that cannot be ignored. King's racist comments have been widely condemned by members of both parties in recent days. King says the ideology of white supremacy "never shows up in my head" and that he does "not know how it could possibly come out of my mouth." Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois opposed the measure, saying the House should take the more serious step of censuring King for his "repugnant and racist behavior." Last week, King said in an interview, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service is recalling about 46,000 of its employees furloughed by the government shutdown — nearly 60 percent of its workforce — to handle tax returns and pay out refunds. The employees won't be paid during the shutdown. With the official start of the tax filing season coming Jan. 28, the Trump administration has promised that taxpayers owed refunds will be paid on time, despite the disruption in government services caused by the partial shutdown now in its fourth week.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;EL PASO, Texas - In a digital ad that recently went viral, Beto O'Rourke tore into President Donald Trump's desired border wall with soaring footage of the Rio Grande Valley and an explanation of what the wall would do: cut off access to the river, shrink the size of the United States and force the seizure of privately-held land. It noted that most undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States in the past decade came not over the border but on visas that then expired. So what should be done to address visa overstays? "I don't know," O'Rourke said, pausing in a lengthy interview.</description>
