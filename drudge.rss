      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Whatever success Republicans have amassed in taking control of all three branches of U.S. government, and whatever fate awaits them as midterm elections near, some on the right are working to cement change by amending the Constitution.

While opponents are afraid of what such a convention would do, supporters say it is the only way to deal with the federal government's overreach and ineptitude.</description>

Data through Thursday from the secretary of state includes counties that are home to nearly 80 percent of Texas' population. That's compared to the 4.7 million-plus total ballots cast in 2014's top-of-the-ballot Texas governor's race.</description>
