      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.studyfinds.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK — From credit card payments to student loans, debt is an inconvenient fact of life for many Americans. Despite being so common, many people feel the need to hide their outstanding debts from potential partners and love interests, according to a new survey of 2,000 U.S. adults.

      <title>BALZ: For Dems, and for Republicans, a summer of discontent...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/For-Democrats-and-for-Republicans-a-summer-of-14278190.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has been a rough week for Republicans and for Democrats. As the long August recess begins, these are not happy times for either political party.  The Democratic presidential candidates put on two nights of debating in Detroit, producing maximum internal bickering and negativity and minimal positive or outward messaging to voters who will decide the 2020 election.  On the first night, the ideological split within the party broke wide open. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the two most left-leaning candidates on the stage, dominated their less-liberal rivals.  On the second night, the Democrats turned on one another, rather than President Donald Trump, and did so in smaller and less substantive ways than their colleagues on night one. Former Vice President Joe Biden bore the brunt of the attacks, though he was not alone. In the process, even former President Barack Obama took it on the chin at times.  Tuesday's session sparked a useful debate about what a post-Obama party should stand for and look like to attract as many voters as possible. But it raised obvious concerns about whether Democrats are veering too far to the left to win a general election against Trump. Wednesday session somehow managed to diminish virtually everyone onstage but didn't much change the nomination contest.  But presidential candidates aren't the only Democrats who are squabbling with one another. House Democrats, who should still be flush with the victory they engineered in the midterm election last November, are split down the middle over the biggest issue before them.  Should they start an impeachment inquiry against the president, as half their caucus now favors? Or, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., prefers, should they hold back indefinitely, or at least until they have more public support and more grounds...</description>

      <title>Dozens Storm Gates At Lollapalooza...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stereogum.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The kids love storming things these days — watch out, Area 51! — and yesterday, it was Lollapalooza's turn. Dozens of aspiring festivalgoers stormed the gates at Lollapalooza, hopping over the fence en masse. According to footage posted online, the cops guarding the festival only managed to stop one guy with a prosthetic leg, which doesn't even seem fair. Over 100 people just stormed the fence at Lollapalooza… one guy got caught. 😂 pic.twitter.com/4igQeBA4Kb— Armand*s Milk (@nucklehead103) August 2, 2019 Nonetheless, officials claim that no one actually managed to storm their way into the festival: "Statement re: the attempted breach of an exterior perimeter fence at Lolla today. Our robust security plan, which includes multiple layers of fences worked. No one gained entry. Note to anyone who's thinking about trying it: offenders will be charged with criminal trespass." Multiple fences? What is this sorcery? Statement re: the attempted breach of an exterior perimeter</description>

      <title>Paramount and paranoid: China's Xi faces crisis of confidence...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Paramount-and-paranoid-China-s-Xi-faces-a-crisis-14278079.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHANGHAI - Chinese scholars and Communist Party cadres have a succinct way of describing the tectonic shifts taking place here: Deng Xiaoping made us rich, now Xi Jinping is making us strong.  The phrase sums up China's economic rise that began under Deng four decades ago, and the hopes for a similarly significant geopolitical realignment under the current president.  Xi has devoted his seven years in power to strengthening the ruling Communist Party, and by extension the country. He has relentlessly quashed dissent, sidelined rivals and demanded absolute loyalty.  After pledging to make the party "north, south, east and west," he has ensured that it is paramount not just in policymaking but in the military, business, education and the law.  Now, Xi is facing challenges on multiple fronts and the Communist Party, riven with paranoia at the best of times, is seeing threats at every turn.  He has to contend not just with a slowing economy but also a protracted trade war with the United States, that has entered a new confrontational phase with President Donald Trump's decision to impose more tariffs next month.  He is facing escalating Western criticism of Chinese policies toward ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang, where as many as 3 million people have been put into reeducation camps. He is dealing with an increasingly assertive Taiwan at the same time as a pro-democracy movement swells in Hong Kong.  All of these loom as dangers to Xi's authority as the party's general secretary and are heightening a sense of alarm within a party long fearful of external threats.  "A strong party is the key to a successful China, in Xi's eyes. It is also the only way to fend off enemies abroad, most notably the U.S.," said Richard McGregor, an expert on the party and the author of a new book about...</description>
