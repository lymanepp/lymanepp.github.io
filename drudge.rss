      <title>PAPER:  Giuliani held phone call with Maduro amid crisis... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-s-lawyer-and-the-Venezuelan-president-How-14937863.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The international call came in September 2018, after months of rising tension between the United States and Venezuela, a key strategic player in South America.  On one end of the line was Venezuela's socialist president, the pariah leader of a disintegrating economy whom President Donald Trump's administration was seeking to isolate.  On the other end: the U.S. president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and then-Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas.  Both were part of a shadow diplomatic effort, backed in part by private interests, aimed at engineering a negotiated exit to ease President Nicolás Maduro from power and reopen resource-rich Venezuela to business, according to people familiar with the endeavor.  Sessions had served as emissary in the back-channel effort, visiting Maduro in Caracas that spring. The phone call, which Giuliani joined, was a follow-up to that visit, Sessions' spokesman Matt Mackowiak told The Washington Post.  The phone conversation involving the Venezuelan president and Trump's personal lawyer, which has not been previously reported, provides another example of how Giuliani used his private role to insert himself into foreign diplomacy, alarming administration officials confused about whose interests he was representing.  Giuliani operated a similar campaign this year in Ukraine, where he pressured officials to announce investigations to benefit Trump - an endeavor that led to the president's impeachment this month.  The impeachment inquiry pushed into the spotlight consulting work Giuliani has undertaken around the globe even as he has been representing Trump at no charge. His freelancing has triggered concerns among White House officials that his intercessions have muddied and at times undercut official U.S. policy, according to people familiar with...</description>

      <title>TWITTER blames 'outage' after Trump whistleblower tweet temporarily disappears...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-retweets-deletes-post-naming-alleged-14936572.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - President Donald Trump retweeted a post that included the alleged name of the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint ultimately led to Trump's impeachment by the House.  Just before midnight Friday, Trump retweeted a message from Twitter user @Surfermom77, an account that claims to be a woman named Sophia who lives in California. The account shows some indications of automation, including an unusually high amount of activity and profile pictures featuring stock images from the internet.  By Saturday morning, the post seemed to have disappeared on many users' feeds, suggesting Trump had deleted it, though it could still be found in other ways, including on a website that logs every presidential tweet.  The retweet then reappeared Saturday night. Twitter told The Associated Press that an outage with one of its systems caused tweets on some accounts, including Trump's, to be visible to some but not others.  Trump has repeatedly backed efforts to unmask the whistleblower. But his Friday night retweet marks the first time he has directly sent the alleged name into the Twitter feed of his 68 million followers.  Unmasking the whistleblower, who works in the intelligence field, could violate federal protection laws that have historically been supported by both parties.  The whistleblower filed a complaint in August about one of Trump's telephone conversations with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and other dealings with the Eastern European nation. The complaint prompted House Democrats to launch a probe that ended with Trump's impeachment earlier this month. The matter now heads to the Senate, where the Republican majority is expected to acquit the president.  The central points from the whistleblower's complaint were confirmed...</description>
