      <title>'CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER'</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Lawyer-for-Democrats-calls-President-Trump-a-14892874.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A lawyer for Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee called President Trump "a clear and present danger" as he summarized the party's case for impeaching him for having abused his power and obstructed a congressional investigation into his conduct in Urkaine.  The testimony from Daniel Goldman came amid a crucial hearing at which lawyers for both Democrats and Republicans are making cases for and against impeachment. Earlier, Stephen Castor, a lawyer for Republicans called impeachment "baloney" and said Democrats had failed to make a compelling case.  At the heart of the Democrats' case is the allegation that Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and military aid, sought by Ukraine to combat Russian military aggression, to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a probe of an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.  Goldman, the top investigative counsel for the House Intelligence Committee, summarized the Democratic case for impeachment in his presentation.  "We are here today because Donald J. Trump, the 45th president of the United States, abused the power of his office, the American presidency, for his political and personal benefit," Goldman said. "As part of this scheme, President Trump applied increasing pressure on the president of Ukraine to publicly announce two investigations helpful to his personal reelection efforts."  He later added: "When faced with the opening of an official impeachment inquiry into his conduct, President Trump launched an unprecedented campaign of obstruction of Congress - ordering executive branch agencies and government officials to defy subpoenas for...</description>

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Questions-keep-stacking-up-against-Patriots-and-14891882.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - Predicting the demise of the New England Patriots is a long-running parlor game that leaves no winners, only regret and fools. The onset of doom, for them, ends with trophies and parades, with Bill Belichick cracking his annual half-smile and Tom Brady somehow looking younger. Declaring the end of the Patriots is both pointless venture and folly.  But we also don't know what the end will look like, so we might not be able to identify it even when it happens in front of our eyes. What if the end looks like an impotent offense surrendering amid the strange sound of Gillette Stadium boos at halftime? What if it looks like Brady engulfed in the pocket and fuming on the sideline days after his father openly speculated in the local newspaper about his son's future? What if looks like undrafted rookie Jakobi Meyers running wide open across the middle and allowing a pinpoint pass to slip through his fingers? What if it looks like Brady sitting on his backside, a final pass having fluttered to the turf, as the visiting sideline erupts?  What if the end looks like Sunday evening?  The Patriots still hold a bye in the AFC playoffs, and they may yet win their seventh Super Bowl two months from now. If they do, they will think back to the first half of Sunday's 23-16 defeat and marvel at how they ever sailed so far ashore. In a rematch of last year's AFC championship game, the Kansas City Chiefs snapped the Patriots' 21-game home winning streak, playoffs included, and disabused anyone of the notion that the Patriots are presently a championship-caliber outfit.  The Patriots rebounded in the second half, and Brady threw a pass into the end zone with 1:06 left that could have given the Patriots a chance to tie or take the lead. If not for untimely officiating misadventures, New England may well have won. Then...</description>

      <title>Trump's defense of Kingdom grows more isolated...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Trump-s-defense-of-Saudis-grows-more-isolated-14891534.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - After a Saudi gunman killed three people at a naval base in Pensacola, Florida, some of President Donald Trump's Republican allies took to the airwaves to condemn the attack as an act of terrorism, call for a halt to the training program that admitted the shooter and sharply press the Saudi government to cooperate in the investigation.  Trump did none of that. Instead, he used his appearances before television cameras - and his Twitter account - to repeatedly offer cover for the Saudis, conveying Riyadh's condolences with more fervor than he used in relaying his personal feelings about the shooting.  "They are devastated in Saudi Arabia," Trump told reporters Saturday, unprompted. "And the King will be involved in taking care of families and loved ones. He feels very strongly. He's very, very devastated by what happened and what took place. Likewise, the Crown Prince. They are devastated by what took place in Pensacola."  Trump's defense of the Saudi government, which began just hours after Friday's shooting, steadily became a more isolated position over the weekend as more information trickled out about the gunman and other Saudi nationals who were receiving training at the base.  On Sunday, the FBI said it presumed the shooting was terrorism.  "We are, as we do in most active-shooter investigations, work with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism," said Rachel Rojas, special agent in charge of the FBI's Jacksonville division.  Earlier Sunday, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., normally a staunch Trump ally, was among several state officials pushing for more stringent scrutiny of foreigners who come to the United States for military training. Gaetz, who earlier called the killing an act of terrorism, also suggested the incident should change America's...</description>

      <title>RUDY IN THE SHADOWS</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Giuliani-carves-influencer-shadow-adviser-roles-14891683.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was on the phone in late 2018, pressing administration officials about his latest agenda item.  President Donald Trump had nominated a career Foreign Service officer to become the U.S. ambassador to Qatar, a key post in a Middle Eastern country with tricky regional relationships, an important U.S. military installation and vast oil reserves.  Giuliani, who has said he had held a cybersecurity contract with Qatar in 2017 and early 2018, proposed replacing her with someone he said would be a better fit - Scott Taylor, a Trump-supporting former congressman from Virginia defeated in his reelection bid in November 2018, according to people familiar with his outreach.  Giuliani's previously unreported attempts to shape the pick for the U.S. envoy to Qatar is part of an unorthodox foreign policy portfolio he has carved out for himself while also working as a power-broker-for-hire with direct access to the president and top administration officials.  The dual roles he has embraced is part of what longtime colleagues say has been a transformation of the once-iconic New York mayor into a multimillionaire consultant to powerful figures overseas.  In the three years since Trump took office, Giuliani has expanded his lucrative foreign consulting and legal practice, taking on clients that span the globe, from Turkey to Venezuela to Romania to Ukraine.  Along the way, he also has used his singular perch to try to influence U.S. policy and criminal investigations - at times pushing the interests of foreign figures who could benefit him financially.  In 2017, Giuliani tried to get Trump and top Cabinet members to make moves sought by Turkey while working as a lawyer for a gold trader from that country with ties to top government...</description>
