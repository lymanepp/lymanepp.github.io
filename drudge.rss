      <title>Tracing Trump's Postal Service obsession  --  from 'loser' to 'scam' to 'rigged election'... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Tracing-Trump-s-Postal-Service-obsession-from-15486836.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Soon after taking office in 2017, President Donald Trump seized on the U.S. Postal Service as an emblem of the bloated bureaucracy. "A loser," he repeatedly labeled one of America's most beloved public institutions, according to aides who discussed the matter with him.  Allies coddled Trump by telling him the reason he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016 was widespread mail-in balloting fraud - a conspiracy theory for which there is no evidence - and the president's postal outrage coarsened further.  Then Trump complained to senior White House advisers that Jeff Bezos - a presidential foe in part because he owns The Washington Post, whose news coverage the president thought was unfair and too tough on him - was "getting rich" because Amazon had been "ripping off" the Postal Service with a "sweetheart deal" to ship millions of its packages, one of them recalled. They explained that this was not true and that the Postal Service actually benefited from Amazon's business, the adviser added, but the president railed for months about what he described as a "scam."  And now Trump has fixated again on the Postal Service, this time trying to make it a tool in his reelection campaign by slowing mail service, blocking an emergency infusion of federal funds and challenging the integrity of mail-in balloting. The president acknowledged last week that his opposition is rooted in his desire to restrict how many Americans can vote by mail.  The breathtaking moves by the Trump administration this summer to disrupt a Constitutionally mandated government service during the coronavirus pandemic - under the argument that it will boost operational efficiencies - represent the culmination of Trump's grievance-fueled crusade against the Postal Service that dates to the start of his presidency. Many of his complaints...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The United States Postal Service has warned that in Pennsylvania, some mail-in ballots may not be delivered in time to be counted this November. In a July letter to Pennsylvania State Secretary Kathy Boockvar, USPS general counsel Thomas Marshall described the 'risk that ballots requested near the deadline under state law will not be returned by mail in time to be counted under your laws as we understand them,' NBC News reports. The USPS also described Pennsylvania's current deadlines as 'incongruous with the Postal Service's delivery standards,' per Axios. Voters in the swing state can request a mail-in ballot up to Oct. 27, and they have to be received by 8:00 p.m. on Election Day, according to The Hill. But officials in the state are looking to extend the deadline to receive mail-in ballots three days, with Boockvar raising concern in a court filing that 'voters who apply for mail-in ballots in the last week of the application period and return their completed ballot by mail will, through no fault of their own, likely be disenfranchised,' CNN reports. The warning in Pennsylvania came just after President Trump in an interview cited his desire to prevent universal mail-in voting this November, noting that if the Postal Service doesn't get the funding that Democrats are seeking, 'that means you can't have universal mail-in voting, because they're not equipped to have it.'
