      <title>Food supply nightmare...</title>
      <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-facing-food-supply-nightmare-192425383.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Bloomberg) -- Restaurants in Texas are throwing out expired food, grocery stores are closing early amid stock shortages and residents are struggling to find basic necessities as a cold blast continues to upend supply chains.At Tarka Indian Kitchen, a chain with eight locations in Texas, fresh veggies and meat were discarded after the chain was shuttered for days. The same is true for Coolgreens, which sells salads and sandwiches, while Milkshake Concepts had to throw out inventory due to a burst pipe. Similar stories are piling up during a historic cold spell that has knocked out power and snarled roads.At a Whole Foods Market store in the Woodlands, Texas, two women were overheard exchanging tips on where to find a gallon of milk, while another person asked a store employee about buying the entire supply of bottled water.The situation is so dire in Houston, a major city for dining out, some people have running lists of restaurants that are open and have food supplies. Late Thursday, a canvass of restaurants in the area showed several were either out of food, unexpectedly closed or only available for large group orders. People were complaining about difficulties using UberEats and DoorDash as a result.Read More: Texas Water Outages Affect 14.4 Million People: Energy UpdateTarka Chief Executive Officer Tinku Saini said via email that the issues extend beyond expired food. “We’ve transitioned to working through the water challenges -- access to water, low water pressure and boil-water notices in some areas. Then, we are navigating the obstacles with suppliers as they determine the safest way to deliver our products.”The challenges are further limiting residents’ access to food as grocery store shelves remain barren in many areas. Supermarket chains such as Kroger Co. have implemented purchase limits on items such as eggs and milk, while HEB Grocery Co. said the weather is causing “severe disruption in the food supply chain.”Some chains that have managed to remain open have been closing before sunset so shelves can be restocked overnight. Hard-to-find items in the Houston area include beef, bread, deli meats, frozen pizzas and milk. A visit to an HEB store in the city’s northern suburbs on Thursday afternoon found the produce section with little more than a few bags of oranges.Target Corp. closed three stores in Texas and was restocking food and water in stores that are still open. Amazon.com Inc.’s Whole Foods Market chain is working to “reopen all stores in the coming days,” a spokesperson said in an email.Indeed, there’s hope operations may return to normal soon as services come back online and temperatures rise. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the state’s grid, said it had returned to normal operations Friday.Related: Gas Stations Still Dark as Texas Emerges From FreezeStill, many restaurants, which have already endured a nightmare year from pandemic-driven shutdowns, face obstacles to reopening. Some companies are trying to adapt in the meantime.Dickey’s Barbecue Pit, which has 142 Texas locations, said it could be a week or two until it is back to normal hours and full menus, though operations are resuming at most of its restaurants. The company has altered its menu and is going directly to its suppliers when possible to pick up food.On Monday, as the lights flickered at its 80-year-old original location in Dallas, staff began giving away food to first responders instead of letting it expire.“With the understanding that our food is no good to anyone if it’s spoiled and these heroes need it most, I encourage anyone who is able to do the same,” Dickey’s CEO Laura Rea Dickey said.(Updates with details of food shortage beginning in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</description>
