      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.cnn.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Republican National Committee formally kicked off the 2020 campaign season by bestowing President Donald Trump with its "undivided support" on Friday. But while the party merges its organizational efforts with the Trump campaign, there is still an expectation that someone will join the race.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The Latest on the political crisis in Venezuela (all times local): 10:55 a.m. The European Union as a whole says it could recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezeula's leader if the government doesn't announce new elections within the coming days. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement Saturday that the European bloc would intensify contacts with international partners "in the coming hours" on Venezuela's crisis. The EU urgently called for new elections, saying Venezuela's presidential vote last year was not democratic. Mogherini said "in the absence of an announcement on the organization of fresh elections with the necessary guarantees over the next days, the EU will take further actions, including on the issue of recognition of the country's leadership." Earlier Saturday, France, Germany, Britain and Spain set an eight-day deadline for calling electiondsfor recognizing Guaido's leadership. The Europeans' position opens a new front in their tensions with Russia, which strongly supports Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A military base deep inside Saudi Arabia appears to be testing and possibly manufacturing ballistic missiles, experts and satellite images suggest, evidence of the type of weapons program it has long criticized its archrival Iran for possessing. Further raising the stakes for any such program are comments by Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who said last year the kingdom wouldn't hesitate to develop nuclear weapons if Iran does. Ballistic missiles can carry nuclear warheads to targets thousands of kilometers (miles) away.</description>

      <title>PODESTA: An unsurprising but still satisfying indictment...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/opinion/article/John-Podesta-An-unsurprising-but-still-13562962.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite my Italian roots, vengeance doesn't run deep in my veins. But I admit I smiled when Roger Stone's arrest was announced Friday morning. To give some context: On Oct. 7, 2016, WikiLeaks began leaking emails from my personal inbox that had been hacked by Russian intelligence operatives. A few days earlier, Stone - a longtime Republican operative and close confidante of then-candidate Donald Trump - had mysteriously predicted that the organization would reveal damaging information about the Clinton campaign. And weeks before that, he'd even tweeted: "Trust me, it will soon [be] Podesta's time in the barrel." Stone's connection with and boasting about WikiLeaks during the campaign has always been fishy.</description>

      <title>Film shows perils of local journalism...</title>
      <link>https://www.apnews.com/81e184c16df440a3a8a3efd493c6861f</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — HBO's new film on newspaper columnists Jimmy Breslin and Pete Hamill romanticizes an era in New York and journalism that feels like a long, long time ago. The fact that it's very recent history makes "Breslin and Hamill: Deadline Artists" partly a tragedy. The two men embodied a time when New York was a rollicking and complicated place, and each lived for the streets and stories of the little guys who made the city run. Every city had their own Breslins or Hamills, who made the powerful tremble or shake their fists. Their newspapers were required reading.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Santina Muha appeared on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" in 2007, the producers asked which chair she'd rather use: her own, or the studio's. "I asked if anyone else in a wheelchair had ever been on the show," said the actress, who was paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident when she was 6 years old. "They said no, so I said, 'I'll stay in my wheelchair.' " Days after the two-part episode aired, a woman told Muha that her young son, who also uses a wheelchair, was so inspired by seeing the actress on television, she let him stay home from school the next day to watch the conclusion. "I was on TV for, like, 10 minutes, and I got fan mail from other countries," Muha said. "Disability needs to be normalized.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Submitting to mounting pressure amid growing disruption, President Donald Trump agreed to a deal Friday to reopen the government for three weeks, backing down from his demand that Congress give him money for his border wall before federal agencies get back to work. Standing alone in the Rose Garden, Trump said he would sign legislation funding shuttered agencies until Feb. 15 and try again to persuade lawmakers to finance his long-sought wall. The deal he reached with congressional leaders contains no new money for the wall but ends the longest shutdown in U.S. history.</description>

Four rings later, Brady will arrive in Atlanta for the Patriots' Super Bowl matchup with the Los Angeles Rams having already established himself as the most-decorated Super Bowl quarterback in league history.

The self-proclaimed dirty trickster, arrested by the FBI in a raid before dawn Friday at his Florida home, blasted the prosecution as politically motivated. In a circus-like atmosphere outside the courthouse, as supporters cheered him on and spectators shouted "Lock Him Up," Stone proclaimed his innocence and predicted his vindication.</description>

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/819773/5-staggering-details-from-roger-stone-indictment</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roger Stone, longtime adviser to President Trump, has been indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on seven counts. A 24-page indictment released Friday outlines how Stone allegedly misled Congress about his contact with an intermediary to WikiLeaks and ultimately tried to intimidate a witness from cooperating with investigators. Here are some of the most staggering details the indictment reveals: 1. After WikiLeaks released stolen DNC emails in July 2016, a senior Trump campaign official "was directed to contact Stone" to inquire about "any additional releases." The indictment doesn't specify who in the Trump campaign told the official to reach out to Stone. This is the most intriguing line of the Roger Stone indictment. "A senior TrumpCampaign official WAS DIRECTED to contact Stone". Who directed the official? Mueller knows. He knows all about the Campaign's inner workings. pic.twitter.com/uBKIEpM69k â€” Arieh Kovler (@ariehkovler) January 25, 2019 2. In October 2016, after WikiLeaks released stolen campaign emails from Hillary Clinton, an associate of a high-ranking Trump campaign official texted Stone, "well done." The indictment also says Stone talked with "multiple individuals involved in the Trump campaign" about his contacts with his intermediary to WikiLeaks and then falsely told Congress he hadn't done so. 3. Stone is accused of instructing "Person 2," his intermediary to WikiLeaks, to lie to Congress by telling him he "should do a 'Frank Pentangeli,'" referencing a character from The Godfather: Part II who lies to Congress. https://t.co/bpHBfBhkQ0 pic.twitter.com/7hQiWMZvQh â€” Alex Burns (@alexburnsNYT) January 25, 2019 4. Stone, the indictment says, told Congress he never talked to "Person 2" in writing, when Stone and his contact actually "... engaged in frequent written communication by email and text messages." These emails and texts are cited throughout the indictment. 5. The indictment explains that Stone attempted to prevent "Person 2" from cooperating with investigators by threatening him, calling him "a rat" in an email, and saying he would take his dog.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The coalition of Latin American governments that joined the U.S. in quickly recognizing Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president came together over weeks of secret diplomacy that included whispered messages to activists under constant surveillance and a high-risk foreign trip by the opposition leader challenging President Nicolas Maduro for power, those involved in the talks said. In mid-December, Guaido quietly traveled to Washington, Colombia and Brazil to brief officials on the opposition's strategy of mass demonstrations to coincide with Maduro's expected swearing-in for a second term on Jan. 10 in the face of widespread international condemnation, according to exiled former Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma, an ally.</description>

Privacy and civil rights advocates have called on Amazon to stop marketing its Rekognition service because of worries about discrimination against minorities. Some Amazon investors have also asked the company to stop out of fear that it makes Amazon vulnerable to lawsuits.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TOKYO (AP) — Human rights and LGBT activists on Friday denounced a ruling by Japan's Supreme Court upholding a law that effectively requires transgender people to be sterilized before they can have their gender changed on official documents. The court said the law is constitutional because it was meant to reduce confusion in families and society. But it acknowledged that it restricts freedom and could become out of step with changing social values.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Mexican government said Friday the United States plans to return 20 migrants per day to Mexico as they await an answer to their U.S. asylum claims. Roberto Velasco, the spokesman for Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said "the Mexican government doesn't agree with this unilateral move," but will accept the migrants under certain conditions. Velasco said the first 20 migrants would be returned at the San Ysidro crossing, across from Tijuana, "in the next few hours." He said all are Central Americans and all apparently had temporary visas in Mexico.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BISMARCK, N.D.

Cold weather advisories were in effect from North Dakota to Ohio, with dangerously cold wind chills that could dip to as low as 45 below zero (negative 42 Celsius) in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota and to 35 below (negative 37 Celsius) in parts of northern Illinois and Iowa.</description>
