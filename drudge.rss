      <title>HUNGER SPIKES: 10% of U.S. households going hungry...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/935466/10th-american-households-say-havent-enough-food-during-pandemic</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stock market is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, but working Americans are not. The coronavirus pandemic led to business shutdowns that in turn translated into the biggest employment numbers the country has ever seen. The slumping economy shocked even the most food secure states in the U.S., with one in ten Americans reporting they didn't have enough food during a given week amid the pandemic, Bloomberg reports. While the U.S. is no stranger to hunger, it usually is at its worst in the rural south, while midwestern states ranked among the most food secure in the country. And when the whole country has gone hungry in the past, it usually stemmed from food shortages, like during the Dust Bowl or World War II rationing, Bloomberg notes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, meanwhile, farmers had to dump millions of gallons of milk and other food they couldn't sell or donate. Even Americans 'surrounded by food' haven't been able to afford to eat during this pandemic, Bloomberg writes. That included people in the farm-rich state of Minnesota, where nearly 70 percent of those accessing emergency food pantries were doing so for the first time. Across the country, a third of hungry Americans used emergency food distributors for the first time as well, according to Feeding America. And with millions of Americans still out of work, many people are still without sufficient food supplies. President Trump on Tuesday didn't mention the rampant hunger still lingering throughout the U.S. as he praised August's 'very impressive' stock market rebound. Read more at Bloomberg.

      <title>Brain on barbells: Can strength training improve mood?</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/lifestyle/article/Your-brain-on-barbells-Can-strength-training-15536965.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exercise changed my life. It managed to do what medication alone couldn't: put a dagger into my depression.  I've struggled with depressive illness since childhood, and throughout the years, my brain and body have often felt like a one-man clinical trial for every antidepressant that came to the market. Prozac? Been there! Luvox? Done that! Effexor? Check! Paxil, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Zoloft? Check . . . check . . . check . . . and check-a-rooni!  Although mood-stabilizing pill packs have entered and exited my life with varying degrees of success over the past 30 years, one treatment option has remained a constant, reliable, no-fail mood booster throughout the decades. That would be exercise. But not just any exercise. Not the elliptical. Not spin class. Not the recumbent bike nor the rowing machine. In fact, it's not aerobic exercise at all, which has been most commonly linked to a reduction in depressive illness.  It's strength training - the muscle-building, body-toning and sometimes grunt-inducing workout - that has helped transform my chronic mental illness into better mental health. In fact, once I began a regular regimen of resistance training, the positive shift in my mood, my confidence and my self-image was so pronounced that I switched careers.  I left my work in the social service field to become a personal trainer and eventually a college professor of fitness and health promotion. Whether lecturing students, speaking to audiences or coaching clients, encouraging others to strength train for better mental health has become my mantra, my message and my life mission.  But I'm not basing this message on my firsthand experience alone. New research is validating what I feel every time I pump iron: peace of mind and a sense of achievement.  The impact of resistance training on emotional disorders is an emerging area...</description>

      <title>Tactics of White House trade adviser draw new scrutiny as some of his pandemic moves unravel...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Tactics-of-fiery-White-House-trade-adviser-draw-15536821.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Amid the Trump administration's troubled response to the coronavirus pandemic, senior White House aide Peter Navarro has refashioned himself as a powerful government purchasing chief, operating far beyond his original role as an adviser on trade policy.  But U.S. officials say the abrasive figure's shortcomings as a manager could influence how well prepared the United States is for a second wave of coronavirus infections expected this fall.  Navarro's harsh manner and disregard for protocol have alienated numerous colleagues, corporate executives and prominent Republicans. In a previously undisclosed incident, the White House Counsel's Office in 2018 investigated Navarro's behavior in response to repeated complaints and found he routinely had been verbally abusive toward others. Navarro narrowly avoided losing his job, but the abuse has continued as the White House has grappled with the pandemic, multiple administration officials said.  On Monday, the administration terminated one contract that Navarro had directly negotiated - for 42,900 Philips ventilators. A Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said the cancellation was "subject to internal HHS investigation and legal review." The contract had been criticized by a House oversight subcommittee, which concluded that the government had overpaid for the ventilators by $500 million.  The cancellation came after another transaction Navarro championed, a government loan to fund Kodak's transformation into a drugmaker, unraveled and became embroiled in a securities investigation. The watchdog panel says it is broadening its inquiry to examine all of Navarro's deals.  Navarro remains unbowed, scorning critics inside and outside the White House as disloyal and leaning heavily on his one true ally: President Donald Trump. The trade specialist's...</description>

The House Oversight Committee last year began looking into the use of private accounts for government business by Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also has used private email to conduct government business.Donald Trump spent much of the 2016 election cycle drawing attention to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she served as secretary of state, calling it "worse than Watergate."  The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the first lady's emails.  A first lady is not a government employee,...</description>
