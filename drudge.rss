      <title>MELANIA USED PRIVATE EMAIL ACCOUNT WHILE IN WHITE HOUSE</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/First-lady-used-private-email-former-adviser-and-15535547.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melania Trump regularly used a private Trump Organization email account, an email from a MelaniaTrump.com domain, iMessage and the encrypted messaging app, Signal, while in the White House, according to her former senior adviser and close friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who says she corresponded multiple times a day with the first lady. "Melania and I both didn't use White House emails," says Winston Wolkoff, in an interview with The Washington Post, upon the publication of her tell-all memoir, "Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady."  The Post has viewed messages dated after the inauguration that appear to be from private email and messaging accounts used by Melania Trump. The messages contained discussions of government hires and contracts (including Winston Wolkoff's), detailed schedules for the president and first lady during the Israeli and Japanese state visits, strategic partnerships for the first lady's Be Best initiative, the logistics of the Easter Egg Roll, and finances for the presidential inauguration, key parts of which Winston Wolkoff, an experienced New York City events producer, planned.  Members of the Trump administration have already faced scrutiny for using private email. The House Oversight Committee last year began looking into the use of private accounts for government business by Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also has used private email to conduct government business.Donald Trump spent much of the 2016 election cycle drawing attention to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she served as secretary of state, calling it "worse than Watergate."  The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the first lady's emails.  A first lady is not a government employee,...</description>

      <title>POLL: Most think Feds making pandemic worse...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/935185/60-percent-americans-say-federal-governments-coronavirus-response-making-pandemic-worse</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The U.S.'s COVID-19 response has fallen far behind most of the rest of the world's â€” and many Americans think the federal government is largely to blame. In contrast to President Trump's false insistence that the U.S. has one of the world's lowest mortality rates from coronavirus, a New York Times analysis published Tuesday shows the U.S. actually accounts for more than its population's share of COVID-19 deaths. And Americans largely recognize the U.S.'s failures, with 60 percent of them saying the federal government's COVID-19 response is actually making the pandemic worse, an Axios-Ipsos poll has found. Just 39 percent of Americans say the federal government is making America's coronavirus recovery better, the poll found, though there's a sharp divide between parties. Only 19 percent of Democrats say the federal government is making things better, while 80 percent say things are getting worse. Independents largely agree, with 68 percent say the government isn't helping. Meanwhile 74 percent of Republicans say the federal government is improving things, while 25 percent say it's actively worsening the pandemic, the poll found. Beyond just his response, Americans don't even trust Trump to give them accurate information regarding the coronavirus, the Axios-Ipsos poll says. But things aren't much better for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden â€” 31 percent of Americans say they trust Trump for accurate COVID-19 information, while 46 percent say they trust Biden. The Axios-Ipsos poll surveyed 1,100 adults from Aug. 28-31, with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>Costa Rica now allowing U.S. visitors -- but only from 12 places...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/lifestyle/article/Costa-Rica-is-now-allowing-U-S-visitors-but-15529599.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In March, Costa Rica imposed strict land and air border closures, effectively shutting U.S. travelers out of the small Central American nation. Beginning in waves this September, however, residents of 11 states and D.C. will be allowed to visit Costa Rica once again, with a negative coronavirus test result in hand.  Beginning Sept. 1, Americans with a valid state ID proving their residency in Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Virginia or D.C. can enter Costa Rica under the new terms.  Beginning Sept. 15, Americans with valid state IDs for Colorado, Massachusetts or Pennsylvania will also be permitted to enter under the new rules.  Costa Rica appears to be the first destination allowing Americans to visit based on their home state, and the tourism board says the list of authorized regions is being "revised periodically."  All visitors, regardless of their home country or state, will be required to have a negative coronavirus test result acquired within 72 hours before their flight. Travelers will also need to have proof of medical insurance and fill out a health form online, according to a statement by the Costa Rica Tourism Board.  "The entry of travelers from these 12 states is allowed because they currently have an epidemiological condition similar or lower levels of contagion to those of Costa Rica," Tourism Minister Gustavo J. Segura said in a news conference Thursday.  Visitors will be permitted to arrive through a connecting airport in another state as long as they do not leave the airport during their layover.  Costa Rica has not allowed U.S. travelers to enter since it imposed closures in March. On Aug. 1, the country began accepting some foreign nationals with a negative coronavirus test result, including Canadians and E.U. Schengen-zone residents. On Aug. 19, the...</description>
