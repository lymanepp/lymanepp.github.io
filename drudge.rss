      <title>Biden entry provides jolt to Bernie candidacy...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Biden-s-entry-into-the-Democratic-race-provides-a-13838004.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's been no more consistent performer in the field of Democratic presidential candidates than Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. From the day he first announced his candidacy in the spring of 2015 straight on through to today, as he makes his second run for the White House, his message has remained constant, his style has varied not at all. Bernie is Bernie.  The policy ideas he put forward in the 2016 race, during his surprisingly strong challenge to Hillary Clinton, have become more broadly accepted within the Democratic Party. He has defined and expanded the party's progressive wing and given voice to liberals who found Barack Obama's presidency disappointing for its timidity in areas of policy. He has made the words "democratic socialism" part of the political lexicon.  Sanders has redefined presidential fundraising, demonstrating in 2016 that the traditional approach of relying on wealthy individuals to write checks for the maximum allowed under the law and building a big team of bundlers who would raise hundreds of thousands of campaign dollars through their personal networks wasn't the only way. Sanders showed that small but regular contributions from hundreds of thousands of people can fuel and sustain an underdog candidacy.  The senator from Vermont's first-quarter performance - financially, politically and rhetorically - helped establish him as a power in the contest for the nomination. As the Democratic field took shape in those earlier months, he became the biggest name and impressed some of the skeptics who discounted him.  But Sanders is no longer the biggest name in the field. That title now goes to former Vice President Joe Biden, who became a candidate just two weeks ago. His entry into the 2020 fray and the initial impact of his candidacy have pointed to questions about the trajectory of Sanders' candidacy...</description>

      <title>Detention cells so overcrowded US using aircraft to move migrants...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Border-detention-cells-in-Texas-are-so-13837856.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overcrowding at Border Patrol stations in South Texas has become so acute in recent days that U.S. authorities have taken the rare step of using aircraft to relocate migrants to other areas of the border simply to begin processing them, according to three Homeland Security officials.  The first flight left McAllen, Texas, on Friday, transferring detainees to Border Patrol facilities in Del Rio, Texas. There are daily flights scheduled for the next several days, with two planned for Tuesday, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the operations.  The flights are conducted by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, but the detainees remain in the custody of Border Patrol, officials said. Though ICE routinely uses aircraft to move detainees among its detention facilities, it is very unusual for Border Patrol to fly recent arrivals from one part of the border to another to perform routine booking procedures.  Homeland Security officials requested the aircraft because Border Patrol urgently needs to move single adults out of the lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. The agency is scrambling to make room for the large volume of families and children who have come across the border in dramatically higher numbers in the past several days, officials said.  One official said the U.S. government has resorted to using aircraft because all available buses were already in use and authorities needed every available transportation option.  "This is the worst I have ever seen it, by far," said one veteran Border Patrol agent in South Texas who was not authorized to speak to reporters.  The number of people taken into custody along the Mexico border has exceeded 5,500 each day for several days in a row, and Border Patrol currently has more than 17,500 people in holding cells and tent sites set up in...</description>
