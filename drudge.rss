      <title>For TV networks missing sports, there's one unthinkable scenario: Losing NFL season...</title>
      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/For-TV-networks-missing-sports-there-s-one-15382020.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout the spring and into the summer - without the NBA playoffs and baseball's opening weeks - the sports world has continued to feel the steady drumbeat of the NFL. The league opened free agency as usual, providing news-making moments such as Tom Brady signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and then its April draft went off without a hitch, delivering boffo ratings for ESPN.  For the TV networks and sports media outlets that cover the league, this has been most welcome. But as the calendar flips to July, with NFL training camps set to open at the end of the month, doubts have surfaced about the viability of football season. Coronavirus cases are spiking in states across the country. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said football players may need to be in a bubble environment for the season to be played. Los Angeles Rams Coach Sean McVay wondered aloud how teams will be able to both play and take precautions.  "I mean, we're going to social distance, but we play football?" McVay said during a recent media appearance. "It's really hard for me to understand all this."  While there remains plenty of optimism the NFL will play - somehow, someway - networks are now fixated on the league's fall schedule, given its dominant position as America's most valuable television property. They are invested, of course, in the planned returns of Major League Baseball, the NBA and other sports, but none carry the importance of the NFL, which accounted for 41 of the top 50 rated telecasts of any kind in 2019. The lack of certainty has led to uncomfortable conversations among executives.  "It's practically the only thing on the minds of the networks," said John Kosner, a former ESPN executive who is now an industry consultant. "If you lost an NFL season, you're looking at a financial...</description>

      <title>White House won't retaliate over Kremlin bounty reports...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/White-House-won-t-retaliate-over-Kremlin-bounty-15380916.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The White House is not planning an immediate response to intelligence reports of Russian bounties given to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan because President Donald Trump does not believe the reports are true or "actionable," according to two senior administration officials.  Trump is not convinced he should do anything about the bounty issue, which he decried in a Wednesday morning tweet as "just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party." One administration official said there is an internal White House dispute about how much information to declassify to support the president's skepticism of the intelligence.  Some of Trump's own senior intelligence officials viewed the information as credible enough to warn the Pentagon and allies so they could ensure they had measures in place to protect their forces in Afghanistan, and to begin developing options for responding to the Russian operation, national security adviser Robert O'Brien said Wednesday.  And though the administration has sought to downplay the veracity of the intelligence, O'Brien said the CIA has asked the Justice Department to open a leak investigation on the matter.  The officials cautioned that Trump's posture could change as pressure mounts from Congress to respond to the reports of Russian bounties, as intelligence analysts suspect the deaths of three Marines in Afghanistan in 2019 may have resulted from the Russian operation. Like others interviewed, the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.  White House communications director Alyssa Farah declined to comment on the intelligence reports except to say they were "uncorroborated," and to criticize "selectively leaked intelligence." The president, she said, "always...</description>

      <title>Campaign STILL contending with fallout from Tulsa rally...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trump-campaign-still-contending-with-fallout-from-15380940.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was just hours before President Donald Trump was set to take the stage for his rally in Tulsa last month when the news broke: Six staff at the site had just tested positive for the coronavirus.  The president, who was en route from Washington, was livid that the news was public, according to people familiar with his reaction. In the tent outside the BOK Center, where campaign staff were being tested before the event, the release of the information caused a scramble.  Health-care workers were quizzed about whether they had leaked the information about the positive cases to the news media - and then were given a different list of people to test, according to two people with direct knowledge of the events.  The flurry inside the tent was part of a cascade of events triggered by Trump's insistence on holding the June 20 rally inside the Tulsa arena, despite the adamant warnings of health officials about the rising risks of the novel coronavirus in Oklahoma.  Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, said the Trump campaign "performed more tests than originally anticipated" in Tulsa, adding that the event was in compliance with Oklahoma state guidelines and that campaign employees "wore masks during the rally in accordance with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines."  He did not respond to follow-up questions about who received the additional tests at the site, which provided screening for not just staff, but local leaders and top Trump supporters, as well. He declined to specify whether more campaign staffers than anticipated were tested.  The White House referred requests for comment to the campaign.  On Sunday, a second round of testing was provided in Virginia for campaign staff, according to people familiar with the event. Murtaugh, who initially declined to...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/A-backyard-soiree-and-then-the-virus-15379805.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is A Cautionary Tale featuring well-intentioned people making poor choices. It is also the tale of a socialite with an Instagram habit who recently held a fabulous backyard soiree during a pandemic. The upside of living on social media is the admiration and envy of your friends. The downside is when your dinner party goes viral. Literally.  Ashley Taylor Bronczek, one of Washington, D.C.'s social stars, decided to throw a party after the Washington Ballet's online fundraiser, which she co-chaired. The June 18 gala was a huge success, raising more than $800,000 - the top sponsors were her generous in-laws, David and Judy Bronczek. To celebrate the occasion, she hosted a catered dinner for a couple dozen friends in the backyard of her home. It was, by all accounts, a picture-perfect night chronicled on (per usual) her Instagram account.  Then Bronczek, 37, was diagnosed with covid-19, along with a few other guests at the event. The news spread quickly through the wealthy young families in her social circle because their small children play together. Friends begged her to take down photos of the party, which she eventually did. But details of the evening - some true, some exaggerated - were already all over town.  This summer everyone is struggling to balance their yearning for normality with the risk of catching this virus. Young is safer than old. Outside is better than inside. Masks are better than no masks. And a handful of people are wiser than a lot of people. And so we make the calculation to attend or skip drinks on the patio, a backyard barbecue, a socially distanced birthday party. Most of the time it's fine. Unless it isn't.  Citing health issues, Bronczek originally offered to answer questions for this article via email, then changed her mind and declined to comment. Some guests who attended the party also...</description>
