      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEDMINSTER TOWNSHIP, N.J. - It was important for Sandra Diaz to be invisible.  Before entering the Trump family villa, she would tie back her hair, pull on latex gloves and step into delicate paper shoe coverings. She knew not to wear makeup or perfume that might leave the faintest trace of her presence.  As Donald Trump's personal maid, Diaz was dealing with a fussy celebrity owner who presided like a monarch over the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster long before he was elevated to president. She was an immigrant from Costa Rica working illegally for Trump with a fake Social Security card she had bought for $50. Being invisible was her life's work.  Moving quickly through the two-story house in the mornings, Diaz carried out Trump's fastidious instructions. In his closet, she would hang six sets of identical golf outfits: six white polo shirts, six pairs of beige pants, six neatly ironed pairs of boxer shorts. She would smear a dollop of Trump's liquid face makeup on the back of her hand to make sure it hadn't dried out.  The years of service that Diaz and other undocumented immigrant housekeepers, cooks, landscapers, greenskeepers, waiters, bellhops, farm hands and caddies devoted to the Trump Organization have given them a remarkable vantage point into the unvarnished lives of the now-first family. They have seen poolside tantrums and holiday arguments. They've laughed with the in-laws and watched after the grandkids.  Their recollections also show how Trump's entrance into presidential politics - denouncing illegal immigrants as criminals and job-stealers - upended their lives and prompted some of them to publicly confront their former boss.  Over the past year, The Washington Post has spoken with 48 people who had worked illegally for the Trump Organization at 11 of its properties in Florida, New Jersey, New York...</description>

      <title>Trump rejects Nixon, Clinton precedent...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Trump-rejects-Nixon-Clinton-precedent-on-14881575.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The showdown had been years in the making, Bill Clinton's personal lawyer confronting the lead investigator pushing for the second ever impeachment of a sitting president.  "Mr. Starr, good evening," David Kendall, the presidential attorney, said in November 1998.  "Good evening," replied Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel investigating Clinton. "How are you, David?"  "I'm very well, Ken," Kendall said.  For the next hour the two legal giants squared off in a prime-time clash exactly a month before the House voted to impeach President Clinton for his effort to cover up an affair with a White House intern. They debated the facts of the case and the merits of impeachment, as both Republicans and Democrats barely said a word.  It was the sort of legal battle royal that President Donald Trump would probably love to see from his legal team, feisty and carried live on national cable TV.  But Trump, unlike Clinton and President Richard Nixon in 1974, has opted against having legal advisers present for the House Judiciary Committee's first impeachment hearing Wednesday.  The White House decision, delivered to Democrats Sunday evening, accused them of a "complete lack of due process" but left open the possibility that his legal team "may consider participating" in future hearings if they are deemed a true process.  That move relinquishes Trump's side of the fight to Republicans on the committee, an unusual move for a president who loves to see his own top aides in public sparring with Democrats and the media. Many of those GOP lawmakers are his closest allies, and they plan to vigorously fight Democrats over committee procedures.  Some Republicans have quietly wondered whether this is a mistake, that it leaves out another combatant in the room who would be on Trump's...</description>
