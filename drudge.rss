      <title>Advice from a woman who survived 1918 flu, cancer and covid-19!</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/lifestyle/article/Advice-from-a-woman-who-survived-covid-19-the-15454667.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are in a pandemic today that the world hasn't seen the likes of in 102 years.  Mildred Geraldine "Gerri" Schappals is one of the few people in the world who has survived both. The 102-year-old New Englander lived through a severe bout of the flu during the 1918 pandemic as a baby. And now, a century later, punctuated by two bouts of cancer, Schappals also has recovered from covid-19 in the pandemic of 2020.  Schappals - an Irish Catholic known for her witty one-liners - is the oldest resident at the Huntington at Nashua, a retirement and assisted-living community in Nashua, N.H.  "I don't think of myself as old," said Schappals, who is moderately deaf and provided an interview through her daughter, Julia Schappals.  Julia Schappals, 68, calls her mother feisty and tough and "an example of a good, fighting treasure."  She is an anomaly, and not just because of her age. The elder Schappals was not particularly health-conscious throughout her life, yet she seems to have a bulletproof immune system. She credits that to the 1918 flu pandemic, her daughter said.  Julia Schappals cannot recall a single time when her mother got sick with a respiratory ailment like the cold or flu. In fact, Gerri Schappals had disdain for anyone who did get sick.  "I really think that having the 1918 flu strengthened everything about me," she said. "I never had colds or illnesses until I got cancer, and even then I pulled through. It's either that or Mother Nature thinks I died in 1918, so she ignores me."  - - -  Gerri Schappals was born in Worcester, Mass., on Jan. 18, 1918, when World War I was raging, and women didn't have the right to vote. Eleven months after she was born - in November, the same month when the war officially ended - baby Gerri, her mother and her teenage brother, Joseph, came...</description>

      <title>DRAMA:  Biden's delay in announcing VP intensifies jockeying between potential picks...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Biden-s-delay-in-announcing-running-mate-15453258.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has extended his vice-presidential search by as much as two weeks, intensifying the jockeying and lobbying between allies of the women who hope to join his White House. Even some longtime Biden allies worry that the process has become "messier than it should be," pitting women, especially Black women, against one another.  The dynamic threatens to undermine Biden's effort to use the vice-presidential search to spotlight some of the party's brightest female stars during the highly public vetting process. And it's already providing President Donald Trump's campaign an opening to dig up dirt and launch attacks on potential rivals.  "It's been relentless. It's been unfortunate. But I must say it's been predictable," said Donna Brazile, a former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee. "It's extremely disappointing, because many of these attacks . . . are being made by Democratic men who should know better."  "I would hope that in this selection process, we are mindful that Black women - and women of color - deserve respect," she added.  The increasing nastiness is fueled by a sense, even among Biden's closest advisers, that Biden is entering the final phase of the search without a clear favorite. Rather than a traditional "short list" of three candidates, people close to the process expect him to interview five or six finalists for the position.  The delay has intensified currents that have been swirling for weeks, said several people interviewed. The resulting backbiting risks inflaming divisions within the party that complicated the 2016 campaign - but that Biden has worked to coalesce since locking down the nomination in the spring.  A recent Politico report said former senator Chris Dodd, D-Conn., who is on Biden's vice-presidential vetting panel, told donors that Sen....</description>

      <title>America may not know if Trump or Biden wins -- until Thanksgiving!</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/928979/america-may-not-know-trump-biden-wins-2020-election-until-thanksgiving</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Picture this Thanksgiving: turkey, football (maybe), tenser-than-usual interactions with relatives,' media columnist Ben Smith writes at The New York Times. 'And perhaps a new tradition: finding out who actually won the presidential election.' The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to prompt a surge in mail-in voting, at a time when the U.S. Postal Service is grappling with service-slowing cost-cutting measures handed down by the new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, a major donor to President Trump. Key states like Pennsylvania may be counting those ballots for weeks after Election Day, and with Trump filling that time tweeting more 'false allegations about fraud,' Smith writes, 'the last barriers between American democracy and a deep political crisis may be television news.' TV hosts, election analysts, network chiefs, and social media executives exude 'blithe confidence' about their ability to handle an election that won't be decided for days or weeks, Smith writes, but there's 'near panic among some of the people paying the closest attention.' 'The nerds are freaking out,' Brandon Finnigan, the founder of Decision Desk HQ, told the Times. 'I don't think it's penetrated enough in the average viewer's mind that there's not going to be an election night. The usual razzmatazz of a panel sitting around discussing election results â€” that's dead.' Media companies can prepare their viewers and change how they report election results, 'but what the moment calls for, most of all, is patience,' Smith writes. 'And good luck with that.' 'Nobody I talked to had any real idea how cable talkers or Twitter take-mongers would fill hours, days, and, possibly, weeks of counting or how to apply a sober, careful lens to the wild allegations â€” rigged voting machines, mysterious buses of outsiders turning up at poll sites â€” that surface every election night, only to dissolve in the light of day,' Smith said. But one war game of an election in which Joe Biden wins a big popular majority and tiny electoral college loss ended with the U.S. military casting the deciding vote. Read more at The New York Times.

      <title>The downward spiral of Ellen: A complete guide...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/entertainment/article/The-downward-spiral-of-Ellen-DeGeneres-s-public-15453872.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did "50 Shades of Grey" star Dakota Johnson bring down one of the most popular talk show hosts in history?  Well, no - but you might have recently seen a lot of jokes on Twitter that say as much. Ellen DeGeneres's reputation has been on a downward slide since roughly last fall, when, during a particularly awkward interview, DeGeneres accused Johnson of not inviting her to a birthday party and Johnson replied with the now infamous quote, "Actually, no, that's not the truth, Ellen."  But that was just one in a series of controversial incidents surrounding DeGeneres, which culminated in a much more serious way last week after a pair of BuzzFeed articles alleged a toxic work environment on the daily talk show, as well as allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct by producers. Warner Bros. launched an internal investigation. DeGeneres sent an email to staff that said she took responsibility as the face of the show, but criticized her employees for not "do[ing] their jobs as they knew I'd want them done." As a result, she wrote, she and the production company will be "taking steps, together, to correct the issues."  If you're curious about how things got to this point, here's a guide to how DeGeneres's public persona went from the "new Queen of Nice" to even fellow celebrities calling her out for treating people "horribly."  - December 2018: The New York Times profile  Even if you don't regularly tune in to the comedian's hugely successful talk show (on the air since 2003), you probably know one thing: She's known for being super nice! Not only is her daily sign-off "be kind to one another," she used to open each episode with some goofy dancing, which endeared millions of viewers to her every afternoon. She frequently gives money and gifts to people in need, and has had many viral segments involving adorable small...</description>
