      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/A-backyard-soiree-and-then-the-virus-15379805.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is A Cautionary Tale featuring well-intentioned people making poor choices. It is also the tale of a socialite with an Instagram habit who recently held a fabulous backyard soiree during a pandemic. The upside of living on social media is the admiration and envy of your friends. The downside is when your dinner party goes viral. Literally.  Ashley Taylor Bronczek, one of Washington, D.C.'s social stars, decided to throw a party after the Washington Ballet's online fundraiser, which she co-chaired. The June 18 gala was a huge success, raising more than $800,000 - the top sponsors were her generous in-laws, David and Judy Bronczek. To celebrate the occasion, she hosted a catered dinner for a couple dozen friends in the backyard of her home. It was, by all accounts, a picture-perfect night chronicled on (per usual) her Instagram account.  Then Bronczek, 37, was diagnosed with covid-19, along with a few other guests at the event. The news spread quickly through the wealthy young families in her social circle because their small children play together. Friends begged her to take down photos of the party, which she eventually did. But details of the evening - some true, some exaggerated - were already all over town.  This summer everyone is struggling to balance their yearning for normality with the risk of catching this virus. Young is safer than old. Outside is better than inside. Masks are better than no masks. And a handful of people are wiser than a lot of people. And so we make the calculation to attend or skip drinks on the patio, a backyard barbecue, a socially distanced birthday party. Most of the time it's fine. Unless it isn't.  Citing health issues, Bronczek originally offered to answer questions for this article via email, then changed her mind and declined to comment. Some guests who attended the party also...</description>

      <title>CLARENCE THOMAS SET TO RETIRE?</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Trump-supporters-hope-to-use-conservative-anger-15379138.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The White House is trying to capitalize on conservative anger at Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. over his latest decisions by telling evangelical leaders and other activists that they need to turn out voters for President Donald Trump so he can use a second term to continue nominating conservative judges to the nation's highest court.  Some recent polls have shown a weakening in support for Trump among evangelicals, who have long been among the president's strongest supporters. But Roberts's role in cases advancing both gay and abortion rights is now seen in the White House as an opening to shore up that part of Trump's political base.  Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said there is frustration and disappointment in evangelical ranks about Roberts's rulings, but he said he and others are not going to walk away from Trump.  "Voters of faith know that that project to shift the court in a more conservative direction is on the 5-yard line and it's a strategic imperative to get President Trump reelected," Reed said. "The Louisiana decision has brought the life issue into fuller relief and reminded us why we have to give the president the chance to nominate more justices."  In a remarkable stretch of decisions over the past two weeks, Roberts has infuriated conservatives and the Trump administration by finding that federal anti-discrimination law protects gay, bisexual and transgender workers and stopping the president from ending the federal program that protects undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children.  In Monday's decision striking down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law, Roberts said the court's allegiance to honoring its past decisions meant striking down a law almost identical to one in Texas that the court...</description>

      <title>Drug overdoses soar...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Cries-for-help-Drug-overdoses-are-soaring-15379338.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bodies have been arriving at Anahi Ortiz's office in frantic spurts - as many as nine overdose deaths in 36 hours. "We've literally run out of wheeled carts to put them on," said Ortiz, a coroner in Columbus, Ohio.  In Roanoke County, Va., police have responded to twice as many fatal overdoses in recent months as in all of last year.  In Kentucky, which just celebrated its first decline in overdose deaths after five years of crisis, many towns are experiencing an abrupt reversal in the numbers.  Nationwide, federal and local officials are reporting alarming spikes in drug overdoses - a hidden epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic. Emerging evidence suggests that the continued isolation, economic devastation and disruptions to the drug trade in recent months are fueling the surge.  Because of how slowly the government collects data, it could be five to six months before definitive numbers exist on the change in overdoses during the pandemic. But data obtained by The Washington Post from a real-time tracker of drug-related emergency calls and interviews with coroners suggest that overdoses have not just increased since the pandemic began but are accelerating as it persists.  Suspected overdoses nationally - not all of them fatal - jumped 18% in March compared with last year, 29% in April and 42% in May, according to the Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program, a federal initiative that collects data from ambulance teams, hospitals and police. In some jurisdictions, such as Milwaukee County, dispatch calls for overdoses have increased more than 50%.  When the pandemic hit, some authorities hoped it might lead to a decrease in overdoses by disrupting drug traffic as borders closed and cities shut down. The opposite seems to be happening.  As traditional supply...</description>

      <title>Carl Reiner's key to living a long, funny life? Never stop having something to say...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/entertainment/article/Carl-Reiner-s-key-to-living-a-long-funny-life-15377662.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once funny, always funny? If you were Carl Reiner, yes.  Those great, beloved nonagenarians of show business (Reiner, his pals Mel Brooks and Norman Lear, Dick Van Dyke, Betty White, et al.) are all the proof we'll ever need that a sense of humor could well have something to do with longevity. It must. And it's not just the laughter. It's having a laugh with someone who knows you better than anyone else - the friends and loved ones, but also the audience, who has also known you forever.  In a 2017 HBO documentary appropriately titled "If You're Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast," Reiner (who died Monday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif., at 98) sat with Brooks and Lear and reminisced about the long weekend retreats they used to take together, with their spouses, a tradition they fondly called "Yenemvelt" (a variation on the Yiddish yenevelt), a word that refers to a kind of hereafter, a world yet to come - a far-off place where, as Reiner's mother taught him, all the good things would happen to you that weren't happening to you here and now.  The three friends believed they had never laughed harder, and felt closer, than during those days in their own Yenemvelt. (Lear even brought up Yenemvelt when I interviewed him a few years ago; framed photos from those weekends were in easy reach on the desk in his home office.)  In the documentary, Brooks wonders: Is laughter what's keeping us alive?  "While you're alive, you can laugh," Reiner replies. "When you're dead, the laughter is so difficult. So difficult."  Reiner never stopped coming up with a good line, something to say - funny or melancholy or trenchant. His last musings on his personal Twitter account appear to have been written just hours before he died. There is a final act of resistance - "As I arose at 7:30 this...</description>

      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/business/article/Workers-getting-laid-off-for-second-time-as-15377041.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she was first furloughed in March, Randee Heitzmann knew how to make ends meet.  She deferred payments on her new Honda Civic, spent $3,000 in stimulus money and tax returns on other payments, and drained her savings.  Then she was called back to her job, as a bartender at a cigar bar near Dallas for five weeks, taking home about $100 per shift, just 20% of what she was used to.  But on Friday, Heitzmann was cut loose again, hours before her shift was to begin.  "I don't have any savings left," the 28-year-old said. "I don't know how long it's going to be before I get a paycheck again."  Millions of American workers are suffering from economic whiplash, thinking they were finally returning to work only to be sent home again because of the coronavirus's latest surge. Stores, restaurants, gyms and other businesses that reopened weeks ago are shuttering again, and this time Congress appears less inclined to provide additional aid. Other businesses that had banked on customers returning and restrictions lifting - such as hotel chains, construction firms and movie theaters - are seeing hours cut and reopening dates pushed back indefinitely as consumer demand stalls.  And many governors, including some who had drawn scrutiny for initially playing down the virus's risks, are issuing new safety restrictions, in some cases just weeks after the first round of guidelines had begun to lift. In recent weeks, three states - California, Florida and Texas - have implemented policies that partly restrict restaurant or bar service. Nine others - Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico and North Carolina - have postponed or slowed reopening plans.  Thousands of workers are caught in these rapidly shifting seas, many of them hourly and low-wage...</description>
