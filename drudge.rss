      <title>Dating in San Fran 'total nightmare': 'Everyone poly'...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/why-dating-is-terrible-hard-apps-tinder-single-13611204.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I spent about six years actively dating around the Bay Area. In that time I dated, for varying amounts of time, three self-described indie rockers, an amateur hockey player, an elementary school teacher with a drinking problem, a yoga teacher who didn't drink alcohol (or consume processed sugars and carbohydrates of any kind), an English teacher living in his mom's in-home daycare, and a skateboarding enthusiast who worked as a manager at a tech company.  These budding relationships ended for various reasons. At least three of the aforementioned men were still in love with their exes. One said he couldn't handle the pressure of texting me "witty responses," and thus could not go on seeing me. Most of the rest were "not looking for something serious."  I attributed these failures not to the region in which I was dating, but to the fraught Millennial dating landscape as a whole. Perhaps I was wrong in thinking this, according to a popular San Francisco Reddit thread, posted just in time for Valentine's Day.  The poster asked, "What annoys you the most about dating in SF?" More than 100 comments later, it appears there is much to be perturbed by. We've included some of the most insightful comments in the above thread. The comments have been lightly edited for clarity.</description>

      <title>AMAZON to pay $0 in taxes -- for second year in row...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/823590/amazon-pay-0-federal-income-taxes-second-year-row</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amazon, which doubled its profits and made more than $11 billion in 2018, won't pay any federal income taxes for the second year in a row, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reported on Wednesday. The company will not be required to pay the standard 21 percent income tax rate on its 2018 profits, and is claiming a tax rebate of $129 million, which ITEP describes as a "a tax rate of negative 1 percent." Amazon drew ire in 2018 for not paying federal taxes on its $5.6 billion in profits the year before, which was made possible due to tax credits and stock-based compensation, reports Politifact. Last year was the first time Amazon paid no federal income tax whatsoever. From 2011 to 2016, Amazon payed federal income tax at a rate of 11.4 percent â€” less than half of the national rate of 35 percent. Due to President Trump's corporate-friendly tax cuts, Amazon will pay any deferred or postponed taxes at the lowered rate of 21 percent rather than the previous rate of 35 percent, per Politifact. Based out of Washington state, which has no income tax, Amazon has also been free from state filings on income. Marianne Dodson</description>

      <title>NASA rover finally bites the dust on Mars after 15 years...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA's Opportunity, the Mars rover that was built to operate just three months but kept going and going, was pronounced dead Wednesday, 15 years after it landed on the red planet. The six-wheeled vehicle that helped gather critical evidence that ancient Mars might have been hospitable to life was remarkably spry up until eight months ago, when it was finally doomed by a ferocious dust storm. Flight controllers tried numerous times to make contact and sent one final series of recovery commands Tuesday night along with one last wake-up song, Billie Holiday's "I'll Be Seeing You." There was no response from space, only silence.</description>
