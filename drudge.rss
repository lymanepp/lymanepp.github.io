The survey, conducted by San Francisco's Office of the Controller, found that 35% of respondents were either "very likely" or "somewhat likely" to move out of San Francisco in the next three years. Residents under the age of 35 were the most likely to want to leave and - no surprise here - renters were about twice as likely as homeowners to be thinking of bailing.</description>

      <title>Wall St sounding alarms. Her campaign thinks that's good news...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Wall-Street-is-sounding-alarms-over-Warren-Her-14816894.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finance titans keep piling on Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for her soak-the-rich tax plan. The 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful is relishing it.  Warren's campaign sent out a fundraising appeal Wednesday featuring headlines about Wall Streeters' laments, telling prospective donors the stories have "something in common: The wealthy and well-connected are scared. Scared that under a Warren Administration, they would finally have to pay their fair share." And the email said the ultrarich are "right to be scared."  The solicitation was the clearest signal yet that the Warren camp views her Wall Street critics as a useful foil for a bid framed around confronting runaway inequality and an entrenched political class. And they serve as bogeymen as the candidate takes heat from within her own party about the sweep and price tag of her $20.5 trillion plan to overhaul the U.S. health care system - a proposal that's drawn criticism from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in addition to her more moderate rivals in the field. (Former vice president Joe Biden is accusing Warren of being an "elitist" who is "condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.")  Warren's wealth tax "is extremely popular, so I don't think they needed this, but it's a huge bonus," one source close to the campaign tells me. "I don't actually think they anticipated people would be going on CNBC and crying. But they love it. These are the bad guys, and people out in the rest of the country think they're the bad guys. They're the only ones who think they're the good guys. They tell themselves that, and CNBC tells them that, but nobody else thinks so."  The cohort of financiers going public with their sky-falling claims about Warren's economic program continues to grow. Just this week:  - David Rubenstein - the billionaire...</description>

      <title>Surgeon implants electrodes in patient's brain to cure opioid use...</title>
      <link>https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Surgeon-implants-electrodes-in-patient-s-brain-in-14814847.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.seattlepi.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A surgeon has implanted electrodes in the brain of a patient suffering from severe opioid use disorder, hoping to cure the man's intractable craving for drugs in the first such procedure performed in the United States.  The device, known as a deep brain stimulator, is designed to alter the function of circuits in the man's brain. It has been used with varying degrees of success in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, dystonia, epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder and even depression. It is seen as a last resort therapy after the failure of standard care, such as medication that reduces the craving for drugs.  The deep brain stimulator, which functions much like a heart pacemaker, was implanted by Ali Rezai, executive chairman of the West Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute. His patient, 33-year-old hotel worker Gerod Buckhalter, said he had been unable to remain sober for more than four months since the age of 15, despite trying a variety of medications and other inpatient and outpatient treatments.  Buckhalter is the first of four people in a pilot program, which aims to demonstrate that the technique is safe so that a full-scale clinical trial can be conducted. It is aimed at a small percentage of opioid abusers with the most treatment-resistant cravings for opioids, who may face a lifetime of overdoses, relapses, inability to hold a job and other consequences of addiction.  The seven-hour surgery was performed Friday and the school announced it Tuesday.  "I'm not advocating for deep brain stimulation as a first line or a second line [treatment]," Rezai said. "It's for people who have failed everything, because it is brain surgery."  Rezai's surgical team opened a hole in Buckhalter's skull about the size of a nickel, then inserted four wires into his nucleus accumbens, a part of the brain's...</description>
