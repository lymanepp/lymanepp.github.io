      <title>BIDEN WARNS TRUMP:  YOU WON'T DESTROY ME</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Biden-counterpunch-tries-to-turn-attention-to-14495561.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden on Saturday sought to take a more aggressive tone in combating President Donald Trump, a shift in strategy amid signs of worry among campaign donors and supporters that his message is getting lost in an onslaught from the White House.  Biden wrote an op-ed that was published Saturday night in The Washington Post, attempting to refocus attention on Trump's impropriety in asking Ukrainian leaders to investigate Biden's family.  "Enough is enough. Every day - every few hours, seemingly - more evidence is uncovered revealing that President Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president," Biden wrote. "He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal political interests instead of the national interest."  "He does not understand the immense responsibility demanded of all those who hold the office of the president of the United States," Biden continued. "He sees only the power - and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump."  Biden's move came amid growing anxiety among Biden's supporters that he is unprepared to handle the dual challenges of running a general-election campaign against Trump while simultaneously facing an intensifying Democratic primary contest.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has started to eclipse him in several polls, and Biden last week reported raising only $15.2 million during the last quarter - nearly $10 million less than Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Biden's supporters also have bridled that Democrats have been slow to rush to Biden's defense.  Biden's campaign on Saturday night distributed a memo to reporters from deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield. The subject of the memo highlighted the twin challenges that one of the leading candidates has faced: "Biden...</description>
