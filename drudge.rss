      <title>Republicans decry trial as 'boring'...</title>
      <link>https://www.westport-news.com/news/article/Republicans-decry-impeachment-as-boring-in-an-15004299.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.westport-news.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Republicans adopted a new defense strategy this past week at President Donald Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate: boredom.  A top White House aide called the trial "unwatchable," Trump's campaign manager compared the proceedings to watching paint dry, and several Republican senators entertained distractions while downplaying the three-day prosecution as repetitive and unexciting. "They're really not bringing forth new information," Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said of the House impeachment managers Friday.  "I've not heard anything new," added Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla.  Barrasso and Scott were among 53 Republican senators who voted 10 times last week to block new evidence and witness testimony, effectively stripping the proceedings of potential novelty and allowing Trump's allies to publicly portray the trial as uninteresting and unimportant.  It's a defense strategy aimed at convincing the public that the third impeachment trial in American history is not worth their time while avoiding substantive questions about Trump's alleged misconduct, said Heather Cox Richardson, who teaches history at Boston College.  "It's definitely a strategy to try to get people to not pay attention," she said. "One of the reasons they're saying 'This is stupid and boring' is because they don't want people to watch."  Some lawmakers have openly shown their disdain for the process - reading books, playing with children's toys, filling out crossword puzzles or wandering from the Senate floor as House Democrats made their case for removing Trump from office.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has also taken care to ensure that it makes for unexciting television, at least in terms of production values. Often just one oddly tilted camera angle is used by cameras...</description>

      <title>2020 loser may not concede. Voters won't, either...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/The-2020-loser-may-not-concede-Their-voters-15002125.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the polls closed on Nov. 5, 2019,the initial count showed the governor of Kentucky, Republican Matt Bevins, losing to his Democratic challenger, Andy Beshear. But rather than concede that he fell short in what should have been an easy reelection, Bevins claimed that "irregularities" had muddled the result - producing no evidence to support his accusations. At first, some Kentucky legislative leaders appeared to back him, and some pointed to the legislature's power to resolve an election dispute and choose the governor regardless of the vote. But Bevins was not popular even within his own party, and eventually, he had to concede when the local GOP did not go along with him.  We could imagine a similar scenario this November: What would happen if President Donald Trump had an early lead that evaporated as votes were counted, and then he refused to concede? The idea isn't too far-fetched; Trump has raised it himself. Before the 2016 election, he wouldn't agree to accept the results if he lost. After winning in the electoral college but losing the popular count by about 3 million votes, Trump claimed - with no evidence whatsoever - that at least 3 million fraudulent votes had been cast for his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He set up an "election integrity" commission headed by then-Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach to try to prove that "voter fraud" is a major problem. But after the commission faced attacks from the left and the right for demanding state voter records with an apparent plan to use them to call for stricter registration rules, Trump disbanded it, with no work accomplished. In 2018, the president criticized elections in Florida and California, where late-counted votes shifted toward Democrats, suggesting without evidence that there was foul play.  It's not just Trump who might not accept election...</description>
