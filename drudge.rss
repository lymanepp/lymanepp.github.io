      <title>Documentary on Michael Vick seeks to add context to dogfighting saga...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/entertainment/article/ESPN-documentary-on-Michael-Vick-seeks-to-add-15016059.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;You don't have to forgive Michael Vick for dogfighting, but ESPN wants you to understand the context.  "Vick," a two-part "30 for 30" documentary set to air Jan. 30 with the second half premiering the following Thursday, Feb. 6, takes a deep dive into the factors that surrounded the former NFL quarterback's midcareer imprisonment, including race, poverty and sudden stardom and wealth. Among the complexities of his saga are the differing ways communities reacted to his arrest and lengthy sentence, and what to make of his football legacy.  Perhaps the biggest question, though, was raised by the documentary's director, Stanley Nelson, in a phone interview Wednesday with The Washington Post: "How does something that so many of us see as horribly cruel and torturous, how does anybody not see that?"  "And how, to some people, does this seem like something that's not wrong?" Nelson added. "So we wanted to examine that."  Unlike the recent Netflix series on former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, whose tale bears some similarities with Vick's - including a degree of misfortune in being drafted by teams located too close to their old stomping ground for their own good - the latter is alive to offer his take on what happened.  Vick, who has apologized numerous times and worked as an animal rights advocate since his 2009 release from prison, himself appears somewhat at a loss to explain it.  "I was really, really competitive, and I loved dogs," he says in the documentary, "and somehow, some way, that got intertwined, and I never got away from it, never walked away from it."  The "I loved dogs" line could have some viewers rewinding to make sure they heard it correctly, but Vick says it more than once, as do a pair of childhood friends and cohorts in Bad Newz Kennels, a dogfighting operation...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says he doesn't 'want to talk about a victory lap' regarding the coronavirus outbreak. 'But...' Ross during a Fox Business appearance Thursday morning discussed the Wuhan coronavirus, the death toll of which has reached 170 as more than 7,700 cases have been confirmed in mainland China. While Ross said that 'every American's heart has to go out to the victims' and 'I don't want to talk about a victory lap about a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,' his thought didn't end there. 'But the fact is, it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain,' Ross said. '...It's another risk factor that people need to take into account. So I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America, some to U.S., probably some to Mexico as well.' Host Maria Bartiromo, unphased by Ross' observation, quickly responded, 'Ah, that's a good point, actually. Yeah.' The Washington Post notes in response to this comment that 'White House officials so far have been careful in how theyâ€™ve talked about the economic implications of the health scare in China,' but Ross? Not so much.
