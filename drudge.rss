      <title>Tropical disturbance brewing near Florida; Hurricane may target Caribbean...</title>
      <link>https://www.thetelegraph.com/news/article/A-tropical-disturbance-is-brewing-near-Florida-14375757.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thetelegraph.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the mid-September peak of Atlantic hurricane season draws nearer, the tropics are heating up. A disturbance off the Florida coast is likely to become a tropical depression or storm in the coming days as it heads north but remains offshore.  Meanwhile, a second disturbance tracking toward the Caribbean was declared a tropical depression Saturday morning and is forecast to become a hurricane.  Should these tropical weather systems earn names, they will be called Dorian and Erin.  And it probably won't be long until there are others to keep an eye on.  The National Hurricane Center currently gives the system near Florida a 70 percent chance of developing into a tropical depression or tropical storm over the next 48 hours and a 90 percent chance in the next five days.  In its Saturday morning discussion, the Hurricane Center wrote that the disturbance is unlikely to strengthen Saturday given its proximity to land. But that's not the end of it.  "Environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development once the low moves off the east-central coast of Florida over the western Atlantic by Sunday," they wrote.  The main risks from the disturbance at present are rain related. Parts of South Florida could see downpours into Sunday. Some isolated flooding could result, although the most widespread torrential rain seems likely to stay offshore.  Computer models insist that whatever forms from this disturbance will not strike the United States. But as it is likely to parallel the coast between the U.S. and Bermuda, high waves, rip currents, and even some coastal flooding are possible along much of the Eastern Seaboard early next week.  What may become a more threatening system down the line is the tropical depression slowly marching toward the Caribbean Sea. This system is now...</description>

President 'hereby' orders U.S. business out of China. Can he do that?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Trump-hereby-orders-U-S-business-out-of-China-14374432.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's extraordinary edict demanding U.S. companies move out of China - delivered in a series of angry tweets Friday - left industries of every stripe scrambling to understand how seriously to take the order, and how the White House might enforce it.  Businesses from retail to electronics to home goods, many already under pressure from a months-long U.S.-China trade war, were contacting their industry associations for guidance and awaiting more substantive announcements from the White House.  "I'm trying to keep my cool and not get worried and upset, but it's becoming hard," said Margaret Raible, founder of Lite Gear Bags, a luggage maker based in Vallejo, California.  She has a meeting next week with an industry colleague to discuss moving more of her manufacturing from China to India or South Africa, she said. "I don't know how much faster I can move or how much more urgency I can have," she said.  Late Friday night, as he arrived in France for the G7, Trump suggested on Twitter he would be looking to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, signed into law in 1977, to follow up on his demand.  Trump does not have the authority to "duly order" companies to leave China, according to Jennifer Hillman, a Georgetown University law professor and trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.  But under the law he cited, Trump can prevent future transfers of funds to China, she said. First, he would have to make "a lawful declaration that a national emergency exists," she said.  Congress could terminate the declaration if it wishes, she said.  "Moreover, even if all this happened, it would not provide authority over all of the U.S. investments that have already been made in China," Hillman said.  Other trade experts said Trump does have powerful tools...</description>

      <title>Pennsylvania Dems regret not voting in '16 -- sure to cast ballot in 2020...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Some-Pa-Democrats-regret-not-voting-in-2016-14375503.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHILADELPHIA - The Rev. Alyn E. Waller, a senior pastor at Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church in Philadelphia, believes African American voters in his city hold the key to the White House.  After backing a Democrat for president since 1988, Pennsylvania swung behind Donald Trump in 2016, helping to propel him to the presidency with a dramatic turnout of supportive white voters while the turnout of black Democratic voters in urban areas fell.  Hillary Clinton easily won the vote in Philadelphia, but the drop-off from prior elections left her unable to offset white Republican votes coming from more rural and conservative parts of the state.  It was a moment not lost on Trump. During a rally in Pennsylvania in December 2018, he praised black Americans for staying at home. "They didn't come out to vote for Hillary," he said. "They didn't come out. And that was a big - so thank you to the African American community." He also has often lauded his rural supporters for their high turnout.  Overall, turnout of black voters fell from nearly 67 percent in 2012 - during the reelection of the nation's first African American president - to less than 60 percent in 2016 while the white percentage rose incrementally, according to a Pew Research study.  In Pennsylvania, exit polls showed, the percentage of the vote cast by African Americans, who overwhelmingly sided with Clinton, dropped from 13 percent in 2012 to 10 percent in 2016. White voters, who went dramatically for Trump, rose from 78 percent to 81 percent of the electorate.  Interviews with black and white voters in the state show that a different dynamic may already by in play - on both sides.  Arresting the slide in black turnout and cutting into Republican advantages among white and rural voters is seen by Democrats as key to...</description>
