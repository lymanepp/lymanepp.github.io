      <title>In Virginia, Republicans confront a fearful electoral future... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/In-Virginia-Republicans-confront-a-fearful-14822976.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RICHMOND, Va. - As Virginia election returns rolled in Tuesday night, Republican campaign manager Daniella Propati quickly realized two things: Her candidate for the House of Delegates, GayDonna Vandergriff, would lose, and calling their opponent a "socialist" hadn't worked.  North Richmond and the tony suburbs of Henrico County had once been a dependable backstop for the GOP, a place where statewide candidates found votes to offset Arlington and Alexandria. But the suburbs have undergone a metamorphosis in recent years - growing more socially liberal, more diverse, less interested in the red meat of the tea party and Donald Trump.  "Republicans - we've been running campaigns in Virginia the same way for 20 years," Propati said. "We need to come together and say, 'What do we need to do next time?' "  That's a question Republicans around the country are wrestling with after Tuesday's elections revealed new troubles in suburbs from Memphis to Philadelphia. Nowhere has the problem been more pronounced than in Virginia, where Republicans have been all but wiped from power in the past decade.  A GOP candidate hasn't won statewide office in Virginia since 2009. On Tuesday, Democrats gained majorities in both houses of the General Assembly for the first time in a generation; the House of Delegates swung from a 66-34 Republican edge in 2017 to a 55-45 Democratic advantage for next year's session.  In presidential elections, Virginia has moved so swiftly to the left in recent contests that it barely paused to be a swing state.  "This is the nightmare scenario for a lot of people in the Republican Party," said Ruy Teixeira, a demographer at the liberal Center for American Progress. "Virginia is an example of a possible future for some of the states that are now part of the...</description>

      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/America-s-billionaires-take-center-stage-in-14822820.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The political and economic power wielded by the approximately 750 wealthiest people in America has become a sudden flash point in the 2020 presidential election, as the nation's billionaires push back with increasing ferocity against calls by liberal politicians to vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.  On Thursday, Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire and former mayor of New York City, took steps to enter the presidential race, a move that would make him one of four billionaires who either plan to seek or have expressed interest in seeking the nation's highest office in 2020. His decision came one week after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., proposed vastly expanding her "wealth tax" on the nation's biggest wealth holders and one month after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said America should not have any billionaires at all.  The populist onslaught has ensnared Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, led to billionaire hand-wringing on cable news, and sparked a panicked discussion among wealthy Americans and their financial advisers about how to prepare for a White House controlled by populist Democrats.  Past presidential elections have involved allegations of class warfare, but rarely have those debates centered on such a small subset of people.  "For the first time ever, we are having a national political conversation about billionaires in American life. And that is because many people are noticing the vast differences in wealth and opportunity," said Timothy Naftali, a historian at New York University.  The growing hostilities between the ascendant populist wing of the Democratic Party and the nation's tech and financial elite have spilled repeatedly into public view over the past several months, but they reached a crescendo last week with news that Bloomberg may enter the Democratic primary....</description>

      <title>Farm family struggles to recover after rising debt pushes husband to suicide...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/A-farm-family-struggles-to-recover-after-rising-14822724.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PLATTE, S.D. - Amber Dykshorn stood at her kitchen window and watched the storm come in.  It was a very dark Saturday night in the middle of the summer in the middle of a year that is on track to be the wettest in more than a century. The wind blew over the farm, the rain came down and she heard the ominous pings on her roof - pea-sized hail, striking the still-fragile stalks of the only corn her husband, Chris Dykshorn, was able to plant before he took his own life in June.  Did their crop insurance cover hail damage? She had no idea. That was something Chris would have taken care of, if he were here. Instead she was alone, with nearly $300,000 in farm debt, three kids ages 5 to 13 and a host of grief-fueled questions. Why hadn't she been able to save him? What would happen to them now?  She scrolled through his final texts, rereading his words, leaning on the kitchen counter next to a whiteboard with the kids' chore list - Kahne: dishwasher, Kalee: dust living room - and a book someone gave her titled "Through a Season of Grief: Devotions for Your Journey from Mourning to Joy."  Chris had been despondent over the couple's finances, crippled by surplus grain he couldn't sell because of the trade war and flooded fields.  "I'm struggling so bad today. I don't know what to do anymore," he texted on May 31. "I seriously don't know how we r gonna make it."  On June 1: "I just want to sit in the house and cry."  And then: "What am I supposed to do. I am failing and feel like I'm gonna lose everything I've worked for the past how many years."  She was still asleep the morning of June 13 when he went to the utility room to get his gun.  In farm country, mental health experts say they're seeing more suicides as families endure the worst period for U.S. agriculture in decades. Farm...</description>

The solar system's smallest, innermost planet will resemble a tiny black dot Monday as it passes directly between Earth and the sun. It begins at 7:35 a.m. EST. The entire 5 ½-hour event will be visible, weather permitting, in the eastern U.S. and Canada, and all Central and South America. The rest of North America, Europe and Africa will catch part of the action. Asia and Australia will miss out.</description>
