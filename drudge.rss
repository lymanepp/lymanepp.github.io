      <link>https://www.chron.com/opinion/article/Farewell-to-Kellyanne-Conway-the-ultimate-Woman-15518830.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kellyanne Conway had a two-word weapon that she deployed with shrewd skill during her almost-four-year stint at the White House, and it left her targets defenseless.  Excuse me, she would say, needling a news anchor to permit her to barge into the conversation and take it in a more alternative-factsy direction.  Excuse me, she would say to fellow guests who tried, unsuccessfully, to join in with their own opinions. It was a filibuster of false manners, a prim reminder that she would not be yielding the floor.  "What if his spittle - excuse me - what if (Joe) Biden's spittle had gone beyond the teleprompters and everybody there was at risk?" she demanded, absurdly, at a news conference earlier this summer, turning attention away from President Donald Trump's own coronavirus failures. In a 2018 interview with Chris Cuomo regarding payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, she once excused herself a half-dozen times, all the while steamrolling a narrative that her boss was the real victim in the whole mess.  For Conway, "Excuse me" really meant "Excuse you." It was a shaming. It implied that the the other party was in the wrong for not permitting her bulldozing, browbeating and bloviating. It relied, successfully, on the assumption that nobody wanted to be seen interrupting a tiny blonde woman on live television. And so it excused her.  She is brilliant. She is terrifying.  She is also gone, theoretically. Earlier this week Conway announced she would be resigning from her role as senior adviser to the president. Her Wednesday speech at the Republican National Convention was a farewell of sorts, the last time we can expect to see her behaving as an official mouthpiece for Trump before she retreats to her new "less drama, more mama" lifestyle.  It was the hundredth anniversary of...</description>

      <title>Joe to troll with 2-minute ad set to run during renomination speech...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Biden-to-troll-Trump-with-2-minute-ad-set-to-run-15518989.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Biden isn't onstage this week as Republicans celebrate their presidential nominating convention. But his campaign is trying to make sure he's on TV.  That presence will come in the form of a two-minute television ad set to debut on broadcast and cable networks Thursday night, offering pricey counterprogramming intended to coincide with President Donald Trump's renomination speech.  The spot largely focuses on a positive message from Biden to America, including his plan to recover from the pandemic, interspersed with details of his biography. And it portrays the 77-year-old candidate as a vibrant and quick-paced campaigner at a time when Republicans are trying to paint him as a washed-up politician who is showing his age.  "Some people are always in a hurry," a narrator says in the opening scene, over a montage of Biden riding a bike, walking away from an Air Force plane, preparing to go onstage and jogging up a ramp.  "When Joe Biden is president, America is just going to have to keep up," the narrator says, citing Biden's plan to deal with the novel coronavirus and proposals to help working families get ahead.  The spot is largely gauzy and high-minded, but it's not entirely Mr. Nice Guy, with some footage designed to trigger Trump on his big day, even though the president is never mentioned by name.  At one point, as the narrator says that some people "race up steps when others take it slow" as a video shows Trump making an unsteady descent on a ramp after giving an address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in June. That's juxtaposed with video of Biden jogging up a similar ramp, from an address he gave at the academy.  (In case anyone misses the reference, a campaign news release accompanying the ad notes that the ad is being released as the general election...</description>

      <title>President mostly absent...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/934046/night-3-rnc-featured-conspicuous-lack-donald-trump</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where was President Trump on Wednesday night? The president loves the spotlight, and he doesn't much like to share it. It's why he was addicted to rallies before the pandemic, and why he did daily coronavirus briefings until his aides convinced him those performances were hurting him politically. Naturally, Trump's campaign announced he would speak all four nights of the Republican National Convention. The RNC is a TV show, and Donald Trump loves being on TV. That's how it worked the first two nights of the convention. The president played the role of a talk show host â€” popping up between speeches to grant live on-camera pardons and host a naturalization ceremony for immigrants becoming citizens. And then, on Wednesday, almost nothing. Trump was completely absent until a brief appearance at Fort McHenry at the end of the night after Vice President Mike Pence's speech. He never said a word. It was a decidedly un-Trumpian performance. So what gives? One possibility: Trump's use of the White House and his official powers during the convention came under widespread criticism on Wednesday, as pundits debated whether the Hatch Act â€” which prohibits executive branch employees from political activity â€” had become a dead letter. But it seems doubtful that the president, who never likes to admit a mistake or that his critics are right, would back down in the face of disapproval. Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff, openly scoffed at the naysayers earlier Wednesday. 'Nobody outside of the Beltway really cares' about the Hatch Act, he said. More likely: With Hurricane Laura bearing down on the Gulf Coast, with protesters shot and killed in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and with the NBA and other professional sports activities suddenly shutting down in protest of police violence, the president and his advisers may have decided it would look frivolous for him to be playing TV host. Wednesday was a bad day in America. Playing entertainer-in-chief would have been a bad look. The president will get back in front of cameras on Thursday, giving his official speech accepting the GOP's nomination for re-election. It never takes long for Donald Trump to find the spotlight.

      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/3-takeaways-from-the-third-night-of-the-15518001.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Republican National Convention held its third of four prime-time sessions on Wednesday night, with Vice President Mike Pence headlining and a younger generation of lesser-known Republicans featured on the undercard.  Below, some takeaways.  - - -  1. Pence's and others assurances about the private Trump  Picking up on a thread from first lady Melania Trump's speech on Tuesday night, a focal point Wednesday was assuring that, whatever the public appearance, President Donald Trump is a caring, empathetic and driven leader behind closed doors.  Pence noted that Trump has "certainly kept things interesting" and emphasized their difference in styles. But he said Trump's motivation is clear.  "Over the past four years, I've worked closely with our president. I've seen him when the cameras are off," Pence said. "Americans see President Trump in lots of different ways, but there's no doubt how President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is: a nation that has done more good in this world than any other, a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance. And if you want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted, then he's not your man."  The "grievance" line was particularly notable, given how much time Trump spends on such things.  White House officials Kellyanne Conway and Kayleigh McEnany both spoke of private moments with Trump. McEnany noted that Trump reached out to her when she underwent a preventive double mastectomy in 2018, before she became White House press secretary.  "As I recovered, my phone rang again," McEnany said. "It was President Trump calling to check on me. I was blown away. Here was the leader of the free world, carrying about my circumstance."  Conway spoke of Trump's empathy and attentiveness to those...</description>

      <title>Lara gets tripped up by Lincoln 'quote'...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Albert Einstein once notably stated, 'The problem with quotes you find on the internet is they are often untrue.' Lara Trump, President Trump's daughter-in-law, learned that the hard way on Wednesday night. During her speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump declared that Abraham Lincoln 'once famously said, 'America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.'' Last year, a Facebook meme crediting Lincoln with that statement went viral in right-wing circles, but both PolitiFact and Snopes have debunked it. Lincoln historian Christian McWhirter said this is a 'corruption' of something Lincoln said about 'the perpetuation of our political institutions' during a speech delivered in Springfield, Illinois, on Jan. 27, 1838. Lincoln asked the crowd, 'At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.' It turns out, Lincoln's words actually are eerily relevant today. Michael Burlingame of the University of Illinois Springfield explained to PolitiFact that Lincoln was 'denouncing mob violence which would lead to chaos, provoking the public to demand law and order, which would be provided by an ambitious leader who would rule tyrannically.'

      <title>Woman Possibly Cured of HIV -- Without Medical Treatment...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-Woman-May-Have-Been-Cured-of-HIV-Without-15516582.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A woman who was infected with HIV in 1992 may be the first person cured of the virus without a risky bone marrow transplant or even medications, researchers reported Wednesday.  In an additional 63 people in their study who controlled the infection without drugs, HIV apparently was sequestered in the body in such a way that it could not reproduce, the scientists also reported. The finding suggested that these people may have achieved a "functional cure."  The research, published in the journal Nature, outlines a new mechanism by which the body may suppress HIV, visible only now because of advances in genetics. The study also offers hope that some small number of infected people who have taken antiretroviral therapy for many years may similarly be able to suppress the virus and stop taking the drugs, which can exact a toll on the body.  "It does suggest that treatment itself can cure people, which goes against all the dogma," said Dr. Steve Deeks, an AIDS expert at the University of California, San Francisco, and an author of the new study.  The woman is Loreen Willenberg, 66, of California, already famous among researchers because her body has suppressed the virus for decades after verified infection. Only two other people - Timothy Brown of Palm Springs, California, and Adam Castillejo of London - have been declared cured of HIV. Both men underwent grueling bone marrow transplants for cancer that left them with immune systems resistant to the virus.  Bone marrow transplants are too risky to be an option for most people infected with HIV, but the recoveries raised hopes that a cure was possible. In May, researchers in Brazil reported that a combination of HIV treatments may have led to another cure, but other experts said more tests were needed to confirm that...</description>
