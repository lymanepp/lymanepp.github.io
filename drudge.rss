      <title>Census Bureau kicks off 2020 ad campaign amid fears about privacy and hacking...</title>
      <link>http://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Census-Bureau-kicks-off-2020-ad-campaign-amid-14975521.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Census Bureau on Tuesday unveiled an ad campaign to persuade every household in America to fill out the once-a-decade survey, which begins next week in remote parts of Alaska.  The decennial count of everyone living in the United States is used to determine a decade's worth of congressional apportionment, redistricting, and hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding. But a rising distrust of government, combined with the battle over whether to add a citizenship question and fears that the newly digital survey could be hacked, may make counting every person more difficult than ever.  Many of the 1,000-plus print, television, radio and Internet ads target immigrant and minority communities, which are traditionally among the hardest to count, and emphasize that data collected by the Census Bureau is confidential and cannot be shared, even with other government agencies.  Bureau Director Steven Dillingham, who will fly this week to Toksook Bay, Alaska, population about 660, to count the first person in the census, introduced the campaign in the District of Columbia, where placards displayed print and television ads, along with a coloring book about the census that will go to more than 117,000 schools across the nation.  In one Spanish-language television spot featuring young Hispanic men, one says he is worried it could be dangerous to fill out the form. Not at all, his friend assures him, saying he filled out the census 10 years ago and it was fine.  The campaign targets audiences in 13 languages, along with African Americans, Native Americans and children, who also are typically undercounted.  But some immigrant advocates said they were distressed that there was no mention in the ads of the citizenship question the Supreme Court blocked from the survey last...</description>
