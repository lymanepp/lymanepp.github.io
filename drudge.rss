      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The images rippled across the country: a forlorn pup, her muzzle and throat all pink like she had broken out in a rash.  Her name was Dani, the sheriff in Butler County, Ohio, said last week. A concerned citizen had found her abandoned on the side of the road on Aug. 17, he said.

The red marks around Dani's snout came not from duct...</description>
