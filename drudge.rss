      <title>What's probably not coming on Nov. 3? A result in race for White House...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Barring-a-landslide-what-s-probably-not-coming-15358093.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;After voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada went to the polls this month, some races hung in the balance for days as election officials waded through thousands of absentee ballots.  On Tuesday, a similar scenario is expected to play out in Kentucky and New York, where officials have already announced that some results will not be available for as long as a week.  In all five states, officials have contended with an avalanche of mail ballots as voters seek to avoid exposure to the novel coronavirus. It was a fresh illustration of how the pandemic is transforming the way elections are conducted in the United States.  It is also a stark preview of what's coming on Nov. 3 - or, more accurately, what may not be coming: an election night result in the race for the White House.  If voters remain reluctant to cast ballots in person, November is likely to bring an even more massive wave of voting by mail than what has swept across the country during primary season. That, in turn, means a close race between President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden in a pivotal state could take days, even weeks, to resolve, election officials across the country are warning.  Barring a landslide for either candidate, that scenario could invite an unprecedented test of the country's faith in its elections: an extended period without a declared winner. Amid that uncertainty, few expect Trump, who has said repeatedly that he thinks mail voting could cost him the election, to soothe voter anxieties.  On Monday, the president fired off tweets making unfounded assertions that voting by mail will cause massive fraud and allow foreign countries to manipulate the vote, echoing claims by his attorney general, William P. Barr.  "Because of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, 2020 will be the most RIGGED...</description>

      <title>Trump increasingly preoccupied with defending his physical, mental health...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Trump-increasingly-preoccupied-with-defending-his-15358423.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The early June meeting in the Cabinet Room was intended as a general update on President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, but the president had other topics on his mind.  Trump had taken a cognitive screening test as part of his 2018 physical, and now, more than two years later, he brought up the 10-minute exam. He waxed on about how he'd dazzled the proctors with his stellar performance, according to two people familiar with his comments. He walked the room of roughly two dozen White House officials and reelection staffers through some of the questions he said he'd aced, such as being able to repeat five words in order.  At the time, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment - which includes animal pictures and other simple queries aimed at detecting mild cognitive impairment such as dementia - was intended to quell questions about Trump's mental fitness. But in recalling it, Trump said he thought presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden would never be able to pass it and suggested challenging him to take the test, said the people familiar with Trump's comments, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private details.  The seeming non sequitur was part of Trump's growing preoccupation in recent weeks over perceptions of his mental and physical health at a time when critics have mocked him for episodes in which they say he has appeared frail or confused. The attacks Trump has previously levied against Biden - dismissing the former vice president as "Sleepy Joe," secreted away in his basement and enfeebled - have boomeranged back on him, as opponents have seized on Trump's own missteps to raise concerns.  Another sign of Trump's unease came Saturday night in Tulsa, Okla., when the president devoted more than 14 minutes to regaling a campaign rally crowd with the tale of "the ramp and the water." Eager to...</description>
