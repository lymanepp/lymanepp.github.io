      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Investigation-broadens-in-shooting-at-Naval-Air-14890151.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PENSACOLA, Fla. - FBI officials broadened their probe Saturday into the deadly shooting rampage at a Navy flight school here amid reports that several of the alleged gunman's Saudi compatriots took video footage as the killing spree was underway.  The shooting at the Naval Air Station Pensacola was labeled an act of terrorism by congressional officials, even as investigators continued to explore why a Saudi military student blasted his way through a classroom building early Friday, killing three people and wounding eight. The gunman, identified as Ahmed Mohammed al-Shamrani, was shot dead by a sheriff's deputy.  Law enforcement officials combed through the suspect's belongings and social media accounts on Saturday while questioning six other Saudi nationals, at least some of them fellow students in the same Navy flight training program. Three of the Saudis were said to have taken cellphone video at the scene, according to a U.S. official familiar with investigation. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal probe.  The FBI declined to ascribe a motive for the attack, and it was unclear Saturday whether any of the Saudis questioned had prior knowledge of the gunman's plans. Officials said they were investigating claims, first reported by the Associated Press, that al-Shamrani showed videos of previous mass shootings at a dinner party he hosted in the days before the attack.  There also was no official confirmation of a possible link between al-Shamrani and a Twitter account that surfaced Friday bearing the same name and containing a note in English criticizing U.S. support for Israel and accusing Washington of "funding crimes against Muslims."  The account, which was suspended by Twitter on Friday, did not express an allegiance to any particular extremist group. Law enforcement...</description>

      <title>Consequential choice -- limited or broad articles...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Democrats-face-a-consequential-choice-limited-14889490.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - House Democrats are heading into the final days of drafting articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump by reopening an internal debate that has roiled their caucus for more than six months.  Some Democrats, particularly the more liberal members of the House Judiciary Committee now writing potential articles, want to wrap in charges against the president linked to Russian interference in the 2016 election to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.  Ever since his report was released in the spring, these Democrats believe that Robert Mueller, who served as special counsel, painted a portrait of criminal behavior by Trump that at the least demonstrated an attempt to obstruct justice.  "The real question is whether we want to focus on a singular, discrete episode or focus on patterns of misconduct. And I do think we need to focus on patterns of misconduct, I think that the Constitution directs us to examine that," said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the Judiciary Committee.  To ignore the Mueller findings, Raskin and other liberals believe, is to let Trump escape condemnation for a pattern of behavior. "The misconduct that we saw with respect to the Ukraine shakedown was not some kind of aberration," he said.  Democrats will have an easier time writing charges against Trump for trying to pressure Ukraine's leaders into investigations that would have helped the president politically, an inquiry that all but two Democrats supported last month.  The evidence, produced in hearings before the House Intelligence Committee, has only gotten stronger since that vote, so Democrats are optimistic they have more than enough votes already to impeach Trump based on the Ukraine matter.  But any articles reaching beyond Ukraine would renew an old clash between...</description>

      <title>The season of Adam Driver has been decade in making...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/The-season-of-Adam-Driver-has-been-a-decade-in-14887321.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watching a scene primarily concerned with the dynamic between a film's protagonist and his romantic rival, a viewer might not expect the random guy in the corner to attract too much attention. And yet as Oscar Isaac and Justin Timberlake's characters in 2013's "Inside Llewyn Davis" record a novelty song begging President John Kennedy not to shoot them into outer space, it isn't just their harmonizing or the lyrics that make the bizarre tune work, but the manner in which their screenmate Adam Driver punctuates it with comical noises and refrains - "Outer ... space!" - delivered in his trademark baritone.  That's Driver in a nutshell, someone who, in part thanks to his large presence and general way of being, can't help but command the screen. HBO's "Girls," on which he broke out as the volatile Adam Sackler, even features a scene in which another character notes that he "does sort of look like the original man." The episode aired in 2012, early in a decade that proved to be star-making for the Oscar-nominated actor, and which he has capped with a robust fall slate: He stars as a lead in two films, "Marriage Story" and "The Report," and plays a villain in the upcoming holiday blockbuster "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker."  So how did the season of Adam Driver come to be? There's the aesthetic intrigue mentioned above that once led the Guardian to ask the lanky actor about "not being the standard Hollywood McHunk," to which he candidly responded, "I have been told before that I have an unusual face. But my face is my face." His success is likely due more to how that sense of grounded honesty comes through in his performances.  Driver, who trained at Juilliard after serving in the Marines, broadcasts a quiet intensity that can capture a range of feelings, sometimes all at once. In the earlier seasons of "Girls," for...</description>
