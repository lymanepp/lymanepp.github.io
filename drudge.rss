      <title>BALZ: For Dems, and for Republicans, a summer of discontent...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/For-Democrats-and-for-Republicans-a-summer-of-14278190.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has been a rough week for Republicans and for Democrats. As the long August recess begins, these are not happy times for either political party.  The Democratic presidential candidates put on two nights of debating in Detroit, producing maximum internal bickering and negativity and minimal positive or outward messaging to voters who will decide the 2020 election.  On the first night, the ideological split within the party broke wide open. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the two most left-leaning candidates on the stage, dominated their less-liberal rivals.  On the second night, the Democrats turned on one another, rather than President Donald Trump, and did so in smaller and less substantive ways than their colleagues on night one. Former Vice President Joe Biden bore the brunt of the attacks, though he was not alone. In the process, even former President Barack Obama took it on the chin at times.  Tuesday's session sparked a useful debate about what a post-Obama party should stand for and look like to attract as many voters as possible. But it raised obvious concerns about whether Democrats are veering too far to the left to win a general election against Trump. Wednesday session somehow managed to diminish virtually everyone onstage but didn't much change the nomination contest.  But presidential candidates aren't the only Democrats who are squabbling with one another. House Democrats, who should still be flush with the victory they engineered in the midterm election last November, are split down the middle over the biggest issue before them.  Should they start an impeachment inquiry against the president, as half their caucus now favors? Or, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., prefers, should they hold back indefinitely, or at least until they have more public support and more grounds...</description>

Dozens of aspiring festivalgoers stormed the gates at Lollapalooza, hopping over the fence en masse.

      <title>Paramount and paranoid: China's Xi faces crisis of confidence...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Paramount-and-paranoid-China-s-Xi-faces-a-crisis-14278079.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHANGHAI - Chinese scholars and Communist Party cadres have a succinct way of describing the tectonic shifts taking place here: Deng Xiaoping made us rich, now Xi Jinping is making us strong.  The phrase sums up China's economic rise that began under Deng four decades ago, and the hopes for a similarly significant geopolitical realignment under the current president.  Xi has devoted his seven years in power to strengthening the ruling Communist Party, and by extension the country. He has relentlessly quashed dissent, sidelined rivals and demanded absolute loyalty.  After pledging to make the party "north, south, east and west," he has ensured that it is paramount not just in policymaking but in the military, business, education and the law.  Now, Xi is facing challenges on multiple fronts and the Communist Party, riven with paranoia at the best of times, is seeing threats at every turn.  He has to contend not just with a slowing economy but also a protracted trade war with the United States, that has entered a new confrontational phase with President Donald Trump's decision to impose more tariffs next month.  He is facing escalating Western criticism of Chinese policies toward ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang, where as many as 3 million people have been put into reeducation camps. He is dealing with an increasingly assertive Taiwan at the same time as a pro-democracy movement swells in Hong Kong.  All of these loom as dangers to Xi's authority as the party's general secretary and are heightening a sense of alarm within a party long fearful of external threats.  "A strong party is the key to a successful China, in Xi's eyes. It is also the only way to fend off enemies abroad, most notably the U.S.," said Richard McGregor, an expert on the party and the author of a new book about...</description>

      <title>Republican anxiety spikes after retirements, Dem gains in Texas...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/GOP-anxiety-spikes-after-retirements-Democratic-14277128.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Republicans have long idealized Texas as a deep-red frontier state, home to rural conservatives who love President Donald Trump. But political turbulence in the sprawling suburbs and fast-growing cities are turning the Lone Star State into a possible 2020 battleground.  "The president's reelection campaign needs to take Texas seriously," Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in an interview. He added that while he remains optimistic about the GOP's chances, it is "by no means a given" that Trump will carry Texas - and win its 38 electoral votes - next year or that Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, will be reelected.  For a state that once elevated the Bush family and was forged into a Republican stronghold by Karl Rove, it is an increasingly uncertain time. Changing demographics and a wave of liberal activism have given new hope to Democrats, who have not won a statewide elected office since 1994 or Texas' presidential vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976.  Recent Republican congressional retirements have stoked party concerns, particularly the surprising Thursday announcement by a rising star, Rep. Will Hurd, that he would not seek reelection in his highly competitive district, which stretches east from El Paso along the Mexican border.  Days earlier, Rep. K. Michael Conaway, a powerful former committee chairman from West Texas, announced that he would not run again, as did Rep. Pete Olson, who narrowly won his seat in 2018. Two years earlier, Olson carried his suburban, Houston-area district by 19 percentage points.  Hurd, the lone black Republican in the House, said Trump's incendiary rhetoric on immigration amid a humanitarian crisis at the border has left him and other Texas Republicans unsettled about the GOP's future with minority voters.  "When you look at trends, the two largest...</description>
