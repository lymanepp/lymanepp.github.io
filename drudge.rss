      <title>2020 loser may not concede. Voters won't, either...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/The-2020-loser-may-not-concede-Their-voters-15002125.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the polls closed on Nov. 5, 2019,the initial count showed the governor of Kentucky, Republican Matt Bevins, losing to his Democratic challenger, Andy Beshear. But rather than concede that he fell short in what should have been an easy reelection, Bevins claimed that "irregularities" had muddled the result - producing no evidence to support his accusations. At first, some Kentucky legislative leaders appeared to back him, and some pointed to the legislature's power to resolve an election dispute and choose the governor regardless of the vote. But Bevins was not popular even within his own party, and eventually, he had to concede when the local GOP did not go along with him.  We could imagine a similar scenario this November: What would happen if President Donald Trump had an early lead that evaporated as votes were counted, and then he refused to concede? The idea isn't too far-fetched; Trump has raised it himself. Before the 2016 election, he wouldn't agree to accept the results if he lost. After winning in the electoral college but losing the popular count by about 3 million votes, Trump claimed - with no evidence whatsoever - that at least 3 million fraudulent votes had been cast for his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He set up an "election integrity" commission headed by then-Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach to try to prove that "voter fraud" is a major problem. But after the commission faced attacks from the left and the right for demanding state voter records with an apparent plan to use them to call for stricter registration rules, Trump disbanded it, with no work accomplished. In 2018, the president criticized elections in Florida and California, where late-counted votes shifted toward Democrats, suggesting without evidence that there was foul play.  It's not just Trump who might not accept election...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently President Trump thought we hadn't had enough Star Trek spinoffs for one year. After literal years of anticipation, President Trump debuted a logo for the 'Space Force' he's been touting his entire presidency. It's none of the adorable logos he asked Trump email subscribers to vote on about a year and a half ago, but instead a near-exact replica of the Starfleet Command logo from Star Trek. After consultation with our Great Military Leaders, designers, and others, I am pleased to present the new logo for the United States Space Force, the Sixth Branch of our Magnificent Military! pic.twitter.com/TC8pT4yHFT â€” Donald J.

      <title>New Hero of the Left: Judge Napolitano...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Democrats-have-a-new-impeachment-hero-Fox-News-15001227.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the Senate reconvened Thursday for President Donald Trump's historic impeachment trial, a name began trending on Twitter among those pushing for the president's removal from office: Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano.  Better known as Judge Napolitano or Judge Nap, the conservative commentator was once a Trump supporter and purveyor of conspiracy theories. But recently, Napolitano has shifted his stance on the president, voicing criticisms of Trump that are often at odds with the views of his fellow Fox News personalities.  Napolitano's deviation from Fox News's normally pro-Trump opinion programming continued this week when the former New Jersey Superior Court judge published an opinion piece pushing back against the president's repeated claims that the impeachment proceeding is a "hoax."  Napolitano described the proceedings as "deadly serious business based on well-established constitutional norms." He also made a case for why he believes there is "ample and uncontradicted" evidence for the Senate to vote to remove the president, writing that there are "valid, lawful, constitutional arguments for Trump's impeachment that he ought to take seriously."  The op-ed appeared to have been first published Wednesday by the Washington Examiner, a conservative news outlet, before it showed up on Fox News's site early Thursday.  "What is required for removal of the president?" Napolitano wrote. "A demonstration of presidential commission of high crimes and misdemeanors, of which in Trump's case the evidence is ample and uncontradicted."  This is not the first time that Napolitano has pushed for Trump's impeachment in recent months, nor is his stance all that surprising, given that he has been described as a "staunch libertarian" who "places principles over partisanship, and who is outspoken and critical without...</description>
