      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump at a campaign-style event in Oshkosh, Wisconsin on Monday: "So, we have to win the election. We can't play games. Get out and vote. Do those beautiful absentee ballots or just make sure your vote gets counted. Make sure, because the only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged. Remember that. It's the only way we're going to lose this election... This is more than this election. That's a big statement. The only way they're going to win is that way, and we can't let that happen. And, you know, our post office, we're going to make our post office great. It's been a disaster for many years. We're going to take care of the men and women in the post office, and we're going to make it great. Right now, it's a laughingstock."</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at the 2020 Democratic Convention. Sanders says that "by rejecting science," President Trump has "put our lives and health in jeopardy" and "fanned this pandemic." "Ideas that were once considered radical only a few years ago are now considered mainstream," Sanders said.  "My friends, the price of failure us just too great to imagine," Sanders said about the Biden/Harris ticket.</description>

      <title>Subtle handoff for 78-year-old senator...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/We-have-a-come-a-very-long-way-Bernie-Sanders-15490156.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Few people saw the beginning of Sen. Bernie Sanders's journey in presidential politics as a major moment - including Sanders himself.  "Let me just make a brief comment," the Vermont independent said as he spoke to a small group of reporters outside the Capitol in April 2015. "We don't have an endless amount of time."  Since then, everything and nothing has changed.  "We have come a very long way in five years," Sanders said in an interview Sunday, chuckling as he recalled his modest start, which focused on the power of the "billionaire class."  Sanders's address at the Democratic National Convention on Monday night effectively closed an improbable odyssey - two bids for the White House that together formed the backbone of a new, insurgent liberal movement.  Sanders nodded to his success in lifting his previously fringe calls for Medicare-for-all, free college tuition and a chastening of the nation's financial elite to the fore of a Democratic Party that had been drifting toward more-centrist views.  "Many of the ideas we fought for, that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream," Sanders said in his address, speaking from Burlington, Vt.  He cast President Donald Trump as a historic failure - a "threat to our democracy" who is "leading us down the path of authoritarianism."  "Nero fiddled while Rome burned," Sanders said. "Trump golfs. His actions fanned this pandemic, resulting in over 170,000 deaths and a nation still unprepared to protect its people."  Any bitterness about his defeat in the primary to presumptive nominee Joe Biden was absent. This phase of his revolution was televised and unified, with Sanders urging his supporters to back Biden.  "My friends, I say to you, to everyone who supported other candidates in the primary and to those who...</description>

      <title>Trump says coronavirus is 'God testing me'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/931752/trump-says-coronavirus-god-testing-build-economy-again</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump on Monday blasted his likely presidential challenger former Vice President Joe Biden during a speech in Manakato, Minnesota, saying he'd 'abolish the American way of life' en route to turning the U.S. into a 'very boring socialist country that will go to hell.' He then had a go at Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), for co-sponsoring a 'socialist takeover of health care.' The president also joked the coronavirus pandemic was 'God testing me' to rebuild the U.S. economy a second time. He zeroed in on New Zealand, a country which, to Trump's apparent chagrin, has won praise for containing the virus. Recently, though, New Zealand has had a flare-up, and Trump made sure the crowd in Minnesota knew about it. While New Zealanders are certainly concerned about the virus resurfacing after several months, just nine new infections were reported Monday, far lower than the average daily number of cases in the United States, which Trump maintains has handled the pandemic with aplomb. 'All of a sudden a lot of the places they were using to hold up, they are having a big surge ... New Zealand, you see what's going on in New Zealand' -- New Zealand had nine (9!) new Covid cases today. The US had more than 42,000. The outbreaks are not comparable. pic.twitter.com/T8ugmKK6aa â€” Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) August 17, 2020 The speech also included a defense of the Minneapolis Police Department, which has come under fire in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, and criticism of the Minneapolis protests. 'The city was ablaze,' he lamented. Tim O'Donnell Trump says this of Minneapolis cops: 'The police department is very good but they were told you can't do anything. They have to be able to do what they do very well.' (Recall that people were protesting in Mpls after George Floyd was killed by a cop.) pic.twitter.com/nQJZp9P3a0 â€” Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) August 17, 2020</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Europe-clamps-down-on-nightlife-to-regain-grip-on-15489772.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Europe is tightening some restrictions on public life again as summer partying risks reigniting the spread of the coronavirus.  Wary of returning vacationers spreading covid-19 at workplaces and schools, European officials are caught between fostering an economic recovery and the threat of a widespread outbreak.  The concerns prompted Spain and Italy to shut discos and Greece to restrict hours for bars and restaurants in hopes of avoiding more stringent measures after the holiday season winds down.  "We cannot waste the sacrifices made in the past months," Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza said in a Facebook post. The government also made wearing face masks compulsory from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in public venues and in outdoor spaces, including squares and streets, where crowds can gather.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed the sentiment, telling a meeting of her CDU party in Berlin that rising infections are of concern and there is no scope currently for loosening restrictions.  Spain has again emerged as a hot spot, with a 1,833 new infections in the last 24 hours, according to Health Ministry data published Monday.  By comparison, Italy -- the original epicenter of the outbreak on the continent -- reported 320 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the lowest increase in a week. Even so, the number of active Italian patients continued to climb to 14,867.  Irish authorities are considering new measures to curb the pandemic.  In addition to outbreaks at food-processing plants, concern is mounting around potential contagion in bars following a weekend video of a Dublin barman standing on a counter to pour shots into customers' mouths. Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Ronan Glynn described such scenes as "reckless."  "The next three weeks are incredibly important," Irish Health...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's safe to say we know which Republican isn't about to back presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. A spokesperson for former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Monday confirmed to Bloomberg News that he isn't the former Republican member of Congress preparing to offer an endorsement of Biden. This clarification came after former Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) teased that an unidentified former GOP congressman would soon be breaking with his party to back Biden over President Trump. Immediately, one of the prime suspects on Twitter was Boehner. But according to a spokesperson, there's 'nothing to see here' because the former House speaker would 'rather set himself on fire than get involved in the election,' per Bloomberg's Billy House. Boehner spox on speculation he might be the Republican set to endorse Biden: 'The answer is no. I think heâ€™d rather set himself on fire than get involved in the election. Nothing to see here.' â€” Billy House (@HouseInSession) August 17, 2020 Boehner retired from Congress in 2015 and has since exuded a 'boy, am I glad I'm not a part of this anymore' energy in interviews, sometimes enjoying a cocktail while doing so. As some Republicans get behind Biden this year, including Kasich, it seems we should hardly expect a tearful endorsement from Boehner anytime soon, as he would quite prefer to be left out of this, thank you very much.

      <title>Restaurant workers worry about safety  -- and their livelihoods...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Facing-unmasked-diners-and-sick-colleagues-15489169.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On June 17, Jennifer Moreau received a text that said Senate Blue Ash, the suburban Cincinnati restaurant where she worked as a cook, would be closed the following day. All employees would be required to get tested for the coronavirus on their day off, the owner and executive team wrote. According to the restaurant, a line cook had just tested positive.  "Obviously discretions [sic] is key so please refrain from related posts on social media, as it would affect all of our livelihoods," the text explained, according to a screenshot Moreau shared with The Washington Post.  Moreau dutifully got tested but didn't visit the recommended clinic. She found one closer to her home. Moreau thought it also provided same-day results. It didn't. Executive chef Leroy Ansley, who declined to comment for this story, was not happy. He exchanged texts with Moreau, which she shared with The Post, indicating that her decision had put him in a bind, as the restaurant reopened on June 19 with less than half its kitchen staff. Ansley even sent Moreau a photo of chef and co-owner Daniel Wright in a black mask.  "I have to have Dan come in and peel potatoes," Ansley texted. "It is what it is."  Moreau, 49, never returned to Senate Blue Ash.  She had reasons, starting with her son, Alex Allen, who was a cook at a sister restaurant and who tested positive for the coronavirus on June 23. Even though she tested negative, Moreau was required to quarantine for two weeks because she lives in the same house with her son. But Moreau was also put off by the way Queen City Hospitality Group, the parent of Senate Blue Ash, handled the situation. She didn't like the social media blackout on the restaurant's positive employee. She worried, too, the workplace wasn't safe after a 24-hour shutdown and a round of rapid-response tests, which have a 20 percent...</description>

      <title>KASICH:  I'm Conservative And I Will Make Case For Biden...</title>
      <link>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/08/15/kasich_im_a_conservative_republican_and_i_will_make_the_case_for_biden_at_the_dnc.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Gov. John Kasich (R-OH), who describes himself as a conservative Republican, said he will make the case for a Joe Biden presidency at the Democratic National Convention. " DON LEMON, CNN HOST: An unexpected phase to take part in the Democratic National Convention and it will certainly anger some on the right. Former Ohio governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate John Kasich to speak in support of Joe Biden possibly on the same night as Bernie Sanders and Michelle Obama. Governor Kasich is a CNN senior commentator and he joins me now. Governor, good evening to you. Thank you so much. JOHN KASICH, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Thanks, Don. LEMON: You've been critical of President Trump since the very beginning. And you've even supported his impeachment. But going with a Democratic candidate for president is a whole different ball game. How did you get to this point? KASICH: Conscience, Don. You know, you and I have done a lot of shows together. And you know at the end I hope you know this, that I try to follow my conscience in terms of what seems right to me. And you know, I didn't support Trump the last time because I was on the debate stage with him, I watched him. And I was afraid he was going to be a divider not a unifier. Somebody that would go out of his way to be critical of people and the other party or didn't think the way he did. And unfortunately, it turned out to be right. So, I look around and I say now what? We can't continue to go down this path. It's -- I mean, people are now speaking to each other if they disagree with them with through clenched teeth. There's almost hatred going on. This has to stop because the great things that happened in our country whatever they are, women suffered, civil rights, they happen when we come together not when we're divided. So I felt that Joe Biden would be a unifier and he would stop this division and we could get back to, you know, sort of a civil conversation, it could be arguments, it could be strong but at the end of the day, I think that he will include people, not exclude them and stop the name calling. LEMON: OK. So, listen, I just got back from vacation. I only have so much bandwidth. But just, 2016, I know that you did not support Trump. Did you support -- did you vote or support -- you don't have to tell me voted for because I think that's your personal thing. KASICH: No, I voted for -- I wrote in John -- (CROSSTALK) LEMON: OK. KASICH: I wrote in John McCain. LEMON: So that's why I was -- I didn't -- I couldn't recall exactly how you played it. KASICH: Yes. LEMON: So, this time you think it's -- it is just more of a pro-Biden or an anti-Trump vote or what? What are you saying? KASICH: No, it's not. It's time for a switch. And I think it's fine for -- look, I'm a Republican. I'm not going to change my party. I've been a conservative Republican. But I've had enough of this. I've had enough of the division and everything else, and not getting anything done. So, to just sit it out again and say well I'm not going to be for Trump and not lend my support to somebody, I -- it doesn't make sense for me this time around. And I actually believe, I've known Joe. I've known him for 30 years. I know the kind of guy he is. Now I'm not going to agree with him on everything, Don. And probably he gets to be president I'll be on here with you and I'll be talking about the things that I don't agree with him on. But I think as a leader as a person that can bring us together at a time when this dysfunction, I mean, your whole show tonight is all about the dysfunction of what we're getting from the executive branch. It has to stop. And our best days are when we work together, not when we fight and divide each other. That's where we need to go. You know, remember, a book team of rivals about Abraham Lincoln about how he invited people in his cabinet that he had fought with and didn't agree with, that's the American way, not this way. If you don't agree with me, you're out the door or I'll call you a name or whatever, that's crazy.</description>

      <title>As Dems demand DeJoy testify, protesters picket his homes...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/As-the-House-demands-an-interview-with-Postal-15488875.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A crowd of hundreds blasted sirens outside Louis DeJoy's Washington apartment building early on Saturday morning, sliding mock blank ballots behind the iron gates. The next day in Greensboro, N.C., dozens more protesters blocked the leafy street to the postmaster general's mansion, clapping to the tune of a banjo and carrying signs that read "Stay out of our boxes."  Hours later, as fears escalated that DeJoy's cost-cutting changes could delay ballots in November, Democratic lawmakers summoned him to testify at an emergency hearing.  DeJoy, who was named to head the U.S. Postal Service in May, and his wife, Aldona Wos, have for decades worked behind the scenes to raise millions for candidates like President Donald Trump and former Gov. Pat McCrory, R-N.C. But over the weekend, the GOP power couple found themselves at the nexus of public anger over fears that Trump is interfering with the November election by crippling the Postal Service.  "We're in the middle of a historic pandemic and as many as 40% of Americans plan on casting their ballot by mail," Patrick Young, an organizer with the group Shut Down D.C. told WUSA. "If we can't rely on those ballots getting to where they need to go, we've got a serious problem with democracy."  It is unclear if DeJoy or Wos were at either residence during the demonstrations this weekend; a spokesperson for the Postal Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  As The Washington Post has reported, DeJoy has upended the mail system months before it is expected to serve as the main conduit for millions of mail-in ballots, as voters seek to avoid polling places during the coronavirus pandemic. In the past week alone, he fired or reassigned several agency leaders and ordered the removal of hundreds of high-speed mail-sorting machines critical to maintain processing...</description>

      <title>Exotic dancer, nuclear engineer, QAnon enthusiast, Laura Loomer: GOP race to represent Trump's Palm Beach district...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/An-exotic-dancer-a-nuclear-engineer-a-QAnon-15488787.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PALM BEACH, Fla. - In a congressional race where an acolyte of Roger Stone who's been banned by Twitter and Facebook may not even be the most unconventional candidate, voters in the Republican primary for Florida's 21st Congressional District have a rich array of choices.  The six people competing in the Aug. 18 primary include a former burlesque dancer and wild animal exhibitor who did business in the same circles as "Tiger King" Joe Exotic; a Palm Beach neighbor of Mar-a-Lago who is supported by QAnon believers; and Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator and anti-Islam activist who calls herself "the most banned woman on the Internet" and who once handcuffed herself to the front door of Twitter's office in New York.  There's also an ex-cop, a nuclear engineer-turned college professor and a retired investigator for the IRS.  Among the constituents they hope to represent: the president and first lady. The Trumps registered as Republicans in Palm Beach County in October when President Trump changed his official domicile from Manhattan to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach. They both voted by mail in the March presidential primary.  All six candidates are political newcomers running in a heavily Democratic district that covers Palm Beach, West Palm Beach and parts of Broward County. One of them will face Lois Frankel, a Democrat who ran unopposed two years ago, or her primary opponent, Guido Weiss, a former legislative assistant for Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.  Regardless of their long shot chances of winning the congressional seat in the fall, the GOP candidates are being scrutinized due to Trump's decision last year to call the district home.  Loomer's campaign manager is Karen Giorno, who was a senior political adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016. She said the president's team wants the congressional seat - which...</description>
