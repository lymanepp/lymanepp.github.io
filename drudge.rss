      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BERLIN (AP) — Scientists in Switzerland have found a way to make brown chocolate colorful, without adding further ingredients. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology said Thursday that researchers discovered a method to imprint a special structure on the surface of chocolate that makes it shimmer and shine like a rainbow. The university said the process mimics the effect of chameleon skin, which can change to display specific colors. It said the rainbow chocolate is ready for industrial production and the scientists are already in talks with big chocolate makers. ___ Video: https://youtu.be/l3ZFZ_ApzGY</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who would have taken President Trump for a box office prognosticator? He briefly became one with a gaffe at his Wednesday night rally occurring at the same time that the House of Representatives passed articles of impeachment charging him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The president meant to declare that Democrats will experience a backlash in the 2020 election as a result, but instead, he briefly got the worlds of entertainment and politics all mixed up. 'They'll receive a big backlash at the box office,' Trump said of House Democrats, clearly trying to casually correct himself moments later by referencing 'that ballot box on November 3rd' as if that's what he said the first time. Then again, if Trump did mean box office, it wouldn't be out of line after his declaration in August that 'Hollywood is racist' and that 'what they're doing with the kind of movies they're putting out, it's actually very dangerous to our country.' Or perhaps he was actually taking about the Democrats' decision to hold a presidential debate on the opening night of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, predicting a huge surge in ticket sales from those who are specifically choosing not to tune in. As Trump might say, who can figure out the true meaning of the box office comment? Enjoy! Brendan Morrow Pres. Trump: House Democrats 'look like a bunch of foolsâ€¦Theyâ€™ll receive a big backlash at the box office.â€� https://t.co/O9l3h6v4WW pic.twitter.com/3mxqYeprIi â€” ABC News (@ABC) December 19, 2019</description>

      <title>Authorities find 'monkey dungeon' in zoo...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Va-authorities-find-a-monkey-dungeon-in-a-zoo-14918185.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a U.S. Department of Agriculture animal welfare inspector visited Wilson's Wild Animal Park this summer, she identified no violations. The federal inspection report for the Virginia zoo, home to about 200 exotic and barnyard animals, was pristine.  But that is not what local law enforcement officers found the very next day. Sent by the state attorney general, their observations triggered a search one week later by a team of veterinarians, zoologists and law enforcement officers. They discovered an array of problems, according to later court testimony, including a pony with a swollen face, maggot-covered meat in the tiger cage, and what a prosecutor described as a "monkey dungeon."  The search team seized 119 animals whose lives they deemed to be in danger. Last month, zoo owner Keith Wilson and an employee were each charged under Virginia law with 46 counts of animal cruelty.  The chasm between the USDA and local assessments is a stark illustration of a dramatic decline in federal animal welfare enforcement amid a Trump administration deregulation push. From 2016 to 2018, the number of citations issued by the USDA to about 10,000 zoos, circuses, breeders and research labs it regulates dropped by 65 percent. The agency attributes the drop in citations, which can lead to fines and revoked licenses, to new efforts to work closely with businesses and their veterinarians to correct violations. Former employees have said it's the result of a more lenient approach that puts animals at risk.  Wilson's was among the facilities the USDA stopped citing. For years, inspectors documented numerous violations there, including a lion enclosure with walls too short to prevent the cats' escape and a concrete-floored bear pen with little more than a tire swing for entertainment. Since mid-2018, the zoo's three reports have been...</description>

      <title>Three-month battle tested political will of both parties...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Three-month-battle-tested-the-political-will-of-14917367.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sat quietly at the head of the long table inside her ornate conference room early this month, listening as her deputies debated the last major decision in the impeachment of President Donald Trump.  Her senior lieutenants argued for an expansive bill of charges encompassing the Mueller report. Others pressed for articles of impeachment focused solely on Trump's pressure on Ukraine to help his reelection bid.  Ultimately, it didn't matter. Pelosi had all but made up her mind.  Two days earlier, while she was in a Madrid hotel for a climate conference, Pelosi took a call from anxious moderate members of her Democratic caucus who were feeling heat in their home districts about supporting impeachment. The speaker, they said, should resist liberal calls to expand the investigation.  Pelosi did not tip her hand on the call. But it was a compelling argument from her "majority makers," the group whose members flipped pro-Trump districts in 2018, helping make Pelosi speaker for the second time, and have guided her thinking from the earliest moments of the three-month impeachment saga.  "It was not much of a debate," Pelosi, D-Calif., recalled in an interview Tuesday. "When we made our decision to go forward, there was no opposition to it."  The back and forth was a closing snapshot of how Democrats proceeded toward Wednesday's momentous vote to impeach Trump on two counts, abusing his power and obstructing Congress. While the Democrats voted almost entirely in lockstep, and the outcome was never truly in doubt, the result belied an emotional and often caustic behind-the-scenes drama that exposed - and at times exacerbated - divisions within the House Democratic caucus.  The experience tested the will of centrist Democrats from pro-Trump...</description>

      <link>https://www.theweek.com/speedreads/885238/trump-implies-rally-that-late-democratic-rep-john-dingell-hell</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump wasn't happy that Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) voted to impeach him, and went low with his response. As the House of Representatives voted on Wednesday night, Trump was speaking to supporters at a rally in Battle Creek, Michigan. He asked the crowd if they knew Dingell, calling her a 'real beauty,' and then mentioned that after her husband, the late Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), died earlier this year, he offered to give the family 'A+ treatment' when it came to the state funeral. 'I didn't give him the B treatment,' Trump said. 'I didn't give him the C or the D. I could have.' He claimed that Debbie Dingell called him gushing, saying it was 'the nicest thing that's ever happened, thank you so much, John is looking down.' Trump said he told her not to worry about it, and then gave a cruel aside. 'Maybe he's looking up, I don't know,' he said. 'Maybe.' The crowd 'ooohed' like they were in the audience of Maury, and Trump added, 'Let's assume he's looking down.' Watch the video below. Catherine Garcia Trump laments that Debbie Dingell voted to impeach him despite the fact that he allowed the normal state funeral to proceed for her late husband, former Rep. John Dingell. Trump then suggests John Dingell is in hell -- to audible groans. pic.twitter.com/wsYfddNIA9 â€” Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 19, 2019</description>
