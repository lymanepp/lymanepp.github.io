      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.vanityfair.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even a virtual newsroom can be a hotbed for gossip, with long-running speculation about Dean Baquet’s successor upended amid Black Lives Matter protests and a pandemic. Marc Lacey now appears in the mix, though A.G. Sulzberger insists he’s “in no hurry” to make a change.</description>

      <title>POLL: Most think Feds making pandemic worse...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/935185/60-percent-americans-say-federal-governments-coronavirus-response-making-pandemic-worse</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The U.S.'s COVID-19 response has fallen far behind most of the rest of the world's â€” and many Americans think the federal government is largely to blame. In contrast to President Trump's false insistence that the U.S. has one of the world's lowest mortality rates from coronavirus, a New York Times analysis published Tuesday shows the U.S. actually accounts for more than its population's share of COVID-19 deaths. And Americans largely recognize the U.S.'s failures, with 60 percent of them saying the federal government's COVID-19 response is actually making the pandemic worse, an Axios-Ipsos poll has found. Just 39 percent of Americans say the federal government is making America's coronavirus recovery better, the poll found, though there's a sharp divide between parties. Only 19 percent of Democrats say the federal government is making things better, while 80 percent say things are getting worse. Independents largely agree, with 68 percent say the government isn't helping. Meanwhile 74 percent of Republicans say the federal government is improving things, while 25 percent say it's actively worsening the pandemic, the poll found. Beyond just his response, Americans don't even trust Trump to give them accurate information regarding the coronavirus, the Axios-Ipsos poll says. But things aren't much better for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden â€” 31 percent of Americans say they trust Trump for accurate COVID-19 information, while 46 percent say they trust Biden. The Axios-Ipsos poll surveyed 1,100 adults from Aug. 28-31, with a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>Costa Rica now allowing U.S. visitors -- but only from 12 places...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/lifestyle/article/Costa-Rica-is-now-allowing-U-S-visitors-but-15529599.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In March, Costa Rica imposed strict land and air border closures, effectively shutting U.S. travelers out of the small Central American nation. Beginning in waves this September, however, residents of 11 states and D.C. will be allowed to visit Costa Rica once again, with a negative coronavirus test result in hand.  Beginning Sept. 1, Americans with a valid state ID proving their residency in Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Virginia or D.C. can enter Costa Rica under the new terms.  Beginning Sept. 15, Americans with valid state IDs for Colorado, Massachusetts or Pennsylvania will also be permitted to enter under the new rules.  Costa Rica appears to be the first destination allowing Americans to visit based on their home state, and the tourism board says the list of authorized regions is being "revised periodically."  All visitors, regardless of their home country or state, will be required to have a negative coronavirus test result acquired within 72 hours before their flight. Travelers will also need to have proof of medical insurance and fill out a health form online, according to a statement by the Costa Rica Tourism Board.  "The entry of travelers from these 12 states is allowed because they currently have an epidemiological condition similar or lower levels of contagion to those of Costa Rica," Tourism Minister Gustavo J. Segura said in a news conference Thursday.  Visitors will be permitted to arrive through a connecting airport in another state as long as they do not leave the airport during their layover.  Costa Rica has not allowed U.S. travelers to enter since it imposed closures in March. On Aug. 1, the country began accepting some foreign nationals with a negative coronavirus test result, including Canadians and E.U. Schengen-zone residents. On Aug. 19, the...</description>

      <title>For first time in 160 years, Republican Party failed to produce policy platform...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/opinion/article/For-the-first-time-in-160-years-the-Republican-15526970.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the many different things about this election year is that the Republican National Committee, for the first time since 1856, did not bother to come up with a policy platform. Instead, according to the New York Times, they passed "a resolution renewing what delegates enacted in 2016, bashing the news media and offering wholehearted support for Mr. Trump." The Washington Post editorialized that the move was an implicit announcement by the Republicans "that they stand for nothing."  The policy section in Vice President Mike Pence's convention speech - the part where he bragged against all evidence about how well the administration handled the coronavirus - claimed that "America is a nation of miracles."  Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, on the other hand, has a page on his website containing 46 detailed policy papers (I was Biden's chief economist from 2009 to 2011 when he was vice president.) Along with a detailed, national plan for virus control, there are plans for manufacturing jobs, child and elder care, clean energy, affordable housing, health care, and much more. The Democratic platform covers those areas, too. To my knowledge, none of these plans depends on miracles.  I want to be very clear about this next part: While I'm bullish on Biden's agenda, you may not share my enthusiasm. But I surely hope you share my view that if there was ever a country that needed a plan, it's the United States today.  As of Sunday, the pandemic had infected almost 6 million Americans and killed nearly 180,000 of them. The unemployment rate, at 10.2 percent, remains above its peak during the last recession. Hurricane Laura reminded us that global warming is increasing the intensity of tropical storms. Police have yet again shot a Black American, leading to righteous outrage and protests.  And that was just last week's...</description>
