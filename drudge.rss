      <title>Shocking escalation from 'no symptoms to death' in just hours...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/900862/washington-nursing-home-coronavirus-outbreak-reported-shocking-escalation-from-no-symptoms-death</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The epicenter of Washington state's coronavirus outbreak has a disturbing status update. Life Care Center of Kirkland, Washington, outside of Seattle, has seen 15 of its residents die after contracting COVID-19, and dozens of its workers haven fallen ill. The center's remaining 55 residents are going to be tested for the virus, and while only six of them are currently sick, that doesn't necessarily mean good news, The New York Times reports. As the Times put it, Life Care 'had seen some residents go from no symptoms to death in just a matter of a few hours.' 'It was surprising and shocking to us that we have seen that level of escalation from symptoms to death,' said Tim Killian, a spokesperson for the nursing home. Efforts to contain the spread from Life Care aren't going well either, seeing as 70 of the center's 180 workers were out sick as of Sunday, but 'there weren't enough test kits yet for them,' the Times reports. Three of those workers had been hospitalized, and one of them tested positive for COVID-19. Washington state has reported 19 confirmed deaths from the new coronavirus, and 16 of them have been attributed to the nursing home. Washington has second highest number of both COVID-19 deaths and cases among all U.S. states, while New York has 142 cases and zero deaths. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>President retweets photo of himself fiddling...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/900761/trump-retweets-white-house-photo-fiddling-says-doesnt-know-what-means</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anybody else had tweeted a doctored photo of President Trump playing the fiddle as the new coronavirus spreads throughout the U.S. and wreaks havoc on the U.S. and global economies, the White House would probably protest vociferously. When White House social media director Dan Scavino tweeted out such a photo, saying Trump's next tune is 'Nothing can stop what's coming,' though, Trump retweeted it with the message: 'Who knows what this means, but it sounds good to me!'' Who knows what this means, but it sounds good to me! https://t.co/rQVA4ER0PV â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 8, 2020 Trump, of course, wasn't playing the violin over the weekend â€” he was playing golf at his private club in Florida. And since historical and cultural references to leaders fiddling are scarce, especially in times of disaster, lots of people on social media had no problem identifying what they believed the meme meant. Some were curious why Scavino tweeted it, however, or why Trump retweeted it. After your followers google 'nero' and 'fiddle,' they're going to demand you fire Dan Scavino for sabotaging you this way. â€” Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 8, 2020 Scavino is a federal employee â€” not a member of Trump's campaign, despite his normal posts â€” so maybe he's trying to warn Americans about the mood in the White House. Whatever it means, it sounds good to Trump. Which is another way of saying: Wash your hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap, and try not to touch your face. Peter Weber</description>

      <title>Not enough ICU beds or ventilators to deal with even moderate outbreak...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/900850/doesnt-have-enough-icu-beds-ventilators-deal-even-moderate-coronavirus-outbreak</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the World Health Organization and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have refrained from calling the new coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, CNN started referring to it as such on Monday. And although that should not 'cause panic,' it does mean the U.S. needs to shore up its medical resources before things get worse, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta explained in a Monday article. So far around the world we've seen 100,000 cases and 3,000 deaths from COVID-19, and in Gupta's opinion, that fits the CDC's definition of pandemic as 'an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.' And while the government isn't using that word yet, it is admitting that coronavirus spread is a question of not if, but when. Looking at how COVID-19 affected China can provide a preview of what it'll look like in the U.S. In China, 'around 80 percent of those infected with the coronavirus had symptoms of a bad cold and are expected to recover. Another 14 percent became severely ill, and 5 percent became critically ill,' Gupta writes. So according to estimates from the Department of Health and Human Services, that translates to about 200,000 people needing intensive care in the case of a moderate outbreak. That could be a big problem, seeing as the U.S. has less than 100,000 ICU beds. An estimated 64,000 people will also need ventilators in a moderate outbreak, CNN reports, but the U.S. only has about 62,000 of those machines ready to go. It has another 8,900 in its national stockpile, but 'given that this is flu season, many of those are already in use,' Gupta writes. Read more about the preparedness problem at CNN.

      <title>Close call threatens to upend Trump's routine...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Close-call-at-CPAC-threatens-to-upend-Trump-s-15115615.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - A growing sense of concern and uncertainty about the reach of the novel coronavirus has begun to take hold in the White House, after an attendee at a recent political conference where President Donald Trump spoke tested positive for covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.  Trump was photographed shaking hands with Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union who confirmed that he had been in direct contact with the infected man during the Conservative Political Action Conference last month.  The handshake at CPAC put Trump just two degrees of separation away from the virus that he has sought to minimize as it has rocked financial markets and tested his leadership skills. While the White House has maintained that Trump was never in direct contact with the infected person and is not suffering from any symptoms, the potential close call at a political event underscores how the outbreak threatens to upend the president's routine as he campaigns for reelection.  There is growing tension among Trump administration officials, who now see the rapidly spreading outbreak as an event that could consume the president's fourth year in office, even as Trump remains reluctant to see much cause for concern, according to White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal mood.  "I'm not concerned at all," Trump said Saturday when asked about the potential threat posed to the White House by the coronavirus.  He also pledged to keep holding "tremendous" political rallies, even as top public health officials within his government have called for millions of Americans to avoid large crowds and major events to reduce the risk of being infected.  White House officials have said they expect the outbreak to spread significantly throughout the country in the coming days,...</description>
