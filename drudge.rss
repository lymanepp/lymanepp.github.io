      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARADISE, Calif. (AP) — A fast-moving wildfire that ravaged a Northern California town Thursday sent residents racing to escape on roads that turned into tunnels of fire as thick smoke darkened the daytime sky. Several thousand buildings were destroyed by flames, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection official said. "We were surrounded by fire, we were driving through fire on each side of the road," said police officer Mark Bass, who lives in the hard-hit town of Paradise, where harrowing tales of escape and heroic rescues emerged after the entire community of 27,000 was ordered to evacuate.</description>

"Our rent in L.A. was $1,500 for a tiny, 650-square-foot apartment with no amenities," says Brown, 29, a native New Yorker, actress and New York University graduate. She and Shuman, a 28-year-old musician, began looking at Austin, Detroit, Portland, Oregon, and Columbus, Ohio, before settling on Atlanta. "There's a great arts community here [in Atlanta], and it's a growing city with lots of entrepreneurs," said Brown, who is now working several jobs and plans to open a business.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;OROVILLE, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on California wildfires (all times local): 6:45 p.m. Many people who fled a Northern California town to escape a wildfire say they don't know whether their homes survived. The police chief in the town of Paradise, Eric Reinbold, was in that group. Reinbold said Thursday he lives in the middle of town and doesn't know if his house is standing. The town of about 27,000 people 180 miles (290 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco was evacuated. An Associated Press photographer found businesses and homes leveled or in flames, including a liquor store and gas station. A California fire official says he has reports of several hundred structures that have been destroyed, but officials say they won't have an exact count until they can get into the area.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fox News host Tucker Carlson was at his desk Wednesday evening, less than two hours before his 8 p.m. live show, when he suddenly started receiving multiple text messages. There was some sort of commotion happening outside his home in Northwest D.C. "I called my wife," Carlson told The Washington Post in a phone interview. "She had been in the kitchen alone getting ready to go to dinner and she heard pounding on the front door and screaming. ... Someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door." His wife, thinking it was a home invasion, locked herself in the pantry and called 911, Carlson said. The couple have four children, but none were home at the time. But it wasn't a home invasion.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfchronicle.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 20,000 people were ordered to evacuate several Sierra foothills towns near Chico on Thursday as a wildfire raged out of control and grew to more than 18,000 acres in just seven hours. Law enforcement has reported that some residents and sheriff’s deputies are trapped inside the perimeter of the conflagration. With thousands trying to leave at the same time, evacuations have become “difficult, to say the least,” said Lt. Al Smith, of the Butte County Sheriff’s Office. Several sheriff’s deputies who went into the evacuation zones to rescue residents have also become trapped by active flames burning around them. “I can’t think of an area that’s safe right now,” Smith said.</description>
