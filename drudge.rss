      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union and Britain have agreed on a draft declaration on the future of their political relations after Brexit, European Council President Donald Tusk said Thursday, paving the way for an EU summit this weekend to rubber-stamp the deal. The draft declaration was agreed upon at a technical level by negotiators and endorsed Thursday by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm which is overseeing Brexit negotiations. "The (EU) Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators' level and agreed in principle at political level," Tusk said in a tweet.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHICO, Calif. - Thanksgiving marks two weeks since the deadliest fire in the state swept through this part of northern California, displacing thousands of families and turning Butte County into a disaster zone of smoke, emergency crews and an all-hands-on-deck effort to help those affected by the blaze. For some of those evacuees, the holiday known for gathering with family in a warm home will be spent in a shelter with strangers or in a tent in the rain. "It doesn't really feel like [a] holiday that much," said Kevin Alcott, whose home was destroyed when the fire flattened the town of Paradise, California.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Authorities are using a powerful tool in their effort to identify the scores of people killed by the wildfire that ripped through Northern California: rapid DNA testing that produces results in just two hours. The system can analyze DNA from bone fragments or other remains, then match it to genetic material provided by relatives of the missing. But the technology depends on people coming forward to give a DNA sample via a cheek swab, and so far, there are not nearly as many volunteers as authorities had hoped for.</description>

This could, under certain circumstances, mean directing troops to temporarily detain migrants in the event of disorder or violence against border patrol agents. "This is minutes -- not even hours" of potential detention, Mattis said, suggesting that he was not planning to use the military to operate migrant detention camps.</description>
