The statue in Elmwood was found covered in red paint on Monday, which is Columbus Day. A sign stating "Stop Celebrating Genocide" was chained around the pedestal and the word "Genocide" was painted on the base. Providence police took photographs of the damage and collected evidence. The statue, dedicated in 1893, was the target of vandals in 2010 and 2017. Columbus is a polarizing figure.</description>

      <title>President sets record -- 59 tweets in day!</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/871559/trump-now-averaging-36-tweets-day</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Impeachment has President Trump more hooked on Twitter than ever before. In the week before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) officially launched an impeachment inquiry into the president, he was still pretty addicted to social media, tweeting an average of 18 times per day. But the start of the inquiry has led Trump to double his tweet time, sending an average of 36 tweets a day, The Washington Post reports. Trump set the single-day tweeting record of his presidency just five days after the impeachment inquiry began, suggesting across 48 tweets and retweets on Sept. 29 that his impeachment would cause a "civil war" and attacking Fox &amp; Friends host Ed Henry 18 times. He then set another record last Friday, hitting "59 total tweets, including 33 in just 20 minutes," The Post writes. That included the announcement that Kevin McAleenan was leaving his spot as acting homeland security secretary. Trump's tweet storm has coincided with another devastating new fact: He's now averaging more false claims per day than ever before. Throughout his presidency, Trump has averaged 14 false claims per day, with a graph from the Post showing the daily total has consistently increased as he approaches his 1,000th day in office. In fact, over the past 65 days, Trump has relayed an average of 22 false claims per day, per the Post. That's largely thanks to Trump's phone call with Ukraine's presidency and all the ways he's tried to cover it up in the weeks since. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
