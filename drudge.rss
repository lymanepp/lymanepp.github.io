      <title>NFL TONIGHT: Players reportedly planning demonstration before season opener...</title>
      <link>https://www.thescore.com/nfl/news/2018047/report-chiefs-texans-players-planning-demonstration-before-season-opener</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thescore.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans players are discussing a joint demonstration to make a statement on racial injustice and display unity before Thursday night's NFL season opener, sources told NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.One possible idea involves both teams staying in their locker rooms during the national anthem.The situation is still fluid and final plans remain unfinalized, Pelissero adds. Leaders from both clubs involved include Patrick Mahomes, Deshaun Watson, and Kenny Stills.The NFL plans to implement more content addressing social and racial injustice to its Week 1 slate this season and is encouraging players to use their voices.Several teams canceled training camp practices last month in protest of the shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Wisconsin on Aug. 23. Players have been vocal in demonstrations since the incident, and a few prominent Black players discussed sitting out a game to force action.Some NFL players have chosen to stay off the field until after the national anthem in recent years. The league has never disciplined athletes for demonstrating during the anthem, an agreement that remains in place with the NFLPA.</description>

      <title>Stock market detached from economic reality. Reckoning coming?</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/opinion/article/The-stock-market-is-detached-from-economic-15556189.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the stock market surged last week, President Donald Trump was quick to tweet, "The Dow Jones Industrial just closed above 29,000!" The picture changed a bit after the Dow slid 800 points a few days later, largely driven by the poor performance of tech stocks, which continued after Labor Day weekend. But the stock market is a continuing obsession of his. "We have the greatest economy in the world," he said last month, boasting of market gains in the midst of a deep recession caused by the coronavirus.  But it's understandable why the president wants to use the markets as a measure of the economy's health, even as unemployment hovers at 8.4 percent and many businesses remain crippled. Since the start of the year, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index - even following the recent drop - is up 4.3 percent, and the Dow is down a mere 3 percent. If stocks were the sole measure of economic health, you might think the economy is on the mend, perhaps even poised for a breakout.  The president and his supporters are ignoring what former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently forcefully explained: "The stock market isn't the economy. The economy is production and jobs, and there are shortfalls in virtually every sector . . .." Yet how has the stock market remained so resilient in the face of such a severe economic shock? In part, it's because of inequality. Stocks are overwhelmingly owned by the top 1 percent, which means speculation can continue even as more people lost their jobs at the onset of this recession than at any time since the Great Depression.  What's more, measures such as the Dow and S&amp;P 500 reflect only the very largest U.S. companies, which can weather steep slumps in demand in a way that Main Street enterprises can't - while the relief packages Congress passed this spring were better at shielding...</description>

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-tries-to-limit-damage-from-revelations-he-15555290.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump acknowledged Wednesday that he intentionally played down the deadly nature of the rapidly spreading coronavirus last winter as an attempt to avoid a "frenzy," part of an escalating damage-control effort by his top advisers to contain the fallout from a forthcoming book by The Washington Post's Bob Woodward.  Trump's comments came hours after excerpts from the book and audiotapes of some of the 18 separate interviews he conducted with the renowned author were released, fueling a sense of outrage over the president's blunt description of knowing that he was not telling the truth about a virus that has killed nearly 190,000 Americans.  Democrats, led by their presidential nominee Joe Biden, denounced Trump's actions as part of a deliberate effort to lie to the public for his own political purposes when other world leaders took decisive action to warn their people and set those nations on a better path to handling the pandemic.  "He knew and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the American people. He knowingly and willingly lied about the threat it posed to the country for months," Biden said in front of the United Auto Workers training facility in Warren, Mich., where he delivered a speech on a "Made in America" plan for the economy.  Biden called Trump's actions "a life and death betrayal of the American people."  Trump said publicly that he did nothing wrong.  "So the fact is, I'm a cheerleader for this country. I love our country. And I don't want people to be frightened," Trump told reporters at the White House after announcing his potential Supreme Court nominees if he wins reelection. "I don't want to create panic, as you say. And certainly, I'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. We want to show...</description>

      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Trump-says-he-knew-coronavirus-was-deadly-and-15553997.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's head popped up during his top-secret intelligence briefing in the Oval Office on Jan. 28 when the discussion turned to the novel coronavirus outbreak in China.  "This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency," national security adviser Robert O'Brien told Trump, according to a new book by Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward. "This is going to be the roughest thing you face."  Matthew Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser, agreed. He told the president that after reaching contacts in China, it was evident that the world faced a health emergency on par with the flu pandemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide.  Ten days later, Trump called Woodward and revealed that he thought the situation was far more dire than what he had been saying publicly.  "You just breathe the air and that's how it's passed," Trump said in a Feb. 7 call. "And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flu."  "This is deadly stuff," the president repeated for emphasis.  At that time, Trump was telling the nation that the virus was no worse than a seasonal flu, predicting it would soon disappear, and insisting that the U.S. government had it totally under control. It would be several weeks before he would publicly acknowledge that the virus was no ordinary flu and that it could be transmitted through the air.  Trump admitted to Woodward on March 19 that he deliberately minimized the danger. "I wanted to always play it down," the president said.  Aside from exploring Trump's handling of the pandemic, Woodward's new book, "Rage," covers race relations, diplomacy with North Korea and a range of other issues that have arisen during...</description>

      <title>BERNSTEIN: 'GRAVER THAN WATERGATE'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/936691/carl-bernstein-says-bob-woodwards-revelations-about-trump-are-graver-than-watergate</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carl Bernstein has some strong words for what his former colleague's revelations mean for the Trump presidency and democracy itself. The Washington Post published a preview of Bob Woodward's forthcoming book Rage on Wednesday, in which Trump told Woodward in March that he knew COVID-19 was serious but 'wanted to always play it down.' Six months later, 190,000 people have died in the U.S. from the virus, and Woodward has just revealed Trump's 'homicidal negligence' is to blame, Bernstein told CNN. Bernstein and Woodward famously reported out the Watergate scandal that led to former President Richard Nixon's resignation. But 'the facts here are even graver than in Watergate,' Bernstein continued, because this 'dereliction of duty' has been recorded like never before. 'Thousands and thousands and thousands of people died' because Trump is 'putting his own re-election before the safety, health, and well-being of the people of the United States. We've never had a president who's done anything like this before,' Bernstein said. It's all going to go down as 'one of the great presidential felonies of all time, maybe the greatest presidential felony, and we have the smoking gun tape of the president committing the felony' Bernstein continued. Watch all of Bernstein's scathing appearance below. Kathryn Krawczyk  Legendary journalist Carl Bernstein reacts to Bob Woodward's conversation with Donald Trump.

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/936551/more-than-half-households-4-largest-cities-struggled-financially-during-pandemic-poll-shows</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's no question the coronavirus pandemic has forced many Americans into financial hardship, but a new NPR/Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health/Robert Wood Johnson Foundation survey provided a clearer picture of the extent of the struggles in the United States' four largest cities. At least half of all households in those cities â€” 53 percent in New York City, 56 percent in Los Angeles, 50 percent in Chicago, and 63 percent in Houston â€” reported facing serious financial problems, including depleted savings, problems paying credit card bills, and affording medical bills. Black and Latino households in all four cities were particularly vulnerable. In New York, 62 percent of Black households and 73 percent of Latino households reported struggles. In Los Angeles those numbers are 52 and 71 percent, respectively, while 69 percent of Black households and 63 percent of Latino households in Chicago have faced the same. And, most drastically, in Houston, 81 percent of Black households and 77 percent of Latino households said their financial issues were serious. Interviews for the poll were conducted online and via telephone between July 1-Aug. 3 among 3,454 adults in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. The overall margin of error was 3.3 percentage points, while it was 5.4 percent for New York, 7.1 percent for Los Angeles, 5.4 percent for Chicago, and 6.3 percent for Houston.
