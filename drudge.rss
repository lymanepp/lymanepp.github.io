      <title>TUCKER: Does Trump actually want to lose?</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/833479/fox-news-tucker-carlson-wonders-aloud-whether-trump-actually-wants-lose-2020</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it possible that President Trump actually has no intention of winning re-election in 2020? That's the question that was posed on Thursday by a surprising voice: Fox News' Tucker Carlson, who in a segment on his show wondered what it might look like if Trump had decided he didn't want to be president anymore and was taking steps to ensure he didn't win another term, per The Washington Post. In this "hypothetical" scenario, Carlson ran through a number of things Trump could do so that his base would turn on him â€” all of which line up with actual Trump administration actions or reported proposals. He noted, for example, that if Trump wanted to lose, he could raise gas taxes, something the administration is reportedly considering and an idea that Carlson said is "so mindless and counterproductive there's literally no way you could get re-elected after doing it." Later, he told Trump he should definitely "go with the gas tax" if he secretly wants "to retire early" and is "really sick of the job." Proposing cuts to Medicare and E-Verify would also be ways Trump could undermine his re-election chances, Carlson argued, as well as continuing "our pointless military intervention in Syria." These, again, are not hypothetical scenarios at all. â€œIf the president did all that, the message would be very clear: he has no idea what he ran on in 2016," Carlson said. "He just wants out.â€� This was a surprisingly brutal segment from the Fox News host, although he has been critical of Trump before. Carlson in December went off on the president by saying he hasn't kept his promises to voters and suggested that due to his lack of legislative experience, he is not "capable" of doing so.

      <title>Small towns find footing out West...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Small-towns-nd-footing-out-West-13743947.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HAMILTON, Mont. - As small towns elsewhere saw prosperity pass them by in favor of the big cities, something unusual happened to this rural hamlet tucked in the Bitterroot Valley: It flourished.  Two local boys came home from college and launched a microbrewery that takes in more than $1 million in annual sales. Retirees arrived in droves, drawn by affordable land and recreation opportunities in the area's snow-frosted mountains and trout-filled streams. And the federal government's Rocky Mountain Laboratories opened a state-of-the-art biosafety facility to investigate the deadliest viral diseases, including Ebola.  As U.S. economic growth in the past decade assumed an increasingly urban character, that diverse set of strengths enabled this town to defy a pervasive narrative of rural decline. Hamilton's population of 4,728 is up more than 10 percent since 2010, reflecting a Western renaissance that contrasts with the experience of small towns in other regions.  "It's a pretty sweet spot to be in," said economist Ray Rasker, of Headwaters Economics in Bozeman, Montana. "You can have the same job you'd have in Seattle and go fly fishing in the afternoon. . . . It's the quality of life. It attracts talent. Pretty soon, talent builds on itself, and word gets out."  Hamilton has parlayed distinctive attributes into population growth, including proximity to the state's second-largest city, majestic surroundings, a good supply of college graduates and a dependable base of federal government employment.  All of that makes Hamilton representative of a little-noticed trend. Western towns with fewer than 5,000 residents grew by an average of nearly 8 percent from 2010 to 2017, according to the Census Bureau, while similar-sized communities in the Northeast and Midwest shrank. Those in the South grew barely 1 percent.  "It is...</description>
