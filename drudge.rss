      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a move that is alarming San Francisco's biggest industry, a major medical association is pulling its annual convention out of the city - saying its members no longer feel safe.         "It's the first time that we have had an out-and-out cancellation over the issue, and this is a group that has been coming here every three or four years since the 1980s," said Joe D'Alessandro, president and CEO of S.F. Travel, the city's convention bureau.         D'Alessandro declined to name the medical association, saying the bureau still hopes to bring the group back in the future.
