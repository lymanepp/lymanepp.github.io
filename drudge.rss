      <title>Trump returns to Pennsylvania, rallying for repeat win...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-returns-to-Pennsylvania-rallying-for-14897350.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HERSHEY, Pa. - President Donald Trump returned to Pennsylvania for the fourth time this year on Tuesday, rallying loyal supporters here as part of his campaign's concerted effort to retain control of a state that helped lift him into the White House in 2016 and is likely critical to his reelection chances.  Trump's visit came on the same day that House Democrats officially introduced articles of impeachment against him, and the president struck a fiery note, railing against both the Democrats and the media from the earliest moments of his rally.  Calling the articles of impeachment "flimsy, pathetic, ridiculous," Trump dismissed the inquiry against him as the "impeachment crap," and said that any Democrat who votes for it would be sacrificing not just their House majority but their dignity.  "Everybody said, 'This is impeachment lite. This is the lightest impeachment in the history of the country, by far,' " Trump said. "It's not even an impeachment."  He added, later: "They're impeaching me because they want to win an election and that's the only way they can do it."  Trump rallied at the Giant Center, a 12,500-seat arena best known for hosting concerts and minor league hockey. He visited here in the closing days of the 2016 bid and during his "thank you" tour in December 2016 after he won the election.  Hershey is home to the Hershey Co., which produces chocolate candy and other sweets in the city.  The region, which is dotted with former mill towns and conservative congressional districts, was central to Trump's 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, with surging turnout in this area and others lifting Trump's statewide total even as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won in Philadelphia and its suburbs.  In the closing days of that race, a wave of navy blue Trump campaign signs...</description>

      <title>AFL-CIO's endorsement...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/We-ate-their-lunch-Democrats-claim-legislative-14897301.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's top trade official clashed with an influential Republican senator during a conference call Tuesday morning as some GOP discontent and resignation about the revised trade deal with Canada and Mexico began to grow. Congressional Democrats and the White House were separately touting a significant victory.  The frustrations of Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., about provisions of the new North American trade agreement were part of a contentious exchange that came as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer briefed key Senate Republicans on details of the deal, according to three officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the private conversation.  Toomey's aides declined to comment on the private call. But the senator - who had opposed the initial draft of the agreement struck by the Trump administration with Mexico and Canada last year - said the administration had given far too many concessions at the expense of Republican priorities.  "In fairness to Bob Lighthizer, there was a lot of discussion early on. But in the last few weeks, the discussion certainly didn't include me," Toomey said Tuesday. The negotiations "seemed to be a, you know, just a one-way direction in the direction of the Democrats."  The disagreement came amid signs of growing GOP discontent with multiple accommodations President Trump has made to win support from Democrats to secure legislative victories.  The revised trade agreement with Canada and Mexico won the enthusiastic support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday, with the union's backing signaling to many Republicans that the trade deal was perhaps not in their favor. On Monday, lawmakers unveiled a White House-backed defense bill that includes 12 weeks of paid parental leave for...</description>

      <title>Day of history accentuates America's divide...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/A-day-of-history-accentuates-America-s-divide-and-14897153.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - For only the fourth time in the nation's history congressional leaders on Tuesday put forward articles of impeachment against a president, but that milestone was the most predictable of events on a day that accentuated the degree to which the institutions of government are under stress and the citizens they serve are in conflict.  Amid the partisan breakdown over President Donald Trump's conduct in office, there was a rare statement of progress: a deal to cement a new U.S. trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, the only substantial legislative breakthrough of the year and one long sought by the president.  But in today's hyper-polarized environment, agreement among elected leaders - once considered the norm - is now the anomaly. Instead, the House Democrats' march to impeach Trump and the president's continuing war with the FBI over the origins of the Russia investigation more clearly characterized the strained state of the nation and the rising prominence of distorting facts for political gain.  "This moment tells us something about ourselves," said Ted Strickland, a former Democratic governor of Ohio. "Obviously what's happening is polarizing and will probably deepen the anger and the hostility that has characterized our politics for the last few years."  The impeachment proceedings have revealed a Republican Party whose elected officials are loath to acknowledge any wrongdoing by a president who insists he acted perfectly despite evidence to the contrary, let alone the question of whether what he did warrants his removal from office.  Meanwhile, Trump took the Justice Department's inspector general's report on the Russia investigation, which knocked down his long-stated assertion that the probe was political motivated, and used elements of it to continue his attack on the FBI - furthering the divide that...</description>

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Michael-Bloomberg-is-widely-unpopular-following-14895801.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Electability is a central pillar of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's newly launched presidential campaign, but a poll released Tuesday finds he is deeply unpopular with voters nationwide.  A Monmouth University poll found about twice as many registered voters rated Bloomberg negatively as positively -- 54% unfavorable, 26% favorable. That margin was significantly worse than for five other Democratic candidates, as well as for President Trump. That same measure hampered Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016.  Bloomberg garnered 5% support nationally for the Democratic nomination, narrowly higher than some other recent polls.He was in fifth place behind former vice president Joe Biden (26%) and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (21%) and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (17%). Bloomberg's support is within the margin of error of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 8%, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 4%, businessman Andrew Yang at 3% and Sen. Corey Booker of New Jersey at 2%.  Yet the negative favorability ratings are a sign Bloomberg may struggle to grow his support among both among Democrats the broader electorate. Since its launch last month, his campaign has spent more money on ads than all the top-polling Democrats combined and is simultaneously building out ground operations in 27 states.  "Bloomberg said he got into this race because he wants to defeat Trump, but his campaign kicks off with even lower ratings than the incumbent," said Monmouth polling director Patrick Murray. "That is not the most auspicious start, but views of Bloomberg are not as deeply held as they are for Trump, so he has room to shift those opinions,"  The Monmouth poll found leading Democratic candidates also have net negative images but by smaller margins than Bloomberg. Biden was rated favorably by 43% of all registered...</description>
