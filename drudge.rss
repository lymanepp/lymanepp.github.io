      <title>Biden and Trump battle for women who sided with president last time -- and now regret it... </title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Biden-and-Trump-battle-for-women-who-sided-with-15562688.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;From her home in the Philadelphia suburbs, Nin Bell works for an answering service, taking calls from people trying to reach more than 10,000 funeral homes and end-of-life companies. As the coronavirus began to sweep the country earlier this year, the number of calls related to new deaths tripled.  Caller after caller told her about losing a loved one to covid-19, as well as to suicides and drug overdoses. They provided an overwhelmingly painful window into just how badly the country was suffering.  And then Bell would hear President Donald Trump - whom she voted for in 2016, helping him win Pennsylvania - downplay the severity of the pandemic.  "He was telling everybody it wasn't a big deal - but I knew it was a big deal because of my job. I'm like: 'Why am I taking 60 coronavirus deaths in one day, on one shift, when I used to only take 20 death calls a day?'" said Bell, 47, the mother of two teenage boys who lives in Parkside, about 20 miles southwest of Philadelphia."He made a lot of mistakes. He just runs his mouth. . . . He's the president, he can't get away with that, especially when people's lives are in danger."  Bell "definitely, 100 percent" plans to vote for Joe Biden for president - and she has been urging others to do the same.  She's part of a group of White women, especially those who are middle- or working-class, who didn't vote for Hillary Clinton in the last election but are determined to vote for Biden this year.  Those women, who have been targeted by both campaigns, loom large in a presidential race that could, like 2016's, be decided by shifts among a few sets of voters in the highly polarized nation.  Although Clinton won the majority of votes from women in 2016, she lost to Trump among White women. Since then, however, polls have shown Trump...</description>

      <title>California's smoke plumes unlike anything previously seen...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/California-s-wildfire-smoke-plumes-are-unlike-15562222.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 3.1 million acres have burned in California this year, part of a record fire season that still has four months to go. A suffocating cloud of smoke has veiled the West Coast for days, extending more than a thousand miles above the Pacific. And the extreme fire behavior that's been witnessed this year hasn't just been wild - it's virtually unprecedented in scope and scale.  Fire tornadoes have spun up by the handful in at least three big wildfires in the past three weeks, based on radar data. Giant clouds of ash and smoke have generated lightning. Multiple fires have gone from a few acres to more than 100,000 acres in size in a day, while advancing as many as 25 miles in a single night. And wildfire plumes have soared up to 10 miles high, above the cruise altitude of commercial jets.  Scientists have been scrambling to collect as much data on these wildfires as possible, hoping to unlock the secrets to their extreme behavior and fury. Among them is Neil Lareau, a professor of atmospheric sciences in the department of physics at the University of Nevada at Reno. Lareau closely studies pyrocumulus clouds, towering explosion-like plumes of heat that develop above intense blazes.  He retrieved data from the National Weather Service's network of Doppler radars, which scan the skies every few moments at up to 15 different vertical angles. By stitching these different elevation "slices" together, he was able to produce a three-dimensional model of each smoke plume.  The Creek Fire, which burned nearly 200,000 acres in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, was only 6% contained on Friday. On Sept. 5, a day after it was first ignited, its smoke plume soared to 55,000 feet. That's taller than many of the tornadic thunderstorms that roll across Oklahoma and Kansas each spring.  Such clouds are both indicators of and contributors to...</description>

Both sets of plans nod to the campaign's challenges this cycle ‚Äî the fundraisers come amid home stretch money concerns, while the public events were still in flux late in the week due to pandemic-related challenges that have dogged similar rally plans this year.</description>

      <title>Greek and Turkish ships playing chicken at sea. There's already been one crash....</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Greek-and-Turkish-ships-are-playing-chicken-at-15562178.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last weekend, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan demanded that Greece engage in talks over escalating tensions in the eastern Mediterranean, warning that "They're either going to understand the language of politics and diplomacy, or in the field with painful experiences." The Greek government, meanwhile, announced further steps this week to bolster the country's defenses.  New tensions between the two longtime rivals flared up in mid-August, when Turkey deployed the research vessel Oru√ß Reis, flanked by two warships, to explore for oil and gas in contested waters between the islands of Crete and Cyprus. Greece accused Turkey of violating its sovereign rights -- and dispatched warships of its own, precipitating a collision between a Greek frigate and a Turkish warship.  How Greece and Turkey interpret international maritime law is key to understanding what's going on in this contested part of the Mediterranean, a conflict that risks drawing in other countries, including Germany, France and the UAE. Here's what our research tells us.  - Parties are doubling down on dueling interpretations of the law of the sea. The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) asserts that countries may claim a territorial sea extending up to 12 nautical miles (nm) from their coasts, including sovereignty over the offshore oil under those waters. UNCLOS also grants nations the right to claim "sovereign rights and jurisdiction" over the waters, seabed and subsoil of an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extending up to 200 nm, as well as a continental shelf extending up to 350 nm in certain circumstances.  This might sound straightforward, but in semi-enclosed seas like the Aegean and Mediterranean, geographical limitations and overlapping claims make it near-impossible for any country to stake out its full jurisdiction. For this...</description>

      <title>Advantages of incumbency crumbling away for Trump...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/The-advantages-of-incumbency-are-crumbling-away-15562130.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump had a bad week: That was the week before last. He had another one this past week. For someone trailing former vice president Joe Biden in the presidential race, Trump remains the biggest obstacle to reelection, an embattled incumbent who is frittering away the advantages of incumbency.  The week before last it was an article in the Atlantic by Jeffrey Goldberg that portrayed the president using derogatory language about military personnel killed or wounded in action. It was based on several unnamed sources and Trump - and others now or formerly in the administration - vigorously disputed the account. Prominently absent from those publicly defending Trump were former defense secretary Jim Mattis and, critically, former White House chief of staff John Kelly.  This past week it was an entirely different issue for the president - a self-inflicted problem that was the result of his many hours of taped, on-the-record conversations with Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward, whose book "Rage" will be published this week.  Trump's own words plunged him into a controversy about how early knew about the dangers of the coronavirus and why he didn't share that with the public. Because he couldn't disclaim what was on the tapes, he offered as a defense that he didn't want to panic the public - though as The Post's Phil Rucker pointed out, the president has repeatedly played on fear as a political weapon.  Throughout his presidency, Trump has been skillful at creating diversions when things go awry. Today it's more the case that events are creating distractions from his ability to deliver a consistent and effective campaign message. This is one more example of the reality that, since the beginning of the year, he has seen the advantages of incumbency erode or disappear.  Before the pandemic, the economy...</description>

      <title>But Sanders shows concerns over campaign...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Sanders-shows-concerns-over-Biden-campaign-15562057.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is privately expressing concerns about Joe Biden's presidential campaign, according to three people with knowledge of the conversations, urging Biden's team to intensify its focus on pocketbook issues and appeals to liberal voters.  Sanders, the runner-up to Biden in the Democratic primary, has told associates that Biden is at serious risk of coming up short in the November election if he continues his vaguer, more centrist approach, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive talks.  The senator has identified several specific changes he'd like to see, saying Biden should talk more about health care and about his economic plans, and should campaign more with figures popular among young liberals, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.  Asked for comment, Sanders's team provided a statement from Faiz Shakir, the senator's former campaign manager in the presidential race, saying that Sanders is "working as hard as he can" to get Biden elected but has advised some strategic adjustments.  "Senator Sanders is confident that Joe Biden is in a very strong position to win this election, but nevertheless feels there are areas the campaign can continue to improve upon," Shakir said. "He has been in direct contact with the Biden team and has urged them to put more emphasis on how they will raise wages, create millions of good paying jobs, lower the cost of prescription drugs and expand health care coverage."  Shakir said Sanders "also thinks that a stronger outreach to young people, the Latino community and the progressive movement will be of real help to the campaign."  The Biden campaign declined to comment.  Sanders led a surging liberal faction during the Democratic primaries and scored early successes...</description>

      <title>HAPPY VALLEY  HEARTBREAK</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Half-a-million-Oregonians-more-than-10-percent-15559123.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HAPPY VALLEY, Ore. - Wildfires across the West Coast have killed at least 19 people in California and have ravaged more than a million acres of land in Oregon, where dozens of people were missing and tens of thousands of residents evacuated their homes amid some of the most dangerous air conditions in the world.  Oregon officials said they believe the wildfires could have claimed numerous lives because of how many structures have burned, but they said a death toll is unclear as they began to survey the destruction. Fires continued to rip through more than 1,500 square miles in the state on Friday.  "We know we're dealing with fire-related death, and we're preparing for a mass fatality incident based on what we know and the number of structures that have been lost," said Andrew Phelps, director of Oregon's Office of Emergency Management. Phelps said he could not confirm how many deaths had occurred from the fires, but a state-run dashboard recorded at least five fatalities.  After days of high temperatures and dry winds, cooler weather on Friday allowed firefighters to begin to contain some of the 16 fires across the state. But they had barely begun to make headway when dense smoke limited firefighters' ability to fly, said Doug Grafe, chief of fire protection for the Oregon Department of Forestry. Eight of the 16 fires will be on the map until fall rains arrive, Grafe said.  A cluster of fires grew dramatically across a swath of 56 miles southeast of Portland, burning about 440,000 acres in an area of the state unaccustomed to wildfires of this magnitude, Grafe said. A blanket of smoke covered the sky even in downtown Portland, where officials opened up the Oregon Convention Center for evacuees.  "We have not seen the likes of this fire in this state, this integrated with our communities, ever before," Grafe said. "We...</description>
