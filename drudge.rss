      <title>Virginia prison guards strip-search 8-year-old girl visiting her father...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Virginia-prison-guards-strip-searched-an-14886904.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Diamond Peerman drove 2 1/2 hours the Sunday before Thanksgiving to take her boyfriend's 8-year-old daughter to visit him at a state prison in Dillwyn, Virginia.  When a drug-sniffing dog fixated on the pair, a Buckingham Correctional Center guard told them they had to submit to strip-searches or else they could be banned from the prison, Peerman told The Washington Post. The girl balked at the idea of removing her clothes in front of uniformed strangers.  "I told her, that means you have to take all of your clothes off or you're not going to be able to see your dad," Peerman told the Virginian-Pilot, which first reported the search Thursday. "That's when she started crying."  The incident rang alarm bells for the girl's mother, civil rights advocates and Virginia Department of Corrections officials, who said the decision to strip-search the girl without her legal guardian's permission defied its internal policies. The incident also resurfaced a history of controversial strip searches, which have scared, punished and humiliated children in other cases.  After the Nov. 24 search, the girl texted her mother and shared her anger over being forced to disrobe.  "Hey Mom," she wrote in a text published by the Virginian-Pilot. "Am so mad the jail had to strip me with all of my clothes off this doesn't make no [sense]."  Her mom responded with disbelief.  "Did they make you take your pants off?"  "Yes all of my clothes off."  The mother, who was not named to protect the identity of the girl, told the Virginian-Pilot her daughter has a good relationship with her father, but only because she can visit him every weekend. Now she says she will not send her child back to the state-run prison. The girl has missed school because of her distress over the search, which has exacerbated her...</description>

      <title>Phone records obtained in inquiry spark controversy...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Phone-records-from-AT-T-and-Verizon-obtained-in-14886889.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Phone logs subpoenaed from Verizon and AT&amp;T put a spotlight on the powerful tools at lawmakers' disposal as they seek to investigate President Donald Trump in the impeachment inquiry.  The records were some of the strongest circumstantial evidence included in the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment report this week, revealing extensive contact between Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and the Trump administration during critical points of the Ukraine saga. They also exposed calls between a Giuliani associate who has been indicted in New York, Lev Parnas, and the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes of California.  Republican lawmakers are blasting Democrats' decision to publish the records of Nunes' calls, as well as call records from John Solomon, a conservative columnist formerly at The Hill. Nunes said in a Fox News interview the inclusion of the phone records in the impeachment report is an infraction of his "civil rights" and promised to explore "whatever legal remedies I have."  "They have now set a precedent where Adam Schiff can go get any phone number he has to AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T is going to comply," Nunes said.  Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., called Schiff's move "brazen and shameful" in an op-ed for Fox News yesterday. Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., asked Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to subpoena Schiff's records in response, a move the South Carolina Republican shut down.  But Democrats deny legally asking the telecom companies for any phone records belonging to members of Congress or journalists. The report doesn't say whose records the committee subpoenaed, but the records suggest they targeted the calls of Giuliani and Parnas.  "The Republican Minority of the three committees has had access to these subpoenaed records and the subpoenas themselves, and...</description>

      <title>Logs renew concern about security of Trump communications... </title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Phone-logs-in-impeachment-report-renew-concern-14885944.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has routinely communicated with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and other individuals speaking on cellphones vulnerable to monitoring by Russian and other foreign intelligence services, current and former U.S. officials said.  Phone records released this week by the House Intelligence Committee revealed extensive communications among Giuliani, unidentified individuals at the White House and others involved in the campaign to pressure Ukraine, with no indication that those calls were encrypted or otherwise shielded from foreign surveillance.  The revelations raise the possibility that Moscow was able to learn about aspects of Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to investigate a political rival months before that effort was exposed by a whistleblower report and the impeachment inquiry, officials said.  Trump is not identified by name in the House phone records, but investigators said they suspect he may be a person with a blocked number listed as "-1" in the files. And administration officials said separately that Trump has communicated regularly with Giuliani on unsecured lines.  "It happened all the time," said one former White House official, who noted that Giuliani had a range of foreign clients.  The disclosures provide fresh evidence suggesting that the president continues to defy the security guidance urged by his own aides and followed by previous incumbents - a stance that is particularly remarkable given Trump's attacks on Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign for her use of a private email account while she served as secretary of state.  The connection to the Ukraine campaign is also troubling because of how Moscow could exploit knowledge that Trump was secretly engaged in efforts to extract political favors from the government in Kyiv.  Insight into Giuliani's...</description>
