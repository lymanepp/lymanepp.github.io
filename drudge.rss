      <title>The first 'first gentleman'?</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/lifestyle/article/Chasten-Buttigieg-has-been-a-homeless-13813031.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Are you going to write about my meal?" Chasten Buttigieg asks, scanning the breakfast menu of a Manhattan cafe last month.  He had oatmeal with a side of fresh fruit. And tea.  The 29-year-old former drama teacher has often courted attention, but he's never been more watched than in these last few months as his husband, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, emerged as a serious contender for president. It's why he can't smell deodorants at Target without risking getting caught in the act by teenage iPhone paparazzi, or eat chicken nuggets in his car without being startled by a stranger rapping on the window.  It's why, the previous night in New York with Pete (who was scheduled to be on "Morning Joe" the next day), he resisted the urge swipe an entire cheese wheel from the fruit plate in his hotel room, because. . . well, wouldn't that seem weird to whoever came to collect the tray? Fruit untouched, cheese wheel gone? "I was very in my head about it," Chasten says. So he took a banana instead.  Yes, the nation's would-be first first gentleman is worried about the politics of hoarding cheese and sniffing deodorant. That's not all he's worried about, of course, but he's not shy about sharing the weird side of campaign fame. Chasten's humor and openness have been his defining features since the national spotlight found him and "Mayor Pete" earlier this year. It has made him a force on Twitter, where he has more than 300,000 followers, and a not-so-secret weapon for his candidate husband, a former Naval intelligence officer and management consultant who has more fluency with foreign languages than pop-culture quips.  "When you think of Chasten you think of someone who is very quick with his wit," says Kristie Bach, his high-school drama teacher. "He's always got the right thing to say at the right time."  That's...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinese authorities in Xinjiang are building a comprehensive database that tracks the precise locations of its citizens, their mobile app usage, their religious habits and even their electricity and gasoline consumption as part of a technology-driven crackdown that has interred an estimated 1 million Muslim citizens, according to an analysis of Chinese government software by a U.S. rights group.  In the last two years, a growing body of testimony by former Xinjiang residents and a trove of government procurement documents, directives and state media reports have painted a picture of oppression in the region, where Chinese authorities have relied on far-reaching electronic surveillance to help dictate its mass internment program.  New York-based Human Rights Watch said Thursday it gained a new level of insight into precisely what information the Chinese government collects by examining a mobile app that Xinjiang officials use to input data into a database called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform.  The IJOP system, which keeps track of practically the entire Xinjiang population, alerts authorities when a person unexpectedly crosses virtual "fences" by driving past a certain checkpoint or checking into a hotel, according to the rights group. It tracks citizens' smartphones, their national identification cards and GPS devices on their vehicles, which have been widely installed under new government regulations.  After denying their existence for a year, Chinese authorities have recently argued that Xinjiang's network of detention centers are built for educating and de-radicalizing a Muslim population that became increasingly influenced by extremist Islamic ideology.  International rights groups and Western countries say the limited extremist threat does not warrant the vast scale of the internments, a suffocating...</description>

      <title>UFO info not for general public, Navy says...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/UFO-information-not-expected-to-go-to-general-13810876.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The U.S. Navy has drafted a procedure to investigate and catalogue reports of unidentified flying objects coming in from its pilots. But the service doesn't expect to make the information public, citing privileged and classified reporting that is typically included in such files.  Joe Gradisher, a spokesman for the office of the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare, said in a statement that the Navy expects to keep the information it gathers private for a number of reasons.  "Military aviation safety organizations always retain reporting of hazards to aviation as privileged information in order to preserve the free and honest prioritization and discussion of safety among aircrew," Gradisher said. "Furthermore, any report generated as a result of these investigations will, by necessity, include classified information on military operations."  He added, "Therefore, no release of information to the general public is expected."  The Navy's recent decision to draft formal guidelines for pilots to document encounters with unexplained aerial phenomena comes after the revelation in late 2017 that the Pentagon ran a secret "UFO" office that spent $22 million over five years to collect and analyze "anomalous aerospace threats." Funding for the office, known as the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, or AATIP, officially ended in 2012, though operations continued.  Among other things, the program resulted in the release of footage from the cockpit cameras of military aircraft, which appeared to document oval-shape vessels that resemble flying Tic Tacs.  Reports of curious sightings from military aircraft aren't new. During World War II, Allied military pilots witnessed unexplained objects and fireballs that they dubbed "foo fighters." A number of official government investigations looked into such...</description>

      <title>BUZZ ALDRIN: Time to plot  migration to Mars...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Buzz-Aldrin-It-s-time-to-focus-on-the-great-13811434.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last month, Vice President Mike Pence announced that we are headed back to the moon. I am with him, in spirit and aspiration. Having been there, I can say it is high time we returned. When Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and I went to the moon 50 years ago this July, we did so with a mission. Apollo 11 aimed to prove America's can-do commitment to space exploration, as well as its national security and technological superiority. We did all that. We also "Came in Peace for all Mankind." More of that is needed now.  Today, many nations have eyes for the moon, from China and Russia to friends in Europe and Middle East. That is all good. The United States should cooperate - and offer itself as a willing team leader - in exploring every aspect of the moon, from its geology and topography to its hydrology and cosmic history. In doing so, we can take "low-Earth orbit" cooperation to the moon, openly, eagerly and collegially.  Meanwhile, another looming orb - the red one - should become a serious focus of U.S. attention. Mars is waiting to be discovered, not by clever robots and rovers - though I support NASA's unmanned missions - but by living, breathing, walking, talking, caring and daring men and women.  To make that happen, members of Congress, the Trump administration and the American public must care enough to make human exploration missions to Mars a national priority. To be clear, I do not mean spending billions of taxpayer dollars on a few hijinks or joy rides, allowing those who return to write books, tweet photos and talk of the novelty. I mean something very different.  The United States' eyes - and our unified commitment - should focus on opening the door, in our time, to the great migration of humankind to Mars. Books aplenty have been written about how to do this, and they have inspired government and...</description>

      <title>White House seeking NSA surveillance power permanent renewal?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Permanent-renewal-of-NSA-law-possible-13809653.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Trump administration has signaled in recent weeks that it may seek the permanent renewal of a surveillance law that has, among other things, enabled the National Security Agency to gather and analyze Americans' phone records as part of terrorism investigations, according to five U.S. officials familiar with the matter.  The White House, these officials said, was prepared to issue a public statement calling on Congress to reauthorize in full Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which in the past has been the focus of heated debate over the acceptable bounds of government surveillance. The plan to issue a statement was put on hold, officials said, but it illustrates nonetheless where the administration stands on the contested issue of national security authority.  The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an issue that remains deeply sensitive.  A White House spokeswoman declined to comment or explain why the statement was not issued, saying only that the matter is still under deliberation.  Section 215 was last revised in 2015 as part of the USA Freedom Act after a former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, exposed how the government was collecting vast quantities of Americans' phone logs to be able to scan them for clues to terrorist plots. This "metadata" denoted the calls' time, date and duration, and who called whom, but did not include the conversations' content. The ensuing uproar led Congress to impose restraints, and last year, the NSA reportedly suspended the program because of technical issues that put Americans' privacy at risk.  The statute expires in mid-December, and the reported suspension of the phone records program had raised questions about whether the Trump administration would seek to renew it. National security officials widely expect the administration to call for Congress...</description>

      <title>CONTEMPT?</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/House-Democrats-consider-holding-Barr-in-contempt-13810687.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are discussing holding Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for ignoring a subpoena and threatening to skip a scheduled, according to several lawmakers and officials familiar with the plan.  During a pair of closed-door meetings Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, the committee decided that it would probably make a push for a Barr contempt citation if he refuses to testify Thursday or ignores their subpoena for the full, unredacted report by special counsel Robert Mueller III.  Lawmakers and officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss private deliberations, cautioned that no final decision has been made. Barr was supposed to hand over the full Mueller report by 10 a.m. Wednesday.  Additionally, Barr on Friday threatened to skipa Judiciary Committee hearing over objections to the format in which a counsel would question him alongside lawmakers. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, the committee has yet to receive an answer about whether he is coming, panel officials said.  "We are now seeing the attorney general engage in obstruction of a congressional subpoena," said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., a member of the committee. "Congress has a number of tools at its disposal, obviously beginning with holding him in contempt."  Discussions about contempt for Barr follow the disclosure that Mueller challenged the attorney general's handling of the report on Russia interference in the 2016 election. The news that Mueller felt Barr misconstrued his findings reverberated in the House, with Democrats accusing Barr of perjuring himself in testimony to Congress.  In back-to-back congressional hearings in early April, Barr claimed to have no knowledge of Mueller's concerns with his four-page summary of the report's findings. But Mueller's March 27...</description>
