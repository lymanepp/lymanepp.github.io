      <title>Senate slipping away...</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/d97c666cf6fa4a42a7cadc9b9ac742de</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — In the closing stretch of the 2018 campaign, the question is no longer the size of the Democratic wave. It's whether there will be a wave at all. Top operatives in both political parties concede that Democrats' narrow path to the Senate majority has essentially disappeared, a casualty of surging Republican enthusiasm across GOP strongholds. At the same time, leading Democrats now fear the battle for the House majority will be decided by just a handful of seats.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HUIXTLA, Mexico - Edith Cruz was sitting at home in central Honduras, scanning Facebook on her phone, when she saw the post about the caravan on a community news page. It was Oct. 12. She and her cousin had just opened a small business selling tortillas when they were confronted by a gang, threatened with death if they didn't hand over half of their profits. She looked at the Facebook post: "An avalanche of Hondurans is preparing to leave in a caravan to the United States. Share this!" Within three hours, her bags were packed. The question of how the migrant caravan began has wound its way to the American midterm elections. President Donald Trump and other Republicans have suggested that Democrats paid migrants to begin the journey.</description>

"What we need to do is make sure that we provide for the common defense of the people of the United States of America and that's the president's determination here," Pence said in an interview with The Washington Post, when asked if nuclear weapons should be banned from orbit. Pence added, "What we want to do is continue to advance the principle that peace comes through strength.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is battling Democrats for control of Congress. But you might think it's 2016 all over again. As the 2018 midterms shifted to the final two weeks of campaigning, Trump staged a large Monday night rally in Houston, Ted Cruz's hometown, to help the Texas senator and his 2016 presidential rival fend off a tough challenge from Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke. During the 2016 primaries, Trump mocked Cruz as "Lyin' Ted," insulted his wife's appearance and suggested Cruz's father played a role in the Kennedy assassination. Cruz assailed Trump as a "sniveling coward" and told Trump to leave his wife alone. But campaigns have a way of letting bygones be bygones.</description>
