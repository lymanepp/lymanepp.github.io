      <title>For AIRBNB employees, dream turns into disillusionment...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/For-Airbnb-Employees-Dream-Turns-Into-14457034.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN FRANCISCO - Last summer, several Airbnb employees wrote a letter to the online room-rental startup's founders.  On behalf of more than a dozen employees, they pleaded to be able to sell their Airbnb stock options. Because Airbnb is privately held, its shares cannot be easily traded or cashed in. So the employees also asked that the company go public, a move that would let them freely sell their shares, said five people who saw or were briefed on the document and were not authorized to speak publicly.  The letter was a sign of the tension that has built up among Airbnb's workers.  According to interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees and investors, most of whom declined to be identified for fear of retaliation, Airbnb's 6,000-person workforce has become increasingly frustrated by not being able to cash in the company stock that was received in compensation packages. Waiting for the startup to go public has become a growing source of stress, many said, preventing some from making career changes, starting a family or moving on with their lives.  Questions about going public have risen to the top of an internal message board where employees vote for topics for executives to address every few months, the people said. The discontent has been exacerbated because Airbnb, which has been valued at $31 billion, doled out two tranches of employee equity that are set to start expiring in November 2020 and in mid-2021; those shares will become worthless if the company is not trading publicly by then, they said.  To try to keep employees happy, Brian Chesky, Airbnb's chief executive, and other top executives have made some adjustments, the people said. They began offering sabbaticals to longtime employees, extended Airbnb's parental leave policy and increased the retirement matching program. They...</description>
