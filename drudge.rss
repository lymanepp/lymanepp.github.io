      <title>Virginia braces for enormous gun-rights rally Monday...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Virginia-braces-for-enormous-gun-rights-rally-14986210.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RICHMOND, Va. - The convoys and militias are coming, if social media posts are to be believed. Headed to Virginia's capital on Monday to take a stand for gun rights - or, in the words of some,to fan the flames of a civil war.  "I'll be rolling into town early. I can't give you my exact time for security reasons," said Christian Yingling, head of the Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia and a leader at theUnite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.  "I organized a convoy, places we can meet up and drive up together. I'll be leading it," said Tammy Lee, a militia activist in Oklahoma.  Both Lee and Yingling were members of groups that signed consent decrees never to return to Charlottesville while armed, part of a lawsuit settlement over the violence there. But there is no restriction against coming to Richmond.  Thousands will join them, they say, for a rally Monday on Capitol Square to protest plans by the new Democratic majority in the General Assembly to pass gun-control laws. State and federal officials were preparing for a volatile mix of weapons, passions and anti-government fervor. Central Richmond was braced for road closures and massive police presence.  That was before President Donald Trump decided to weigh in Friday afternoon on Twitter.  "Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia," Trump tweeted. "That's what happens when you vote for Democrats, they will take your guns away. Republicans will win Virginia in 2020. Thank you Dems!"  Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam last week declared a state of emergency and issued a ban on firearms or other weapons on Capitol grounds. The state Supreme Court upheld the ban after a challenge by two gun-rights groups. The Federal Aviation Administration has issued temporary...</description>
