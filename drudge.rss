      <title>DEMS SPEED IT UP</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Trump-deflects-and-defies-as-Democrats-speed-up-14468600.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump struck a stance of defiance Wednesday, proclaiming his innocence and leveling distortions and falsehoods after the publicly released notes of his phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart turbocharged the push on Capitol Hill for his impeachment.  The five pages of a rough transcript of Trump's call asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Attorney General William Barr and personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden landed like a hand grenade on Capitol Hill and led House Democrats to recalibrate their strategy.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her fellow Democratic leaders agreed to speed up their impeachment investigation and significantly narrow it to Trump's dealings with Ukraine, according to five Democrats familiar with their discussions during a closed-door emergency meeting Wednesday in Pelosi's office.  Democratic leaders see the evidence from the Zelensky call as damning enough to impeach - and easy enough for the public to digest - in isolation, without drawing in allegations of obstruction of justice, self-dealing and other wrongdoing. Leaders began discussing a swift timeline to, in the words of one member, "strike while the iron's hot" and possibly vote on articles of impeachment before the end of the year.  "It's very understandable," said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md. "It's a betrayal of the presidency of the United States, which is now making deals to affect an election, to go after an opponent with a foreign leader who is relying on the United States."  Trump presented himself as an aggrieved victim of "viciousness" from Democrats and the media during a meandering and uncharacteristically muted news conference late Wednesday in New York. He defended his conduct in the July 25 call...</description>

      <title>Year after Moonves ouster, CBS seeks new programming direction...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/entertainment/article/A-year-after-Les-Moonves-ouster-CBS-seeks-a-new-14469665.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK - The veteran producer looked at the priest in disbelief.  "Look, I agreed to give you 20 minutes so (a colleague) doesn't drop a Me Too bomb on me," said the producer.  "So you think you're vulnerable to Me Too?" said the priest.  The producer shook his head. "There's a reason Weinstein went down. I don't use sex. And I'm much more talented."  Then the director yelled cut.  The moment was part of a shoot on the much-anticipated new CBS show "Evil" - the priest was part of a trio investigating a slick entertainment boss for fostering a toxic work culture.  If that last part sounds familiar, it should. "Evil" debuts on a network that spent much of last year dogged by sexual-misconduct allegations against former chief executive Leslie Moonves along with accusations of sexual harassment on multiple sets.  That a CBS primetime series is willing to tackle an incisively modern issue - this incisively modern issue - offers a telling snapshot of just how new a moment the network is looking to create.  CBS launches its fall schedule this week - Thursday's "Evil" premiere is one of a half-dozen new series on the network with blockbuster dreams. But amid the traditional rollout of broadcast hopefuls is one of the trickier balances in modern TV. CBS must advance a diverse and socially conscious post-Moonves form of storytelling without abandoning the middle-of-the-road formula he rode to great success.  "Our goal is to figure out the next generation of shows and make some unexpected moves while still appealing to the core CBS audience," said David Nevins, CBS' chief creative officer and Moonves' programming successor. "We can broaden and we can be more surprising, but without alienating people."  CBS has been the most-watched broadcast network every year for the past 11 - meaning...</description>

      <title>'Outrage is a commodity': Director Todd Phillips bashes 'far left' criticism of 'JOKER'...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/entertainment/article/Outrage-is-a-commodity-Director-Todd-Phillips-14469623.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since debuting at the Venice International Film Festival earlier this month, "Joker," an R-rated supervillain origin story, has drawn both rave reviews and concerns over its realistic portrayal of a character sliding into a psychosis that leads him to kill.  The film's director, though, fiercely defended his film in a newly published interview, arguing that those worries are little more than the complaints of people looking for something to be angry about.  "I think it's because outrage is a commodity, I think it's something that has been a commodity for a while," director Todd Phillips told the Wrap in a Sept. 20 interview first published Wednesday. "What's outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda. It's really been eye-opening for me."  Though the film won the top prize in Venice and has been well reviewed before its Oct. 4 release in the United States, it has also stirred fears of gun violence and criticisms that the film glorifies the bloody action at the center of its plot. Some of that uproar has emerged after Phillips originally spoke to the Wrap.  This week, the families of those killed in a mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater in 2012 asked Warner Bros. to donate proceeds to groups supporting victims and urged Congress to pass bipartisan gun-control legislation. The theater in Aurora where the massacre took place during a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises" is refusing to show "Joker," a manager told The Washington Post.  On Sept. 18, a U.S. Army base in Oklahoma warned its service members that online threats had been made to target an unspecified theater during the "Joker" release, Christopher Grey, an Army Criminal Investigation Command spokesman, told The Post in a statement. A second memo sent Monday reiterated...</description>

      <title>Lawmakers say Boris rhetoric stirs hate as rancor over Brexit intensifies...</title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Lawmakers-say-Johnson-s-rhetoric-stirs-hate-as-14469414.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LONDON -A raw, noxious session of Parliament that left lawmakers expressing fears for their safety amid death threats has intensified Britain's national rancor over Brexit, while drawing from Prime Minister Boris Johnson a dismissive "humbug."  Johnson was rebuked by lawmakers on all sides for his language in a bombastic performance in the House of Commons on Wednesday night, when the prime minister used terms such as "betray" and "surrender" to describe opponents blocking his path for exiting the European Union.  Long-serving members, veteran journalists and British historians said they had never seen a more toxic session of Parliament than the one that unfolded after Johnson's return to the House of Commons, just a day after the Supreme Court ruled that the new prime minister's suspension of Parliament had been "unlawful."  After cutting short a trip to New York, where he attended the U.N. General Assembly and met with President Donald Trump, the prime minister delivered a statement to the House in which he apparently tried to goad opposition lawmakers into granting him an early election. Johnson called them "cowards." His opponents called him "unfit to serve" and shouted for his resignation.  But it wasn't just the jeering and sneering and clapping that prompted many observers to say it was one of the most extraordinary parliamentary sessions ever witnessed. It was Johnson's choice of words.  Several women lawmakers stood up in Parliament and pleaded with Johnson to moderate his language. Some pointed out the death threats they have received.  Opening Parliament on Thursday, Speaker John Bercow said that the atmosphere on Wednesday was "toxic" and "worse than any I have known in my 22 years in the House."  Bercow urged lawmakers to "treat each other as opponents, not as...</description>

      <title>Seven-day scramble ends with big gamble... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-seven-day-White-House-scramble-ends-with-a-big-14468634.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - After news broke that a phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was at the center of an explosive whistleblower complaint, Trump was largely undaunted.  But many of his senior advisers weren't nearly as confident, and an internal debate roiled the White House.  The notes from his call with the Ukrainian leader showed the conversation was not as "perfect" and "totally appropriate" as Trump had declared, and they warned him that sharing it might not be exculpatory. Two of his top Cabinet secretaries argued against disclosure, saying it would set a dangerous precedent to share details of a private phone conversation between two world leaders.  Yet on Wednesday morning - seven days after The Washington Post first reported the nature of the concerns raised by a whistleblower in the U.S. intelligence community and a day after House Democrats opened a formal impeachment inquiry into the president - the White House released a rough transcript of the call, part of a broad gamble by Trump that he could once again beat the forces arrayed against him.  "He didn't see anything wrong with the conversation he had with a foreign leader," said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., an ally of the president, referring to the call in which Trump offered his Ukrainian counterpart help from the Justice Department in investigating former vice president Joe Biden, a political rival.  The helter-skelter way the administration handled the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint could be a harbinger of the coming impeachment fight, with the White House scrambling to respond to a mercurial and frustrated president, who is increasingly sidelining his aides and making decisions based on gut instinct.  Even some allies of the president worry that his team may not fully understand the potential upheaval...</description>
