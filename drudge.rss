      <title>One question still dogs Trump: Why not try harder to solve crisis?</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/One-question-still-dogs-Trump-Why-not-try-harder-15436174.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both President Donald Trump's advisers and operatives laboring to defeat him increasingly agree on one thing: The best way for him to regain his political footing is to wrest control of the coronavirus.  In the six months since the deadly contagion was first reported in the United States, Trump has demanded the economy reopen and children return to school, all while scrambling to salvage his reelection campaign.  But both allies and opponents agree he has failed at the one task that could help him achieve all of his goals - confronting the pandemic with a clear strategy and consistent leadership.  Trump's shortcomings have perplexed even some of his most loyal allies, who increasingly have wondered why the president has not at least pantomimed a sense of command over the crisis or conveyed compassion for the millions of Americans impacted by it.  People close to Trump, many speaking anonymously to share candid discussions and impressions, say the president's inability to wholly address the crisis is due to his almost pathological unwillingness to admit error; a positive feedback loop of overly rosy assessments and data from advisers and Fox News; and a penchant for magical thinking that prevented him from fully engaging with the pandemic.  In recent weeks, with more than 146,000 Americans now dead from the virus, the White House has attempted to overhaul - or at least rejigger - its approach. The administration has revived news briefings led by Trump himself and presented the president with projections showing how the virus is now decimating Republican states full of Trump voters. Officials have also set up a separate, smaller coronavirus working group led by Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, along with Trump son-in-law and senior adviser...</description>

      <title>NASA rover Perseverance will prowl ancient lake bed on Mars for signs of life...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/NASA-rover-Perseverance-will-prowl-ancient-lake-15436341.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A $2.7 billion NASA rover is scheduled to blast off for Mars on Thursday on a mission that could help solve one of the greatest mysteries in all of science: the origin of life.  If all goes as planned, the rover, named Perseverance, will collect rock and soil samples that would later be space-mailed back to Earth for close scrutiny. Scientists will be looking for fossils or "biosignatures" of organisms that may have thrived about 3 billion years ago when theRedPlanet was much warmer and wetter.  "We have one data point for life on a planet," said planetary geologist Bethany Ehlmannof the California Institute of Technology, part of the science team for Perseverance. "Mars is the second data point. We know from the investments that we've made from exploration that there was this habitable world right next door. Right about the time that Earth was developing its life, Mars was also habitable, with lakes and rivers."  A close match between ancient Martian life and life here on Earth would suggest a common origin, with one planet seeding the other through meteorites. Or perhaps Mars had life-forms of a completely alien nature. Or maybe they never existed and Mars has always been a sterile world.  "Is it a foregone conclusion that as long as you have the right mix, things are going to happen and you're going to end up with life?" said Mary Voytek, head of NASA's astrobiology program. "We don't really have the answer to that."  The new rover mission is officially known as Mars 2020, and it is the first part of a multiphase project called the Mars Sample Return campaign, only this leg has been fully funded by Congress.  Perseverance will launch from Florida's Cape Canaveral atop an Atlas V rocket. It will be the second robotic mission to Mars in the span of a week: China on Thursday launched its own probe, named Tianwen-1, which...</description>

Young children with dogs have fewer social interaction problems than others...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Young-children-with-pet-dogs-seen-having-fewer-15436310.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young children with family dogs were 23 percent less likely to have social interaction problems than children whose households do not have a dog, some recent research suggests.  The finding comes from an analysis of data from a three-year study of 1,646 households with preschool children ages 2 to 5. Specifically, the researchers found that children who had a dog were 30 percent less likely to engage in antisocial behavior and 40 percent less likely to have problems interacting with other children than were youngsters from homes that did not include a dog.  In addition, children who had dogs were 34 percent more likely to engage in considerate behaviors, such as sharing or helping others. And the more time they spent playing with their dog the more a child was likely to be considerate - those who had three or more play sessions with their dog each week were 74 percent more likely to be consistently considerate compared with those who played less often.  One of the researchers said that the "mere presence of a family dog was associated with many positive behaviors and emotions." The study also noted that the "findings suggest that the benefits from owning a pet (dog) may commence early in childhood." The research did not, however, prove a cause-and-effect link between a dog and a child's behavior, stating that it could be coincidental that youngsters with good social and emotional development have dogs or that the families of children with dogs may offer more nurturing...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Realtor James Dietsche, there is only one way to describe the real estate market right now: "It's insane."  A 1950s style three-bedroom home he listed in late June for $200,000 in a small town outside Harrisburg, Pa., received 26 offers the initial weekend it was for sale. Many buyers were young couples seeking a starter home and retirees looking to downsize. But bids also came from Philadelphia, New York City and the Washington, D.C., area. One person was willing to pay up to $50,000 above asking. Several were offering to buy it without inspections.  While Dietsche's cellphone has been ringing with eager buyers, Tammy Steen's phone has been buzzing for a different reason. Her landlord keeps calling demanding the $700 rent she does not have. Steen, 52, was a hotel housekeeper at a Hampton Inn in Pensacola, Fla. Her temporary layoff now looks permanent. She has yet to receive unemployment aid despite applying in late March.
