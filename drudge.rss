      <title>Corporate debt nears record $10 trillion; Poses new risks..</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Corporate-debt-nears-a-record-10-trillion-and-14870792.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Little more than a decade after consumers binged on inexpensive mortgages that helped bring on a global financial crisis, a new debt surge - this time by major corporations - threatens to unleash fresh turmoil.  A decade of historically low interest rates has allowed companies to sell record amounts of bonds to investors, sending total U.S. corporate debt to nearly $10 trillion, or a record 47% of the overall economy.  In recent weeks, the Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund and major institutional investors such as BlackRock and American Funds all have sounded the alarm about the mounting corporate obligations.  The danger isn't immediate. But some regulators and investors say the borrowing has gone on too long and could send financial markets plunging when the next recession hits, dealing the real economy a blow at a time when it already would be wobbling.  Some of America's best-known companies, including AT&amp;T, Ford Motor and CVS Health, have splurged on borrowed cash. This year, the weakest firms have accounted for most of the growth and are increasingly using debt for "financial risk-taking," such as investor payouts and Wall Street dealmaking, rather than new plants and equipment, according to the IMF.  Amid the avalanche of debt, the sharp growth in lower-quality corporate bonds, just one notch above junk, represents a special concern. Investors hold nearly $4 trillion in these bonds, including $2.5 trillion from U.S. companies, according to the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's.  Since Oct. 1, familiar names like Hasbro, Nordstrom, Marriott and Hyundai all have tapped investors for cash by selling near-junk bonds that S&amp;P labels "BBB."  This low-quality corporate debt bulge, by itself, is unlikely to cause a recession, according to...</description>

      <title>Dem presidential campaign has produced confusion rather than clarity...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/The-Democratic-presidential-campaign-has-produced-14872449.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Democratic presidential candidates have been on the campaign trail for nearly a year. Confusion rather than clarity continues to be the story of their contest for the 2020 nomination.  Early in the year, the party's liberal wing seemed to be ascendant, defined by the candidacies of Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and the embrace of a single-payer, Medicare-for-all health-care program. Sanders and Warren were calling for other dramatic changes to the system - economic and political - and their voices stood out. Some other candidates offered echoes of their ideas.  That proved to be a misleading indicator of where the Democratic electorate was on some of the issues, particularly health care, in part because there were fewer moderate voices being heard. Former Vice President Joe Biden didn't join the race until April. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg wasn't being taken very seriously. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., wasn't breaking through.  The candidate debates provided the setting for the arguments to play out before a larger audience. Warren and Sanders came under attack from moderate Democrats at the first debate in June in Miami, with former Maryland congressman John Delaney the most vocal. But Warren and Sanders more than held their own. It appeared as though the progressive wing was on solid ground.  Subsequent debates, however, have produced a different impression. The progressives have been much more on the defensive and the moderates more assertive. Biden tangled with Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in the Detroit debate over the issue of health care. Harris subsequently modified her position, moving toward the center. On the issue of Medicare-for-all, the ground has shifted.  During the Atlanta debate in late November, even Sanders seemed to be tempering his overall message....</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Britain's Dec. 12 election is a bitter fight to shape the country's future, with voters not only hoping to chart the next steps of Brexit, but also picking between startlingly different visions of the country from right-wing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and left-wing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.  However, it isn't just British voters who are influencing Britain's future. A number of wealthy American individuals and organizations appear also to be having a big influence on this fraught British election.  The prominent left-leaning newspaper the Guardian reported Friday that 11 wealthy American donors have given a total of more than $3.7 million to influential right-wing British groups over the past five years.  One conservative American billionaire who was having an outsize influence on right-wing groups across the pond is no longer alive. John Templeton, who died in 2008, was behind a set of foundations that gave $3.3 million to British groups, the newspaper reported.  The news comes as Washington focuses on allegations of foreign influence on U.S. elections and is a reminder that outside the United States, the problem is often seen through the opposite lens: wealthy Americans seeking to influence foreign elections.  The U.S. donations in Britain do not appear to be illegal, and some of the think tanks involved have pushed back against the Guardian's framing. One recipient of Templeton-linked money, the Legatum Institute, told the paper that it had "a strong policy of maintaining intellectual independence" despite foreign financial backing.  In a statement in response to the article, the John Templeton Foundation, one of the organizations linked to the late investor, said that it was "proud to support academic research and civil dialogue in the natural sciences, human sciences, philosophy, classical liberalism, and...</description>

      <title>Ice preserved tiny puppy in near-perfect condition for 18,000 years. Scientists fascinated...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ice-preserved-a-tiny-puppy-in-near-perfect-14871919.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers have big outstanding questions about the puppy they have named Dogor - "friend" in a language of the Siberian area where the creature spent 18,000 years in permafrost.  They're still trying to figure out if the tiny animal is a dog or wolf. They wonder whether he could be part of the evolutionary bridge that turned a fierce wild animal into man's best friend.  They don't have to speculate about what Dogor looked like, however, because icy conditions have left him remarkably frozen in time. Scientists can touch his fur, lift his padded paws and pull back his lips to bare small, yellowed teeth.  "Fantastic, right?" says Dave Stanton, a research fellow at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm who has been scrutinizing the long-lost canine. "We have quite a lot of ancient samples. . . . But this has got be one of the best-preserved."  The puppy was discovered last year by locals in Yakutia, said Sergey Fedorov, who heads the exposition hall at the Mammoth Museum of Russia's North-Eastern Federal University. Dogor left the wilderness as a lump of soil and ice, but scientists could make out the head and paws of what they believed at first to be a young wolf.  Federov told The Washington Post that he carefully cleaned off dirt and debris to reveal near-intact fur - "extremely rare for animals of that time period."  "It's an amazing feeling, to see, touch and feel the history of earth," he said.  The puppy, whose name was announced earlier this week, remains in Russia. But he has caught the attention of researchers in Sweden and England who want to better understand Dogor's life and place in a still-mysterious evolution.  Testing on a rib bone has revealed the animal's age: about two months, said Stanton, a postdoctoral scholar who's been working for over a year on...</description>

      <title>Facing impeachment inquiry, Trump strives to look hard at work...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Facing-impeachment-inquiry-Trump-strives-to-look-14872290.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PALM BEACH, Fla. - As Democrats in Congress push to impeach him, President Donald Trump has toured a manufacturing plant in Texas, boasted about economic gains and signed numerous bills. He served turkey to U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving and grieved with the families of fallen service members at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.  And next week, Trump is scheduled to jet to London to meet with European allies and be received at Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II.  Sure, Trump has been consumed by the impeachment proceedings, popping off daily, if not hourly, about what he dubs a "hoax." But he and his aides also have staged photo opportunities and public events designed to showcase the president on the job - a strategy one year out from the election to convince the American people that he is hard at work for them at the same time that Democrats are trying to remove him from office.  "I'm working my ass off," Trump told a thunderous rally crowd of roughly 20,000 on Tuesday night in Sunrise, Florida. He added: "The failed Washington establishment is trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you and because we're winning. It's very simple."  Trump is taking a page out of the Clinton playbook. Then-President Bill Clinton survived his 1998 impeachment in part because the economy was roaring and because he appeared to many voters to be relentlessly focused on doing the business of the American people. When Clinton left office in 2001, Gallup measured his job approval rating at 66%.  Clinton had a built-in advantage that Trump does not enjoy: popularity. Throughout his second term, Clinton's approval rating hovered in the high 50s and 60s, whereas Trump's has been mired below 50%.  Still, Clinton's experience has been instructive to Trump, who recently met in the Oval Office with former Clinton strategist Mark...</description>
