      <title>Student faces 2 years behind bars for trying to hack Trump's taxes...</title>
      <link>https://www.cyberscoop.com/trump-tax-returns-hack-student-guilty-plea/</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.cyberscoop.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Philadelphia man has pleaded guilty in connection with a scheme to trick a U.S. government website into serving up the president’s tax returns. Andrew Harris, a student who attended Haverford College, admitted in court last week that he used a school computer and the Free Application for Student Aid website to try to access Donald Trump’s financial records. By opening a FAFSA account in the name of a Trump family member and using Trump’s Social Security number, Harris and another student apparently thought the FAFSA page would populate with Trump’s tax data. The attempt failed when the pair found a username and password for Trump already existed. Harris, 24, pleaded guilty on Sept. 5 to two misdemeanor counts of computer fraud. He faces two years in federal prison and a $200,000 fine. Another man, 22-year-old Justin Hiemstra of Minnesota, pleaded guilty last month. FAFSA is run by the Department of Education, …</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andrew Yang is doing what Beto O'Rourke could only dream of. The 2020 Democrat and entrepreneur was spotted performing what might be a presidential campaign first on Saturday: crowd surfing across a wave of supporters at the AAPI Democratic Presidential Forum in California. And if the sight of Yang's ride wasn't triumphant enough, the fact that two other presidential candidates were at the forum makes it even sweeter. Havenâ€™t crowdsurfed in a while #YangGang @GPSofficial pic.twitter.com/3ynxj8m21v â€” Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 8, 2019 Yang joined Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and billionaire Tom Steyer at the event, which is put on by an Asian American and Pacific Islander-focused super PAC. Yang is currently beating those two contenders in polls and number of legs off the ground, and is polling around the same 3 percent as fellow ex-punk O'Rourke. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>Actor would like everyone to stop being so cynical...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/863541/tom-hanks-like-everyone-stop-being-cynical</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the reasons why Tom Hanks decided to play Fred Rogers in the new movie A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is because he was drawn to the beloved television host's innate kindness. "Cynicism has become the default position for so much of daily structure and daily intercourse," Hanks told reporters at the Toronto Film Festival on Sunday. "Why? Because it's easy, and there's good money to be made. Cynicism is a great product to sell, and it's the perfect beginning of any examination of anything. And part of that is conspiracy theories and what have you." When Rogers started Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in the late 1960s, children were receiving negative messages on other programs, Hanks said. "Why would you put something that is cynical in front of a 2- or 3-year-old kid?" he asked. "That you are not cool because you don't have this toy? That it's funny to see someone being bopped on the head?" That's a poor way to treat the audience, and Rogers did the exact opposite. "We are allowed, I think, to feel good," Hanks said. "There's a place for cynicism, but why begin with it right off the bat?" Catherine Garcia</description>

      <title>Hezbollah downs Israeli drone...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Hezbollah-downs-Israeli-drone-in-ongoing-tension-14424127.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;JERUSALEM - Hezbollah announced Monday it had downed an Israeli drone in southern Lebanon, part of a string of clashes between Israel and Iranian-banked groups throughout the region.  The Israeli army also said early Monday that Iran's elite Quds Force oversaw the firing of several rockets from Syria toward Israel, none of which managed to reach their target.  The rocket attacks follow reports from Syrian opposition activists that several Iranians and allied militias were killed by airstrikes in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border. It was not immediately clear who had carried out these strikes, although Israel has launched a significant number of attacks on Iranian targets in Syria throughout the country's civil war.  In recent weeks, Israel has struck targets in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon to stop Iran from distributing sophisticated weapons within striking distance of its borders.  Although limited, Hezbollah's downing of a drone - seen as a possible retaliation for an earlier strike that the militant group blamed on Israel and which Jerusalem has yet to deny - and the rockets fired from Syria could be the latest salvos in the simmering tensions between Israel and Iran, Hezbollah's chief sponsor.  In a statement, Hezbollah said that its operatives shot down the Israeli drone outside the village of Ramyeh, across the border from northern Israel and that "it is now in their hands."  The Israeli Army confirmed in a statement that the drone had been shot down "on a routine mission in northern Israel" as it "fell into Lebanese territory." Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli Army, declined to comment on the specific nature of the drone's activities in Lebanon or if Israel had been involved in the strikes on Syrian territory.  "There is no risk of breach of...</description>
