      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Hello-from-Italy-Your-future-is-grimmer-than-you-15138082.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;My family lives in the Veneto, in Northern Italy, one of the regions worst-hit by the coronavirus. We are on lockdown. It's scary. It's lonely. It's uncomfortable. And did I mention scary?  I'll spare you the statistics and the sermons; both are already abundant. But I do want to make one thing clear: If you think that by stocking up your pantries you have absolved yourself from the responsibility of preparing for this virus, you are mistaken. This is a crisis like none before. Be skeptical of both naysayers and doomsayers; there's no way of knowing how this will end.  The restrictions came upon us slowly but steadily. Within two weeks, our old lives were gone. First the schools closed, then came social distancing. Then the government locked down the hardest-hit areas: no more going in and out of certain provinces; limited movements within the "red zones." Then the whole country shut down. Most stores closed their doors. People who could were asked to telework; those who could not, and did not have a job related to the continuation of essential services, were placed on part-time schedules or on unpaid leave. When we went out, we had to carry a pass explaining our reasons for being outside to show to the law enforcement officers patrolling the streets. The priority became keeping everyone inside, at all times.  For some people, the gradual rollout made these measures hard to accept: Skeptical observers questioned the seriousness of the disease, given that the restrictions were not draconian from the start. And yet without time to adjust to a progressive loss of freedom, we wouldn't have accepted it. We might have rebelled. Instead, we rallied, coming together as one - protecting one another's health, even as we could no longer socialize.  Living under these conditions is difficult to describe. We can leave the house only...</description>

      <title>COSTA:  Some Republicans remain skeptical of pandemic...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Some-in-GOP-remain-skeptical-of-coronavirus-15137350.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the weekend, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., a leading ally of President Donald Trump, dismissed concerns about the novel coronavirus pandemic and said on Fox News that "it's a great time to just go out, go to a local restaurant."  And former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, a Trump supporter who was pardoned last month, tweeted that "this hysteria is being created to destabilize the country and destroy" Trump.  But from Italy, where there is a national quarantine to try to slow the devastating effects of the coronavirus, Newt Gingrich offered a different perspective. The former House speaker wrote an opinion piece seeking to convince his fellow Republicans that not only was the pandemic very real, it required urgent action.  Inside the Republican Party and the conservative movement that Trump commands, there is now a deep divide as the nation confronts the coronavirus. For weeks, many on the right, including Trump, minimized the virus, if they considered it at all. Even in recent days, as much of the world shuts down to try to stop its spread, some Republicans mocked what they saw as a media-generated frenzy.  Their reaction reflected how the American right has evolved under Trump, moving from a bloc of small-government advocates to a grievance coalition highly skeptical of government, science, the news and federal warnings.  Their conspiratorial unrest is particularly acute within right-wing media, where Fox Business removed a prime-time anchor for casting the coronavirus as "another attempt to impeach the president." Other right-wing personalities continue to call the coronavirus a "hoax" or falsely blame George Soros, the billionaire investor and liberal donor, for causing it.  But conservatives and Republicans now face an undeniable reality as the pandemic's death count here and abroad climbs - and...</description>
