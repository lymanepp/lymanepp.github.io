      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — The steady loss of local newspapers and journalists across the country contributes to the nation's political polarization, a new study has found. With fewer opportunities to find out about local politicians, citizens are more likely to turn to national sources like cable news and apply their feelings about national politics to people running for the town council or state legislature, according to research published in the Journal of Communication.</description>

      <title>Warns of socialism coming to USA...</title>
      <link>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/01/30/howard_schultz_elizabeth_warrens_programs_will_lead_to_socialism_in_america.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Starbucks CEO and independent candidate for president Howard Schultz said he does not support the tax policies of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in an interview Wednesday on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe.' Schultz said Warren "believes in programs that will lead to a level of socialism." Schultz also revealed that when Warren sought a donation for her Senate campaign he declined because of her socialist agenda. "I've also been criticized for being a billionaire," Schultz said Wednesday. "Let's talk about that. I'm self-made. I grew up in the project in Brooklyn, New York. I thought that was the American dream, the aspiration of America. You're going to criticize me for -- for being successful when in my company over the last 30 years, the only company in America that gave comprehensive health insurance, equity in the form of stock options, and free college tuition? And Elizabeth Warren wants to criticize me for being successful?" "I don't believe what Elizabeth Warren stands for," Schultz said Wednesday. "I don't believe the country should be heading to socialism." "I think she believes in programs that will lead to a level of socialism in America. She's a smart woman. I respect her. This isn't personal. I just don't agree with her," he added. WILLIE GEIST, 'MORNING JOE' CO-HOST: So Senator Warren, as you know, put out a plan -- HOWARD SCHULTZ, INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT: Yes. GEIST: A 2-percent tax on people with $50 million or more in assets. SCHULTZ: Yes. GEIST: You called that plan ridiculous. SCHULTZ: Yes. GEIST: We show a poll earlier in the show that said the American public likes that idea a lot. And they hear someone like you with billions of dollars calling it ridiculous and say, of course, he wants to protect his own money. SCHULTZ: No. GEIST: What do you say to that? SCHULTZ: Well, if that plan was put in place, it probably could fund the government for a day or two. So that's not the answer. The answer is, let's take a step back from this. Let's not send out a tweet or a press release that make news. Let's get serious people around the table and solve this problem once and for all, which is comprehensive tax reform. GEIST: Do you think Elizabeth Warren's a serious person on taxes? SCHULTZ: I think she's a serious person, yes. MIKA BRZEZINSKI, 'MORNING JOE' CO-HOST: Yes. SCHULTZ: She -- she came to see me a few years ago and asked me for a contribution for her Senate race? BRZEZINSKI: Did you give it to her? SCHULTZ: I did not. BRZEZINSKI: OK. Wow. MIKE BARNICLE, 'MORNING JOE' CO-HOST: Why? SCHULTZ: I don't believe what Elizabeth Warren is -- what -- stands for. I don't -- I don't believe the country should be heading to socialism. BARNICLE: Do you think she's a socialist? SCHULTZ: I think she believes in programs that will lead to a level of socialism in America. She's a smart woman. I respect her. This isn't personal. I just don't agree with her.</description>

      <link>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/01/30/howard_schultz_im_a_billionaire_i_thought_that_was_the_american_dream.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MSNBC: Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is considering an Independent 2020 presidential bid, and he tells 'Morning Joe' why he doesn't believe what the Democratic Party stands for, why he sees himself as a legitimate Independent choice and what he really thinks about Elizabeth Warren. Schultz responded to critics of his personal fortune and being a billionaire in America. "I've also been criticized for being a billionaire," Schultz said Wednesday. "Let's talk about that. I'm self-made. I grew up in the project in Brooklyn, New York. I thought that was the American dream, the aspiration of America. You're going to criticize me for -- for being successful when in my company over the last 30 years, the only company in America that gave comprehensive health insurance, equity in the form of stock options, and free college tuition? And Elizabeth Warren wants to criticize me for being successful?" Interview highlights: Schultz: The government is not going to suddenly start working if a Democrat is elected. Schultz on criticism of being a billionaire: "I'm self-made. I grew up in the project in Brooklyn, New York. I thought that was the American's dream, the aspiration of America." He was incredulous that people like Sen. Elizabeth Warren would criticize him for being successful. Schultz said the government needs to be "interrupted" because it is not working and challenged the panel to name anything in government that works. "I'm not a Democrat," Schultz told the 'Morning Joe' panel. "I don't affiliate myself with the Democrat Party who is so far left, who basically wants the government to take over health care, which we cannot afford, the government to give free college to everybody and the government to give everyone a job, which basically is $40 trillion on the balance sheet of $21.5 trillion. We can't afford it." Schultz also revealed that Warren sought a donation from him for a Senate campaign and he declined because she's a "socialist." "She came to see me a few years ago and asked me for a contribution for her Senate race," he shared. "Did you give it to her?" co-host Mika Brzezinski inquired. "I did not," Schultz answered. "I don't believe what Elizabeth Warren stands for," Schultz said Wednesday. "I don't believe the country should be heading to socialism." "I think she believes in programs that will lead to a level of socialism in America. She's a smart woman. I respect her. This isn't personal. I just don't agree with her," he added.</description>

      <title>Tipsy Christie claims he'd be better prez than Trump...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/820632/chris-christie-says-hed-better-president-than-trump-boozy-late-show-stephen-colbert</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was Stephen Colbert's guest on Tuesday's Late Show, and at his request, they began the interview with tequila shots. "Where do you think the wheels came off during the shutdown?" Colbert asked. "The president blew it," Christie replied. "When?" Colbert asked, and Christie answered: "When he shut the government down with no plan on how to reopen it." Christie said he warned Trump beforehand that "if you're going to do this, you'd better have an exit plan." That obviously didn't happen, "and he got goose egg," Colbert said. "Yes, in politics, we call that getting rolled," Christie said. Christie said it hurts him "personally" when Trump undermines democracy by attacking the Justice Department and the FBI. So after two years, "do you regret at all helping this man get elected?" Colbert asked. Christie grabbed the bottle of tequila. He said in 2016 he preferred Trump to Hillary Clinton, "and I still agree with what his policies are more than I agree with Hillary Clinton's," but it's true Trump "has turned the Republican Party into something different that it was when I started to run for president." "Yeah, the Kremlin," Colbert joked. Colbert asked what Christie gets out of his 17-year friendship with the infamously transactional Trump. "He demands loyalty, he doesn't seem that loyal himself," Colbert said. "He'll toss anybody under the bus." "You think I don't know?" Christie asked, laughing. "I'm the guy who got fired from the transition." That stung, but "we have one president at a time, and if I can do anything to make him better, if I can do anything that helps the country, that's my job to do," he said. "Believe me, my wife ain't happy about it either." "Would you have been a better president than Trump?" Colbert asked. "Yes," Christie said, no hesitation. They ended with a spirited discussion of who exactly likes Christie anymore. Watch below. Peter Weber</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the better part of a decade, rumors about a serial killer haunted Toronto's Gay Village, a gentrifying neighborhood of rainbow-flag street signs and historic Victorian homes where bathhouses and X-rated video stores were slowly being replaced by banks and chain coffee shops. As one gay man after another disappeared under mysterious circumstances, residents canceled plans to go out, carried pepper spray on walks and made sure their neighbors knew when to expect them home. But in December 2017, the Toronto Police Service assured residents that there was no reason to believe that the community had a mass murderer on its hands.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CARACAS, Venezuela - Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro offered dialogue to the increasingly vigorous opposition Wednesday while warning the American people that intervening in his country could create new Vietnam-style quagmire. The dialogue offer, which has been made before, was immediately praised by Russian and drew a tweet from President Donald Trump, who said it came after increased U.S. pressure on the Venezuelan government and economy. "I am ready to sit down at the negotiating table with the opposition so that we could talk about what benefits Venezuela," Maduro said in an interview with Russian state media.</description>

A place where secret police or hidden microphones monitor every utterance. Where you're not allowed to check your phones or don modern underwear, or mention anything that's happened in the last half-century — or acknowledge that the whole thing is really just a film set.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sen. Kamala D. Harris spoke about health care at a CNN forum Monday evening, she threw her support behind a "Medicare-for-all" plan, sounding similar to other candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. But when pressed for details, the senator from California explained the idea in a way most Democrats assiduously avoid: She agreed that Medicare-for-all also means private insurance for none. "Let's eliminate all of that," Harris said, referring to private health insurance. "Let's move on." In a single flourish, Harris, D-Calif.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before announcing his presidential ambitions this week, former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz secretly undertook a months-long effort to prepare an independent presidential campaign against the nation's two-party political system, deploying more than six national polls and laying the groundwork for paid advertising that could debut in the next two months. The full reach of the project suggests that his stated goal of disrupting the U.S. political process is not likely to fade away anytime soon, despite enormous historical barriers to success and Democratic predictions that his entry in the race will help President Donald Trump get reelected. An early advertising effort, made possible by Schultz's net worth of about $3.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple has disabled a group-chat function in FaceTime after users said a software bug could let callers activate another person's microphone remotely. With the bug, a FaceTime user calling another iPhone, iPad or Mac computer could hear audio — even if the receiver did not accept the call. The bug is triggered when callers add themselves to the same call to launch a group chat. That makes FaceTime think the receiver had accepted the chat. The bug, demonstrated through videos online , comes as an embarrassment for a company that is trying to distinguish itself by stressing its commitment to users' privacy.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela's Supreme Court barred opposition leader Juan Guaido from leaving the country Tuesday, a move certain to heighten tensions as the man challenging President Nicolas Maduro's claim to the presidency presses forward with establishing a transitional government and the U.S. warns of "serious consequences" if he is harmed. The government-stacked high court announced the order just hours after chief prosecutor Tarek William Saab announced that he was opening a criminal investigation into Guaido's anti-government activities and requested that restrictions be placed on his movements abroad. The court also approved Saab's request that all of Guaido's financial assets be frozen.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple hoped to offset slowing demand for iPhones by raising the prices of its most important product, but that strategy seems to have backfired after sales sagged during the holiday shopping season. Now, CEO Tim Cook is grappling with his toughest challenge since replacing co-founder Steve Jobs 7 ½ years ago. Even as he tries to boost iPhone sales, Cook also must prove that Apple can still thrive even if demand doesn't rebound. It figures to be an uphill battle, given Apple's stock has lost one-third of its value in less than four months, erasing about $370 billion in shareholder wealth.</description>
