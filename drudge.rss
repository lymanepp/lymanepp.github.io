      <title>New iPhone creep out? Tiny holes scare...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Does-the-new-iPhone-creep-you-out-Scientists-14433714.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Apple debuted its newest iPhones on Tuesday, a striking new feature took center stage: a three-lens setup that puts a near-professional camera in the hands of anyone who can afford the $999 to $1099 devices. Three lenses are a lot better than two - unless they send you reeling in disgust.  That's the unexpected reaction thousands of Apple fans shared on social media as images spread of the back of the new phone, where the trio of lenses are crowded into a small square near the top left corner.  "The new iPhone is creeping me ... out with the 3 little cameras," one Twitter user wrote.  The backlash comes from people who say they suffer from an obscure and perplexing condition called "trypophobia" - a fear of clusters of small holes like those found in shoe treads, honeycombs and lotus seed pods. Essex University Professor Geoff Cole, a self-diagnosed trypophobe and researcher in the United Kingdom who studies the condition calls it "the most common phobia you have never heard of."  The phobia isn't recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which psychologists and psychiatrists use to diagnose patients. But self-described sufferers and some researchers claim the images can evoke a strong emotional response and induce itching, goose bumps, and even nausea and vomiting.  Trypophobia was only named in 2005 after the word began appearing on Reddit and in other online forums, like in a post by an Irish woman named Louise who belonged to an online community of self-described "weirdoes who have an irrational fear of HOLES."  Over the next decade, though, thousands of people have reported suffering from trypophobia. Support groups have popped up on social media. In 2016, Kendall Jenner raised the condition's profile when she wrote a blog post saying...</description>

      <title>WARREN TOPS POLL</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/864229/joe-biden-elizabeth-warren-are-tied-26-percent-new-poll</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is going nowhere but up. The 2020 candidate pulled off a rare showing in an Economist/YouGov poll published Wednesday, tying the largely untouchable former Vice President Joe Biden with 26 percent support among registered voters. It marks one of the few polls where Biden is within danger of losing his frontrunner status, and contains a dismal prediction for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Biden has only had a few close calls in previous polls, but Warren's 2020 rise has seemingly been eating away at his support as well as Sanders'. In a late August poll from Monmouth University, Sanders and Warren topped the pool with 20 percent support, and Biden was just behind at 19 percent. In this Economist/YouGov poll, Biden is back up, but so is Warren, both leaving Sanders a full 10 points behind at 16 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) meanwhile has largely lost her post-debate spike, tying South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 6 percent. And former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, once a frontrunner himself, joins the 1 percent crowd at the bottom of the barrel. 2020 National Democratic Primary:Warren 26%Biden 26%Sanders 16%Buttigieg 6%Harris 6%Booker 2%Yang 2%Bennet 1%Bullock 1%Castro 1%Gabbard 1%Klobuchar 1%O'Rourke 1%Williamson 1%@YouGovUS/@TheEconomist 9/8-10https://t.co/pzE25Io89q pic.twitter.com/UEdcNIs0hK â€” Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) September 11, 2019 The Economist/YouGov surveyed 1,500 American adults from Sept. 8â€“10, who were selected via an opt-in Internet panel.
