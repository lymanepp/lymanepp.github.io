      <title>Growing chorus pushes for renewed shutdown orders...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Growing-chorus-pushes-for-renewed-shutdown-orders-15398322.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;They raced to shut down their economies in March, and many opened them just as quickly in May.  Now, governors across the country are facing growing pressure from public health experts and local leaders to reimpose stay-at-home orders as the only way to regain control of coronavirus outbreaks that threaten to overwhelm hospitals and send the death count spiraling.  The push appeared to receive a boost from Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease official, who suggested in comments released late Wednesday that struggling states "should seriously look at shutting down."  He took a more measured approach on Thursday, emphasizing that stay-at-home orders should remain a last resort and suggesting a pause in reopening plans instead.  So far, that has been the preferred method for governors seeking to arrest climbing caseloads while not alienating a virus-weary public. Yet, with scant evidence of progress in states across the Sun Belt - and beyond - experts are increasingly concluding that more drastic measures are necessary.  "Stay-at-home is a blunt instrument," said Farshad Fani Marvasti, director of public health at Arizona State University. "But when you're leading the world in new cases and things don't seem to be getting better, you may have to use that blunt instrument."  Studies have found that orders that closed nonessential businesses and forbid nonessential travel or gatherings prevented millions of coronavirus cases nationwide when they were imposed this spring. Researchers have also found such orders could have saved tens of thousands of lives had they been implemented earlier.

      <title>Trump could lose and not leave. But Cabinet members who try to help face prison...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/opinion/article/Trump-could-lose-and-not-leave-But-Cabinet-15396854.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With November fast approaching, here's a recurring question that can't easily be dismissed as alarmist fretting or grim humor: What if President Donald Trump loses his bid for re-election but refuses to concede and instead clings to power? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed this concern last year, saying "we have to inoculate against that." So did Trump's prison-bound former lawyer Michael Cohen. Testifying before Congress, Cohen said, "I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, that there will never be a peaceful transition of power." Even Joe Biden, Trump's Democratic rival, doesn't discount the possibility that Trump would make himself difficult to dislodge, but he suggested that others in government would get the job done: "I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced that they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch."  If Trump does try to hang on to a presidency he's lost, however, he can't actually do very much all by himself. Running the executive branch requires help. Thankfully, there are laws that stop others from using the authorities of the executive branch on behalf of anyone other than the legitimate president. If William Barr, for example, tried to exercise the powers of the attorney general after a Trump loss, he could be subject to criminal prosecution.  The circumstances matter. If Trump legitimately wins on Election Day, he wins - so be it. And if he loses, well, American tradition calls for a peaceful transfer of power to one's successor. But given Trump's rampant tradition-busting, there's more than a little reason to worry that he'll continue to reassert baseless claims that there was election fraud via mail-in ballots or foreign election interference favoring the Democrats, even after he has failed to persuade lawfully constituted authorities of such fantasies. Whatever Trump's...</description>

      <title>Republicans look into holding their convention outdoors...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Republicans-look-into-outdoor-convention-15396942.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Republican convention in Jacksonville, Fla., next month could be moved to an outdoor stadium as cases of the novel coronavirus in the state increase, according to several officials with knowledge of the plans.  While no decision has been made, Republican officials are studying two outdoor professional sports stadiums near the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena where the convention is currently slated to be held. They are also looking more broadly into the logistics of pulling off an outdoor convention, according to two Republicans involved in the planning.  This marks the latest uncertainty over planning the convention, which President Donald Trump is determined to hold even as cases surge in Florida and other states. Officials have engaged in weeks of intensive planning for the convention, which was moved from North Carolina after a sharp disagreement with state leaders there over health measures.  Trump was recently briefed on the options of moving the convention away from the indoor arena, officials said, and is expected to make a final decision in upcoming days.  Republicans involved in the planning believe there could be less risk of transmission and spreading for attendees in a larger outdoor arena than in the stadium, and attendees may be less concerned about taking part in such an event.  Several Republican senators have said they will not attend the convention.  After the president's rally last month in Tulsa, some of his advisers are also concerned about the potential fallout from indoor events where attendees do not wear masks.  An outdoor convention could pose its own set of problems, however. Florida is particularly hot in the summer, with temperatures often climbing to 100 degrees, and rain is also a threat.  Republican officials have looked at the 121...</description>

      <title>Houston the new NYC? </title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/924461/houston-starting-look-like-new-york-city-before-peak-covid19-crisis</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Texas reported a record 98 confirmed COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday and 9,979 new cases, just shy of Tuesday's record 10,028 cases. Austin is turning its convention center, more famous for hosting South by Southwest, into a field hospital. In Houston, hospitals took in 3,851 coronavirus patients on Tuesday, and a growing number of people are dying at home before the paramedics even arrive, ProPublica and NBC News reported Wednesday, citing Houston Fire Department data. 'The uptick in the number of people dying before they can even reach a hospital in Houston draws parallels to what happened in New York City in March and April,' ProPublica and NBC News report. 'These increases also echo those reported during outbreaks in Detroit and Boston, when the number of people dying at home jumped as coronavirus cases surged.' 'In Houston, doctors who knew the situation in New York are saying that what's happening there looks like what happened in New York in early April,' New York Times science reporter Donald MacNeil said on The Daily podcast over the weekend. 'Not as many dying yet, but with people on oxygen and on ventilators they may find themselves in the situation where they have to park refrigerated trucks behind hospitals to hold the bodies, as they did in New York.' 'It's certainly not as bad as it was in New York City,' Dr. Hilary Fairbrother, a Houston emergency medicine doctor, told NBC News. 'We are not at that point. That being said, everybody wants to prevent us getting to that point.' Houston has also benefited from New York's experience, Dr. Diana Fide, a Houston emergency room doctor and president of the Texas Medical Association, told Politico. 'We did learn a lot going through things in March and April. We learned so much from problems in Washington State and New York.' Even with more knowledge and stockpiled ventilators and protective equipment, she added, burnout is a real risk 'The fear is that nobody really knows what the trajectory is,' reports New York Times correspondent Sheri Fink from Houston Methodist Hospital, the city's largest. 'You can have models, but models only can do so much. It really, really depends on human behavior â€” whether they stay home more, whether they wear masks. And then there could just be mysteries that we don't even understand about how this virus passes. And those numbers for now, they just keep rising.' Peter Weber</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/200-000-seafarers-fear-there-s-no-plan-to-get-15396336.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like thousands of other seafarers, Karika Neethling wanted to get home as the coronavirus pandemic convulsed the cruise industry in March. Her anxiety grew more desperate when she learned she was pregnant.  But for nearly three months, the 27-year-old South African was caught in a web of border restrictions and corporate bureaucracy, shuttled on ships between ports in the Bahamas and Italy as her employer, MSC Cruises, worked to get its crews home.  "I don't think we were ever priorities," said Neethling, who worked as a shop employee aboard the luxury liner the MSC Preziosa. "I was depressed and in despair thinking I might have this baby on the ship."  Neethling isn't alone. While she's finally home in Johannesburg, more than 200,000 more seafarers remain trapped on ships around the world, from cargo vessels and oil tankers to luxury cruise liners. Restrictions on ships docking to halt the spread of Covid-19, border shutdowns and a lack of flights are the biggest barriers to relieving exhausted crew. But shipping lines and cruise companies are also coming under increasing pressure to do more.  MSC said it's been working with governments and ports to get workers home as quickly as possible, prioritizing pregnant seafarers. The company said in a statement that a "small number" of pregnant crew members across its fleet "have had to stay on board awaiting repatriation despite our best efforts to secure safe passage home for them."  How much responsibility companies bear for workers trapped at sea is a growing point of contention. That leaves one of the world's most vulnerable working populations, some who have been stuck on board for more than a year, at increased risk and could have a knock-on effect that reverberates through the shipping industry and global economy.  "Pressure to change crew has increased dramatically,"...</description>

      <title>Senate GOP candidates in tight races avoid any mention of president in campaign ads...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Senate-GOP-candidates-in-tight-races-avoid-any-15396155.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his most recent television ad, Colorado's Cory Gardner cheerfully touts an outdoor conservation bill he recently wrote. Arizona's Martha McSally denounces "communist China" in her 30-second clips. And North Carolina's Thom Tillis showcases his humble roots in a trailer park as he vows to protect jobs for American workers.  Missing from the spate of ads: President Donald Trump.  Republican senators up for reelection this fall in tight races have been unwilling to publicly criticize Trump as he continues to fan racial tensions and struggles to control a pandemic that has devastated the economy and killed close to 130,000 Americans. But they are being careful not to embrace him either.  In their campaign ads back home, it's as if the unpopular incumbent president doesn't exist, as Republicans choose instead to highlight their own achievements or go on the attack against their Democratic challengers.  This deliberate approach underscores the difficult position Republicans find themselves in as they head into an election season that looks increasingly grim for the party. The senators don't want to clash with Trump and rile up his stable of loyal supporters whose votes they will need to be reelected, but they also don't want to hug him tightly him and turn off more moderate voters whose views of the president have turned negative.  "The sweet spot is finding real ways to show your independence and to do it in ways that don't antagonize the base," said Republican strategist Matt Gorman, vice president at the GOP consulting firm Targeted Victory.  It's a balancing act that could give even a tightrope walker vertigo.  Trump's sagging popularity is one of several challenges confronting Senate Republicans as they face a dire outlook in their bid to retain the majority this fall....</description>
