      <title>How legal fight against big tech is like fight against organized crime...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/opinion/article/The-legal-fight-against-big-tech-is-like-the-15451330.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Wednesday, the House's top antitrust subcommittee grilled big-tech CEOs Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos, who appeared via videoconferencing software. Some people called it tech's "Big Tobacco moment" while others compared it with past antitrust investigations of Microsoft and AT&amp;T. To me, the hearing - and the ongoing investigations - conjured another set of hearings from 70 years ago: the probe into mob activity led by Sen. Estes Kefauver, D-Tenn.  Those hearings led to a wave of enforcement, new laws and eventually, in 1970, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. What we learned at Wednesday's hearing suggests the behavior of Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon calls for a comparably comprehensive and forceful response. (Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)  There are more than a few similarities between the organized crime and these four companies. Like the Mafia, the threats that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google pose to American democracy flow from the power they have over key services (from email to social media to music and film), the way they use dominance in one area to achieve dominance in others and their ability to use fear to stop challenges to their control.  Like the Mafia, they are a resilient, surveillance-based shadow government. So citizens are dual subjects - of the country, and of the flawed online markets created by these companies. Like the mob, big tech has friends in very high places. Likewise, big tech is an oligarchy with several bosses, who compete in some territories but generally divide power among themselves, without consulting elected officials.  Obviously, I am not saying Facebook and Google murder and kneecap their opponents, or burn down businesses that refuse to play by their rules; I am not equating tech...</description>
