      <title>Surgeon implants electrodes in patient's brain to cure opioid use...</title>
      <link>https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Surgeon-implants-electrodes-in-patient-s-brain-in-14814847.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.seattlepi.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A surgeon has implanted electrodes in the brain of a patient suffering from severe opioid use disorder, hoping to cure the man's intractable craving for drugs in the first such procedure performed in the United States.  The device, known as a deep brain stimulator, is designed to alter the function of circuits in the man's brain. It has been used with varying degrees of success in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, dystonia, epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder and even depression. It is seen as a last resort therapy after the failure of standard care, such as medication that reduces the craving for drugs.  The deep brain stimulator, which functions much like a heart pacemaker, was implanted by Ali Rezai, executive chairman of the West Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute. His patient, 33-year-old hotel worker Gerod Buckhalter, said he had been unable to remain sober for more than four months since the age of 15, despite trying a variety of medications and other inpatient and outpatient treatments.  Buckhalter is the first of four people in a pilot program, which aims to demonstrate that the technique is safe so that a full-scale clinical trial can be conducted. It is aimed at a small percentage of opioid abusers with the most treatment-resistant cravings for opioids, who may face a lifetime of overdoses, relapses, inability to hold a job and other consequences of addiction.  The seven-hour surgery was performed Friday and the school announced it Tuesday.  "I'm not advocating for deep brain stimulation as a first line or a second line [treatment]," Rezai said. "It's for people who have failed everything, because it is brain surgery."  Rezai's surgical team opened a hole in Buckhalter's skull about the size of a nickel, then inserted four wires into his nucleus accumbens, a part of the brain's...</description>

      <title>Ex-TWITTER employees charged with spying for Saudi Arabia...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Former-Twitter-employees-charged-with-spying-for-14815126.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The Justice Department has charged two former Twitter employees with spying for Saudi Arabia in a case that raises concerns about the ability of Silicon Valley to protect the private information of dissidents and other users from repressive governments.  The charges, unveiled Wednesday in San Francisco, came a day after the arrest of one of the former Twitter employees, Ahmad Abouammo, a U.S. citizen who is alleged to have spied on the accounts of three users - including one whose posts discussed the inner workings of the Saudi leadership - on behalf of the government in Riyadh.  Abouammo is also charged with falsifying an invoice to obstruct an FBI investigation.  The second former Twitter employee - Ali Alzabarah, a Saudi citizen - was accused of accessing the personal information of more than 6,000 Twitter accounts in 2015 on behalf of Saudi Arabia. One of those accounts belonged to a prominent dissident, Omar Abdulaziz, who later became close to Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who was killed by Saudi government agents last year.  Prosecutors said a third individual, Saudi citizen Ahmed Almutairi, acted as an intermediary between Saudi officials and the Twitter employees. He is also charged with spying. Alzabarah and Almutairi are believed to be in Saudi Arabia. Analysts said it is the first time federal prosecutors have publicly accused Saudis of spying in the United States.  The case is noteworthy in that it targets a strategic Middle East ally, whose de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been linked by the CIA to Khashoggi's killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.  "The criminal complaint unsealed today alleges that Saudi agents mined Twitter's internal systems for personal information about known Saudi...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;postguild.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Post has never conducted and released to the public a comprehensive pay study of its own. So this year, Post Guild decided to do one itself. Our union contract with Post management mandates that the company give us pay data on Guild-covered employees on an annual basis. We requested this information in July 2019 and spent four months analyzing the data, a reporting effort led by Pulitzer Prize-winning data journalist Steven Rich and supported by a team of dozens of other Post Guild members. We took care to protect the integrity of the data and the privacy of our members. The result of those efforts is this new report — the most comprehensive study to date of pay at The Washington Post.</description>

      <title>SHOWTIME: Trial opens for Roger Stone...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Trial-opens-for-Roger-Stone-accused-of-lying-14813736.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Federal prosecutors and attorneys for Roger Stone, a longtime friend of President Donald Trump, are set to deliver opening statements Wednesday in the final criminal case charged in former special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.  Stone, 67, , has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering about efforts to gather information about Democratic emails prosecutors say were stolen by Russia during the 2016 campaign and released through the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.  Stone, a longtime Trump adviser and political consultant, was charged in January in a seven-count indictment. Prosecutors contend he lied on several points: when he told the House Intelligence Committee in September 2017 that he did not have texts or emails about his 2016 discussions surrounding WikiLeaks; said that he had only one associate who tried to act as a go-between with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange; and claimed he never spoke to anyone in the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks' plans.  Stone was in close contact with Trump campaign about WikiLeaks, indictment shows  The federal trial before Judge Amy Berman Jackson is expected to last about two weeks.  A trove of Stone's communications with Trump insiders including exchanges with former chief strategist Stephen Bannon, campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and Manafort deputy Rick Gates likely will figure prominently given allegations in the charges. The trial overall could offer a sharper look at the eagerness of some in Trump's orbit to find damaging information to derail Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential run.  Stone, a self described "agent provocateur" of American conservative politics, has said any misstatements he made were...</description>
