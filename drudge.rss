      <title>Gender gap grows wider...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Analysis-On-impeachment-gender-gap-grows-wider-14867936.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - One of the most enduring themes of this administration - women dislike President Donald Trump at historically high rates, while men are more tolerant of his actions - is only getting more fortified with the impeachment debate.  Poll after poll shows a clear majority of women support both Trump's impeachment in the House and a conviction in the Senate that would remove him from office, while roughly 6 in 10 men oppose such an outcome.  A Washington Post-ABC News poll, taken just before public hearings began, found that 56% of women supported impeachment and removing Trump from office, while just 4o% of women want the president to stay in office. By contrast, 54% of men oppose impeachment, the poll showed.  The gender gap, as it is known, has been studied for decades, and each side has usually tried to mitigate its weakness in the run-up to elections. GOP strategists frequently try to make their candidates appeal a bit more to women, while Democrats search for better inroads to male voters.  But the Trump era has made it an entrenched fact of life with bigger disparities than previous presidencies, and that is playing out in the contours of the impeachment battle: The Democratic-led House will vote to impeach Trump, while the Republican-led Senate will vote to acquit.  Just look at the 2018 midterm elections, when 59% of women voted for the Democratic congressional candidate, and 51% of men voted for the Republican candidate.  "The gender gap in voting preference is not new, but it is at least as wide as at any point over the past two decades,' a Pew Research Center analyst wrote after the midterms.  In spring 2018, 56% of women had identified as Democrats or voters who leaned Democratic, one of the highest levels of female support for Democrats since 1992,...</description>

      <title>Texas plant explosion releases chemical plume...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/texas/article/Plant-explosion-in-Texas-blows-windows-from-homes-14865898.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PORT NECHES, Texas (AP) - Three workers were injured early Wednesday in a massive explosion at a Texas chemical plant that also blew out the windows and doors of nearby homes.  Firefighters worked to contain a blaze that erupted after the blast at the TPC Group plant and sent a large plume of smoke stretching for miles.  The three workers who were injured during the blast -two TPC employees and a contractor - have been treated and released from hospitals in Port Arthur and Houston, said Troy Monk, TPC's director of health, safety and security.  About 30 employees were working at the plant at the time of the explosion and all have been accounted for, according to TPC.  The plant in Port Neches in southeast Texas, about 80 miles east of Houston, makes chemical and petroleum-based products.  Monk said the blast occurred in an area of the plant that makes butadiene, a chemical used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber and other products. He said the plant has 175 full-time employees and 50 contract workers.  Monk said TPC does not know what caused the explosion, but it will form an investigation team to determine what happened.  "We're staying focused on the safety of our emergency response personnel folks in and around in the community as well as trying to protect the environment," Monk said at a news conference.  TPC officials know that at least three tanks have been damaged by the blaze, but firefighters have not been able to fully assess damage at the plant as they remain in a defensive position, Monk said.  Jefferson County Judge Jeff Branick said at the news conference that he was awakened at his home by the blast, which blew in his front and back doors, "damaging them pretty significantly."  Jefferson County Emergency Management coordinator Mike White...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, negotiated earlier this year to represent Ukraine's top prosecutor for at least $200,000 during the same months that Giuliani was working with the prosecutor to dig up dirt on Vice President Joe Biden, according to people familiar with the discussions.  The people said that Giuliani began negotiations with Ukraine's top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko, about a possible agreement in February. In the agreement, Giuliani's company would receive payment to represent Lutsenko as the Ukrainian sought to recover assets he believed had been stolen from the government in Kyiv, those familiar with the discussions said.  The talks occurred as Giuliani met with Lutsenko in New York in January and then in Warsaw in February while he was also gathering information from Lutsenko on two topics Giuliani believed could prove useful to Trump: the involvement of Biden, and his son, Hunter, in Ukraine and allegations that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election.  Trump ultimately pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open investigations into the two issues during a July 25 phone call between the two leaders, a call that sparked a whistleblower complaint and the Congressional impeachment inquiry.  A person familiar with the negotiations described a series of contracts that were drafted earlier this year in which Giuliani would have worked for Lutsenko or separately, the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice.  For Lutsenko, the agreement would have provided a pipeline to Trump's lawyer and, through him, potentially to other top U.S. officials. For Giuliani, the agreements would have been a way to accrue financial benefit from a person who was also providing him politically damaging information that could help another client, the president of the United States.
