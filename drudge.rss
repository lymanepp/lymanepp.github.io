PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) — More than 600 swimmers from 13 countries have stroked their way through one of Russia's most scenic and historic settings, circling the St. Petersburg island that holds the Peter and Paul Fortress.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.seattlepi.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 29-year-old man stole a Horizon Air passenger plane from Sea-Tac International Airport and took off on Friday night, circling the area for a short time and performing stunts while being chased by military jets before crashing near Tacoma.  The unnamed Pierce County man flying the Q400 twin-engine turboprop engaged in a lengthy back and forth negotiation with air traffic control where he mentioned not intending to land the aircraft, before the fiery crash on Ketron Island in North Pierce County, just south of Tacoma. There were reportedly no passengers or other personnel on board.</description>
