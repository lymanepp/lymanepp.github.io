      <title>In Virginia, Republicans confront a fearful electoral future... </title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/In-Virginia-Republicans-confront-a-fearful-14822976.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RICHMOND, Va. - As Virginia election returns rolled in Tuesday night, Republican campaign manager Daniella Propati quickly realized two things: Her candidate for the House of Delegates, GayDonna Vandergriff, would lose, and calling their opponent a "socialist" hadn't worked.  North Richmond and the tony suburbs of Henrico County had once been a dependable backstop for the GOP, a place where statewide candidates found votes to offset Arlington and Alexandria. But the suburbs have undergone a metamorphosis in recent years - growing more socially liberal, more diverse, less interested in the red meat of the tea party and Donald Trump.  "Republicans - we've been running campaigns in Virginia the same way for 20 years," Propati said. "We need to come together and say, 'What do we need to do next time?' "  That's a question Republicans around the country are wrestling with after Tuesday's elections revealed new troubles in suburbs from Memphis to Philadelphia. Nowhere has the problem been more pronounced than in Virginia, where Republicans have been all but wiped from power in the past decade.  A GOP candidate hasn't won statewide office in Virginia since 2009. On Tuesday, Democrats gained majorities in both houses of the General Assembly for the first time in a generation; the House of Delegates swung from a 66-34 Republican edge in 2017 to a 55-45 Democratic advantage for next year's session.  In presidential elections, Virginia has moved so swiftly to the left in recent contests that it barely paused to be a swing state.  "This is the nightmare scenario for a lot of people in the Republican Party," said Ruy Teixeira, a demographer at the liberal Center for American Progress. "Virginia is an example of a possible future for some of the states that are now part of the...</description>

      <title>Billionaires take center stage in national politics, colliding with populist Dems...</title>
      <link>https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/America-s-billionaires-take-center-stage-in-14822820.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.newstimes.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The political and economic power wielded by the approximately 750 wealthiest people in America has become a sudden flash point in the 2020 presidential election, as the nation's billionaires push back with increasing ferocity against calls by liberal politicians to vastly reduce their fortunes and clout.  On Thursday, Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire and former mayor of New York City, took steps to enter the presidential race, a move that would make him one of four billionaires who either plan to seek or have expressed interest in seeking the nation's highest office in 2020. His decision came one week after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., proposed vastly expanding her "wealth tax" on the nation's biggest wealth holders and one month after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said America should not have any billionaires at all.  The populist onslaught has ensnared Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, led to billionaire hand-wringing on cable news, and sparked a panicked discussion among wealthy Americans and their financial advisers about how to prepare for a White House controlled by populist Democrats.  Past presidential elections have involved allegations of class warfare, but rarely have those debates centered on such a small subset of people.  "For the first time ever, we are having a national political conversation about billionaires in American life. And that is because many people are noticing the vast differences in wealth and opportunity," said Timothy Naftali, a historian at New York University.  The growing hostilities between the ascendant populist wing of the Democratic Party and the nation's tech and financial elite have spilled repeatedly into public view over the past several months, but they reached a crescendo last week with news that Bloomberg may enter the Democratic primary....</description>

      <title>Farm family struggles to recover after rising debt pushes husband to suicide...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/A-farm-family-struggles-to-recover-after-rising-14822724.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PLATTE, S.D. - Amber Dykshorn stood at her kitchen window and watched the storm come in.  It was a very dark Saturday night in the middle of the summer in the middle of a year that is on track to be the wettest in more than a century. The wind blew over the farm, the rain came down and she heard the ominous pings on her roof - pea-sized hail, striking the still-fragile stalks of the only corn her husband, Chris Dykshorn, was able to plant before he took his own life in June.  Did their crop insurance cover hail damage? She had no idea. That was something Chris would have taken care of, if he were here. Instead she was alone, with nearly $300,000 in farm debt, three kids ages 5 to 13 and a host of grief-fueled questions. Why hadn't she been able to save him? What would happen to them now?  She scrolled through his final texts, rereading his words, leaning on the kitchen counter next to a whiteboard with the kids' chore list - Kahne: dishwasher, Kalee: dust living room - and a book someone gave her titled "Through a Season of Grief: Devotions for Your Journey from Mourning to Joy."  Chris had been despondent over the couple's finances, crippled by surplus grain he couldn't sell because of the trade war and flooded fields.  "I'm struggling so bad today. I don't know what to do anymore," he texted on May 31. "I seriously don't know how we r gonna make it."  On June 1: "I just want to sit in the house and cry."  And then: "What am I supposed to do. I am failing and feel like I'm gonna lose everything I've worked for the past how many years."  She was still asleep the morning of June 13 when he went to the utility room to get his gun.  In farm country, mental health experts say they're seeing more suicides as families endure the worst period for U.S. agriculture in decades. Farm...</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/House-Democrats-engineer-a-trio-of-opportunities-14822517.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - It's rare in politics to get a second chance, let alone a third, at making a first impression. But that is the opportunity presented to House Democrats in the week ahead, as they take their impeachment inquiry public, searching for a much sharper focus than previous oversight hearings that tended to backfire.  The House Intelligence Committee, in a pair of hearings with career diplomats, hopes to do what other panels have failed to do in their previous attempts at high-profile investigations of President Trump: deliver a dramatic rendering of the facts that are easily understood by the average voter and make clear how those actions represent abuses of power that are considered high crimes and misdemeanors.  Having learned lessons about those previous mistakes, Democrats fashioned the resolution formalizing the impeachment inquiry to address several procedural hiccups that they believe will make these new hearings more dramatic. And, more broadly, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has recently begun to hold weekly huddles with the Democrats who are most often on TV news shows talking about the investigation. The purpose is to work on message and drive home the importance of keeping the focus on Trump's actions and not getting distracted by side characters, such as the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.  So far, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has won accolades from Democrats for an approach that is getting three bites of the media apple with each witness. First, Schiff and two other committees conducting the investigations brought them behind closed doors for depositions - some portions of which got leaked. Then, over the past week, the committees publicly released the transcripts of key witnesses, confirming what had already leaked and revealing new damaging...</description>

      <title>In Bahamas, hard-hit island beckons again...</title>
      <link>https://www.nhregister.com/lifestyle/travel/article/In-the-Bahamas-a-hard-hit-island-beckons-again-14820327.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.nhregister.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tip Burrows dropped a low-grade expletive when she saw the beach by Banana Bay Restaurant, on the south side of Grand Bahama Island.  "Holy (bad word)!" said the islander, peering into a freshly carved trench. "That wasn't here before."  Nearly two months after Hurricane Dorian battered the Bahamas, Tip, who runs the Humane Society of Grand Bahama, was still discovering new evidence of destruction. On this mid-October afternoon, she had unearthed an inlet on Fortune Beach. As if that weren't alarming enough, the storm surge that had swept away a section of the beach had not come from the ocean lapping at Fortune's feet. It had traversed the island from the north and pushed the sand out to sea like a scene from an eco-horror film.  "We lost two feet of beach," said Danilo Rulli, the restaurant's owner, "but it will slowly come back."  And so will the Bahamas, at possibly an even faster clip than Mother Nature.  "We're going to bring the sparkle back to Grand Bahama," said Steven Johnson, an official with the Grand Bahama Tourism Office who is already working on new initiatives, such as expanding the West End as a seafood destination.  To be sure, Dorian was devastating. The strongest storm ever to strike the Bahamas caused at least 65 deaths and damaged or destroyed more than 13,000 homes on Grand Bahama Island and the Abaco Islands, both in the upper reaches of the 500-mile-long archipelago. Economic loss could rise to $7 billion, more than half of the country's gross national product. But the Bahamas are moving forward - rebuilding homes, reopening businesses, and restoring the spirit of the islands and its people.  "We'll be back bigger and better than before," exclaimed a resident who lives in the East End, the hardest-hit area on Grand Bahama Island.  The Bahamas can...</description>

Hundreds of records could fall in next week's cold snap...</title>
      <link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/article/Hundreds-of-records-could-fall-in-next-week-s-14820980.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.mysanantonio.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Arctic blast engulfing the eastern half of the Lower 48 will make mid-November feel like mid-January. Between Sunday and Wednesday, temperatures will sink to levels 15 to 30 degrees colder than normal from the Plains to the East Coast.  The National Weather Service is predicting that about 250 cold records will be established as a result of this polar plunge, from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes.  Next week's cold is the second and stronger of back-to-back Arctic fronts sweeping across the nation.  The first front raced from the Midwest to the East Coast between Wednesday and Friday this week. It caused temperatures to drop 15 to 20 degrees in 24 hours along the Eastern Seaboard between Thursday and Friday morning and supported the season's first snow flurries in Washington, D.C.  But temperatures are poised to take an even deeper dive as the second front invades.  The cold front will drop into the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest on Saturday night into Sunday, passing through Minneapolis and Chicago.  On Monday morning, the front will have rapidly progressed eastward, stretching from interior New England southwest to Texas, having sliced through Buffalo, Detroit, Cleveland, Kansas City, St. Louis and Oklahoma City.  By Tuesday morning, it will have reached the East Coast, having passed through all but southeast South Carolina and Florida, which it will cross by Wednesday morning.  On Monday, when the core of the cold grips the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes, Minneapolis will not escape the high teens while Chicago hovers in the 20s. Both cities are likely to see their coldest Veterans Day on record.  "Record low-max and record low mins could be in jeopardy of being tied/broken for both Monday and Tuesday," wrote the National Weather Service office serving Chicago....</description>
