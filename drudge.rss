      <title>JANE FONDA:  Take our country back one person at a time...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/opinion/article/The-only-way-to-take-back-our-country-is-one-14402710.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm scared. I'm scared for our democracy, for our ability to live together in community across lines of race, class and religion. I'm scared for my grandchildren and for the planet. The country is contorted and polarized, with the flames of hate fanned by leaders at the highest level. But I saw a path forward recently in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where I spent a hot, humid evening knocking on doors with Working America. (By the way, when I do this, I only give my first name and am rarely recognized.)  Steve, in his 40s, had a bad day at work but was willing to speak with me. He said there's no politician who will fight for him. He doesn't trust any of them. That's why he doesn't pay attention to any news. He voted for the Green Party last time as a protest, but he also doesn't like immigrants getting public benefits. We learned all of this because, like with every Working America conversation, we started the conversation by asking Steve what mattered to him, what was on his mind. At the end of our questions, Steve said, "Can I ask you something? Why do you do this?" He wanted to keep talking.  Edith is in her 50s. She likes what Trump has done but doesn't like the way he talks sometimes. She thinks cutting government red tape is important and she's concerned about outside interference in our election. As we were leaving, she told us, and maybe herself, "I don't talk to anyone. Why did I just talk to you?"  Last year in San Diego, Sharon said she was 100% for Trump, but when I told her Trump's health-care bill would allow her son's insurance company to stop covering him because he has a serious preexisting condition, she seemed to stop breathing for a moment. "I had no idea," she gasped. "I can't let that happen."  It's voters like these we need to talk with - those who are dispirited and confused like Steve; ambivalent...</description>

      <title>'Wildly offensive'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/862179/diors-new-ad-campaign-sauvage-wildly-offensive</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's bad and then there's gasp-out-loud, cringe-so-hard, ask-rhetorically-how-on-Earth-anyone-thought-this-was-a-good-idea bad. A new Dior campaign for its men's fragrance Sauvage is, well, the latter. Touted as being "an authentic journey deep into the Native American soul in a sacred, founding, and secular territory" â€” which, what â€” the online ad campaign prominently features a Native American spirit dancer. Again, this perfume is called Sauvage. An authentic journey deep into the Native American soul in a sacred, founding and secular territory. More to come. September 1st.Learn more https://t.co/XW1ZveuOjA#diorsauvage #diorparfums pic.twitter.com/TT4N9Z0Iaz â€” Dior (@Dior) August 30, 2019 Dior also released an extended version of the campaign earlier this month. In that video, the spirit dancer also appears, as does Johnny Depp, who is serving as the face of the campaign. A woman wearing a wolf skin (???) peeks through some bushes while Depp plays his guitar on the top of the canyon. "We are the land," he says at the end. Yikes!  The bad judgment somehow doesn't end there. The ad copy also uses outdated, offensive language, claiming that the perfume "[melds] extreme freshness with warm oriental tones." On Instagram, perhaps anticipating trouble, Dior wrote that its video was made in "close collaboration [with] Native American consultants from the 50-year old Indigenous advocacy organization" Americans for Indian Opportunity. Still, the fashion industry has a long history of inappropriate and offensive cultural appropriations, a trend that even the famed French fashion house hasn't managed to avoid. Last year, Dior was slammed for an ad campaign that pulled heavily from Mexican culture but featured, inexplicably, Jennifer Lawrence as its model. In 2011, former Dior head designer John Galliano was caught on video saying "I love Hitler" and making racist comments to diners in a Paris cafÃ©. Jeva Lange</description>

The cause of death is listed as a mixture of “alcohol, fentanyl and oxycodone intoxication with terminal aspiration of gastric contents,” meaning Skaggs, 27, essentially choked on his vomit while under the influence. The death, according to the report, was ruled an accident. He was found on his bed, fully clothed, and there were no signs of trauma.</description>
