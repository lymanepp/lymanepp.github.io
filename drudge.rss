      <title>Biden limiting exposure to play down 'older' age impressions?</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Biden-s-campaign-is-one-of-limited-exposure-13898011.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., plans to enjoy ice cream with New Hampshire voters to celebrate Memorial Day. He won't be far from former Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., another presidential candidate, who's in the midst of his 19th trip to the state and plans an itinerary that includes four barbecues, one parade and a wreath-laying.  In Iowa, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is rolling through the cornfields in an RV, while Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., unveils a "Family Bill of Rights" and tours an ethanol plant.  And here's former Vice President Joe Biden's agenda for the holiday weekend, according to his campaign: "Joe Biden has no public events scheduled."  Those seven words are becoming familiar for the Biden team. Aside from a campaign swing right after announcing his candidacy, Biden has kept his head down while his rivals rush from state to state to state. Even when he has held public events, they have included only a handful of questions from voters or reporters.  The light public schedule reflects the unique position of his campaign, advisers say: With near universal name recognition and high favorability ratings among Democrats, the former vice president does not need to introduce himself to voters like nearly every other candidate. And as the leader in early polls, he can attract media attention without splashy events.  But there are risks. Voters in the early primary states - especially Iowa, with its caucus system that rewards on-the-ground organizing - want to see the candidates personally and often. And there is the danger that Biden's schedule could reinforce a word President Donald Trump is already using to describe his candidacy: sleepy.  Biden's campaign says that's not going to happen. "I have zero worry that any voter will leave a Joe Biden event with doubts about his energy," said Kate Bedingfield, his deputy...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;kdvr.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SILVERTON — Not only did Southwest Colorado experience healthy snowpack levels this season, but it also dealt with unprecedented avalanche activity. According to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, about 230 slides plummeted into the area since November 1, 2018. "Some things ran this year that hadn’t run in 50 years and some things didn’t run this year that normally run every year. So it’s crazy!” said Joe Jepsen, who lives just north of Silverton.</description>
