      <title>Dem presidential campaign has produced confusion rather than clarity...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/The-Democratic-presidential-campaign-has-produced-14872449.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Democratic presidential candidates have been on the campaign trail for nearly a year. Confusion rather than clarity continues to be the story of their contest for the 2020 nomination.  Early in the year, the party's liberal wing seemed to be ascendant, defined by the candidacies of Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and the embrace of a single-payer, Medicare-for-all health-care program. Sanders and Warren were calling for other dramatic changes to the system - economic and political - and their voices stood out. Some other candidates offered echoes of their ideas.  That proved to be a misleading indicator of where the Democratic electorate was on some of the issues, particularly health care, in part because there were fewer moderate voices being heard. Former Vice President Joe Biden didn't join the race until April. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg wasn't being taken very seriously. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., wasn't breaking through.  The candidate debates provided the setting for the arguments to play out before a larger audience. Warren and Sanders came under attack from moderate Democrats at the first debate in June in Miami, with former Maryland congressman John Delaney the most vocal. But Warren and Sanders more than held their own. It appeared as though the progressive wing was on solid ground.  Subsequent debates, however, have produced a different impression. The progressives have been much more on the defensive and the moderates more assertive. Biden tangled with Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in the Detroit debate over the issue of health care. Harris subsequently modified her position, moving toward the center. On the issue of Medicare-for-all, the ground has shifted.  During the Atlanta debate in late November, even Sanders seemed to be tempering his overall message....</description>

      <title>In bitter British election, influence of wealthy U.S. donors causes stir...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/In-a-bitter-British-election-influence-of-14872390.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Britain's Dec. 12 election is a bitter fight to shape the country's future, with voters not only hoping to chart the next steps of Brexit, but also picking between startlingly different visions of the country from right-wing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and left-wing Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.  However, it isn't just British voters who are influencing Britain's future. A number of wealthy American individuals and organizations appear also to be having a big influence on this fraught British election.  The prominent left-leaning newspaper the Guardian reported Friday that 11 wealthy American donors have given a total of more than $3.7 million to influential right-wing British groups over the past five years.  One conservative American billionaire who was having an outsize influence on right-wing groups across the pond is no longer alive. John Templeton, who died in 2008, was behind a set of foundations that gave $3.3 million to British groups, the newspaper reported.  The news comes as Washington focuses on allegations of foreign influence on U.S. elections and is a reminder that outside the United States, the problem is often seen through the opposite lens: wealthy Americans seeking to influence foreign elections.  The U.S. donations in Britain do not appear to be illegal, and some of the think tanks involved have pushed back against the Guardian's framing. One recipient of Templeton-linked money, the Legatum Institute, told the paper that it had "a strong policy of maintaining intellectual independence" despite foreign financial backing.  In a statement in response to the article, the John Templeton Foundation, one of the organizations linked to the late investor, said that it was "proud to support academic research and civil dialogue in the natural sciences, human sciences, philosophy, classical liberalism, and...</description>

      <title>Ice preserved tiny puppy in near-perfect condition for 18,000 years. Scientists fascinated...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ice-preserved-a-tiny-puppy-in-near-perfect-14871919.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers have big outstanding questions about the puppy they have named Dogor - "friend" in a language of the Siberian area where the creature spent 18,000 years in permafrost.  They're still trying to figure out if the tiny animal is a dog or wolf. They wonder whether he could be part of the evolutionary bridge that turned a fierce wild animal into man's best friend.  They don't have to speculate about what Dogor looked like, however, because icy conditions have left him remarkably frozen in time. Scientists can touch his fur, lift his padded paws and pull back his lips to bare small, yellowed teeth.  "Fantastic, right?" says Dave Stanton, a research fellow at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm who has been scrutinizing the long-lost canine. "We have quite a lot of ancient samples. . . . But this has got be one of the best-preserved."  The puppy was discovered last year by locals in Yakutia, said Sergey Fedorov, who heads the exposition hall at the Mammoth Museum of Russia's North-Eastern Federal University. Dogor left the wilderness as a lump of soil and ice, but scientists could make out the head and paws of what they believed at first to be a young wolf.  Federov told The Washington Post that he carefully cleaned off dirt and debris to reveal near-intact fur - "extremely rare for animals of that time period."  "It's an amazing feeling, to see, touch and feel the history of earth," he said.  The puppy, whose name was announced earlier this week, remains in Russia. But he has caught the attention of researchers in Sweden and England who want to better understand Dogor's life and place in a still-mysterious evolution.  Testing on a rib bone has revealed the animal's age: about two months, said Stanton, a postdoctoral scholar who's been working for over a year on...</description>

      <title>Facing impeachment inquiry, Trump strives to look hard at work...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Facing-impeachment-inquiry-Trump-strives-to-look-14872290.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PALM BEACH, Fla. - As Democrats in Congress push to impeach him, President Donald Trump has toured a manufacturing plant in Texas, boasted about economic gains and signed numerous bills. He served turkey to U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving and grieved with the families of fallen service members at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.  And next week, Trump is scheduled to jet to London to meet with European allies and be received at Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II.  Sure, Trump has been consumed by the impeachment proceedings, popping off daily, if not hourly, about what he dubs a "hoax." But he and his aides also have staged photo opportunities and public events designed to showcase the president on the job - a strategy one year out from the election to convince the American people that he is hard at work for them at the same time that Democrats are trying to remove him from office.  "I'm working my ass off," Trump told a thunderous rally crowd of roughly 20,000 on Tuesday night in Sunrise, Florida. He added: "The failed Washington establishment is trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you and because we're winning. It's very simple."  Trump is taking a page out of the Clinton playbook. Then-President Bill Clinton survived his 1998 impeachment in part because the economy was roaring and because he appeared to many voters to be relentlessly focused on doing the business of the American people. When Clinton left office in 2001, Gallup measured his job approval rating at 66%.  Clinton had a built-in advantage that Trump does not enjoy: popularity. Throughout his second term, Clinton's approval rating hovered in the high 50s and 60s, whereas Trump's has been mired below 50%.  Still, Clinton's experience has been instructive to Trump, who recently met in the Oval Office with former Clinton strategist Mark...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Swinging cranes and clawing excavators have reshaped the landscape here, elevating Charlotte's skyline, expanding its girth and transforming this former cotton-shipment town into the South's financial hub and one of America's fastest-growing cities.  But the Queen City also has been steadily unbuilding itself, bulldozing houses and razing apartment complexes along its creeks, ripping up a mall parking lot to reveal a hidden waterway and then stripping away its concrete banks, all in a bid to prevent the flash flooding that turns communities into deathtraps.  The county has removed 460 structures and replaced them with absorbent grasslands, winning national praise as a prototype for regional flood planning that anticipates the impact of projected development and the growing effects of extreme weather. The innovative strategy was ahead of the curve when it launched in the 1990s, by calculating future flood risk and then purchasing - and demolishing - vulnerable homes, businesses and office buildings.  But the region is facing more-complex challenges as climate change threatens bigger and more-lasting deluges. Six out of North Carolina's seven wettest storms have occurred in the past 20 years. In June, following an 11-inch downpour upstream, the Catawba River burst its banks here in a catastrophe that can't be cured by opening up a few extra acres of flood plain.  "We just can't engineer ourselves out of this problem," said Bill Hunt, a civil engineer at North Carolina State University who predicts that more-drastic steps will become necessary to move entire communities out of danger.  "What Charlotte has done works very well for two- or three-inch rains," Hunt said. "But we don't have tools to fix 11- or 12-inch rains."  The program, operated jointly by the city of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, has...</description>

      <title>Netanyahu clings to office while calling criminal charges against him a 'witch hunt'... </title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Netanyahu-clings-to-office-while-calling-criminal-14871331.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This appears in Saturday's Washington Post:  - - -  When former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert came under criminal investigation on bribery charges a decade ago, he took the honorable route and resigned, opening the way for new elections that brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power. Now it's Netanyahu's turn: Israel's attorney general announced Nov. 21 that he plans to indict the sitting prime minister on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. To the detriment of Israel and its democracy, Netanyahu is taking the low road.  Rather than accede to the many calls for him to resign - and a poll showing that a majority of Israelis want him to go - Netanyahu has adopted what might be called, and what probably deliberately is, a Trumpian defense. The charges against him, he claims, are an "attempted coup"; the police investigators and prosecutors who spent years preparing them are guilty of a "witch hunt" and should themselves be investigated.  On Tuesday, Netanyahu staged a public rally in Tel Aviv and bused in supporters to demonstrate against the "coup." The result was a welcome sign that he may have gone too far: Key leaders of his Likud party declined to attend. One of them, Gideon Saar, has said he will challenge Netanyahu for the party leadership in a primary.  Netanyahu's intransigence is particularly worrying because it is the primary reason Israeli politicians have been unable to form a government following elections in April and again in September. Neither the Likud's right-wing alliance nor its center-left opposition commands a majority in the Knesset. The centrist Blue and White party, which holds the most seats, says it will not form an alliance with Likud unless Netanyahu agrees to give up the prime minister's post, at least while his criminal case plays out.  Netanyahu appears to hope that remaining in...</description>

      <title>Pardons likely for Flynn, Manafort, Stone...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/It-s-a-good-bet-Trump-will-pardon-his-felon-14871149.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The future isn't promised, but it is a good bet that three felons and close allies of President Donald Trump - Roger Stone (found guilty of obstruction of a congressional investigation, witness tampering and lying to Congress), Paul Manafort (serving prison sentence for tax evasion and bank fraud) and Michael Flynn (pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI) - will be granted executive clemency. The only question is when.  It might be a tad bit premature for Manafort to start humming "I'll Be Home for Christmas." But he will be there next year.  To be sure, Trump could free his friends before voters cast their ballots in 2020. But that's politically risky, as President Gerald Ford's 1976 defeat can attest. His approval rating dropped more than 30 points after he pardoned Richard Nixon.  Trump's safest course of action would be to wait to do the dirty deed until after Election Day, Nov. 3, 2020. Trump's impulsiveness, however, is a wild card.  Impeached or not, Trump can still grant pardons without fear of a citizens' revolt - once the polls close. Even if the voters serve him with an eviction, Trump can still cut his boys loose, provided he acts before turning off the lights in the Oval Office.  The Stone, Manafort and Flynn prediction is offered with confidence because of Trump's demonstrated disregard for the integrity of the criminal-justice system.  That disdain was on display in his recent chiseling of the military judicial process. Against the advice of experienced, respected leaders in the Pentagon, Trump intervened in three cases involving war crimes accusations, overturning decisions of military juries and issuing full pardons to two soldiers convicted of war crimes, as well as reversing disciplinary action against a third service member, Chief Petty Officer Edward...</description>
