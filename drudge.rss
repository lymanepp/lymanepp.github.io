      <title>Can Biden be both future and past?</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Can-Joe-Biden-be-both-the-future-and-the-past-13915734.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Vice President Joe Biden is off to a good start in his third bid for the White House. His opening weeks have set him apart from his Democratic rivals. For the time being, he is operating on his own timetable, at his own pace and rhythm. So far there have been no major negative effects to that strategy.  But there is a question at the heart of his candidacy, in part created by the focus of his campaign message. It involves intangibles that shape almost every presidential campaign. For Biden, it comes to this: Can he be both past and future? Can he be the custodian of a pre-President Donald Trump status quo and a candidate offering real change?  Two weeks ago, he held a rally in downtown Philadelphia. His speech was a compendium of personal reflections, political messaging and policy ambitions. His overall theme was unity and the need to bring the country together, across the partisan divide. One line, however, seemed to capture how he wants people to see the coming campaign and his place in it.  He was talking about the need for action on climate change. He had drawn some fire from climate activists for a comment attributed in a Reuters report to a Biden adviser, who indicated that he would seek a "middle ground" position on climate. To some it sounded like a lowering of ambitions, a retreat from big and bold action that many in the party favor.  Biden sought to reassure people that he views the changing climate as an existential threat to the planet, something he would take seriously and deal with aggressively. He also told his audience that the "first and most important plank" of a Biden climate policy could be summed up in two words: "Beat Trump."  His argument was hardly specious. He pointed to all the things that he - and the 22 other Democrats seeking the party's nomination - are talking about, all they would...</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Trump-s-reliance-on-pressure-tactics-is-showing-13915541.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump's brinkmanship with Mexico over immigration has opened a new and risky front in his global campaign to pressure other nations to capitulate to his demands, a strategy that has paid few dividends over 21/2 years and left his major foreign policy initiatives in doubt.  From his "fire and fury" rhetoric against a nuclear-armed North Korea to an escalating trade war with China to new ultimatums aimed at Mexico, Trump has wielded threats, insults and punishments against his foreign counterparts with diminishing returns.  Though he lured Kim Jong Un to the negotiating table through a "maximum pressure" campaign of economic sanctions, Trump's historic summits with the young dictator ended in failure after talks collapsed in February.  Beijing attempted to negotiate over Trump's push for a trade deal, but President Xi Jinping has met successive rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods with commensurate retaliatory measures, deepening an increasingly zero-sum clash between the world's two largest economies.  And although Mexico took steps to comply with Trump's hard-line immigration policies - allowing Central American asylum seekers to the United States a temporary haven - Trump's vow this week to impose sweeping tariffs unless that nation curbs unauthorized immigration into the United States stirred a public backlash.  For Trump, who campaigned on achieving "peace through strength," the consistent application of a tool kit of toughness has limited his options and left him in a precarious position as he accelerates his campaign for a second term.  Despite his pressure tactics, unauthorized immigration at the U.S.-Mexican border is at a 12-year peak, the tariff wars have sent jitters through Wall Street, and Pyongyang has resumed testing of short-range...</description>

      <title>New credit bubble ready to burst?</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/A-new-credit-bubble-gets-ready-to-burst-13911193.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a speech a couple of weeks back that showed that financial regulators have learned many lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, but not the most important one, namely:  If regulators wait to act until they can say with certainty that a credit bubble is about to burst, they've waited too long.  That's particularly true when it comes to the opaque and unregulated "shadow" banking system on Wall Street that has now supplanted regulated banks as the leading source of credit for businesses and consumers. This shadow system gets its money from big investors rather than depositors, and it revolves around hedge funds, investment banks and private equity funds rather than banks. These shadow banks have made borrowed money cheaper and easier to get, but they have also made the financial system and the U.S. economy more susceptible to booms and busts. And with another giant credit bubble ready to burst - this one having to do with business borrowing - we're about to learn that painful lesson again.  The rise of the shadow banking system began in the 1980s with "junk" bonds, which for the first time allowed companies with less than blue-chip credit ratings to borrow more easily and cheaply from investors in the bond market than from banks on which they had always relied.  Then, beginning in the 1990s, shadow banks moved aggressively into home mortgages and other consumer debt - auto loans, student loans, credit card debt - which they bought from banks and other lenders, packaged together and sold to investors as bond-like securities. You know how that turned out.  After the crash in 2008, shadow bankers shifted their attention to business lending, using the same "securitization" process to buy and package "leveraged" loans - bank loans to big companies that were already highly indebted - into...</description>
