Now the layoffs have started coming in droves. Last month, robot pizza startup Zume and car-sharing company Getaround slashed more than 500 jobs. Then DNA testing company 23andMe, logistics startup Flexport, Firefox maker Mozilla and question-and-answer website Quora did their own cuts.  "It feels like a reckoning is here," said Josh Wolfe, a venture capitalist at Lux Capital in New York.  It's a humbling shift for an industry that long saw itself as an engine of job creation and innovation, producing ride-hailing giant Uber, hospitality company Airbnb and other now well-known brands that often disrupted entrenched industries.  Their rise was propelled by a wave of investor money - about $763 billion washed into startups in the United States over the past decade - that also fueled the growth of young companies in delivery, cannabis, real estate and direct-to-consumer goods. Unlike low-cost software startups, these private companies frequently took on old-line competitors by spending heavily on physical assets and workers while losing money.  Now a pullback is unfolding in precisely the areas that drew the most hype.  Around the world, more than 30 startups have slashed more than 8,000 jobs over the past four months, according to a tally by The New York Times. Investments in young companies have fallen, with 2,215 startups raising money in the United States in the last three months of 2019, the fewest since late 2016, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook, which...</description>

      <title>BUFFETT BOOSTS BLOOMBERG...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/897723/warren-buffett-says-hed-certainly-vote-mike-bloomberg-but-have-what-happens-bernie-sanders</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's Warren Buffett season. The billionaire and CEO and chair of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. sent his annual shareholder letter out this weekend, and appeared Monday on CNBC's Squawk Box, where he weighed in on various topics, including the 2020 presidential election. Buffett normally supports Democratic candidates, but he admitted he's not a 'card-carrying' member of the party and has contributed to and voted for Republicans in the past. There was no indication he'd support President Trump's re-election in the interview, but he did seem hesitant about supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) if he winds up as the Democratic nominee. Buffett didn't denounce Sanders â€” in fact, he said he agrees with him on some counts, especially the argument that 'we ought to do better by the people who get left behind by our capitalist system' â€” but he said he'll wait to see what happens before making any sort of declaration. One Democratic candidate he doesn't seem concerned about voting for is his fellow billionaire, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Buffett said he'd 'certainly' vote for Bloomberg, but his own self-awareness seems likely to prevent him from endorsing him during the primaries. 'I don't think another billionaire supporting him would be the best thing to announce,' he said. 'But sure, I would have no trouble voting for Mike Bloomberg.' Read more at CNBC.
