      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Democrats kicked off their virtual nominating convention Monday with a focused denunciation of President Donald Trump, showcasing dozens of testimonials that culminated in lancing criticism from former first lady Michelle Obama, who cast Trump as incapable of meeting America's needs and said Joe Biden would usher in racial justice and ease the coronavirus pandemic.  In the centerpiece speech of the night, a searing indictment of her husband Barack Obama's successor, Michelle Obama declared that Trump has mishandled the pandemic and failed to respond to outcries over the deaths of Black Americans. She warned that the nation would suffer more if he is elected to a second term.  "Let me be as honest and clear as I possibly can: Donald Trump is the wrong president for our country. He has had more than enough time to prove that he can do the job, but he is clearly in over his head. He cannot meet this moment. He simply cannot be who we need him to be for us," she said, before quoting a line Trump used about covid-19 deaths in a recent interview: "It is what it is."  Obama spoke passionately about protests against police brutality this year - and Trump's declaration that those in the streets were anarchists.  "Here at home as George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and a never-ending list of innocent people of color continue to be murdered, stating the simple fact that a Black life matters is still met with derision from the nation's highest office," Obama said, wearing a necklace that read "Vote."  Earlier in the night, the brother of Floyd, who was killed while pleading for air as a Minneapolis police officer knelt on him, appeared to ask for a moment of silence to commemorate those who have died as a result of police misconduct.  "It is up to us to carry on the fight for justice," Philonise Floyd said, without making an overt call for...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump at a campaign-style event in Oshkosh, Wisconsin on Monday: "So, we have to win the election. We can't play games. Get out and vote. Do those beautiful absentee ballots or just make sure your vote gets counted. Make sure, because the only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged. Remember that. It's the only way we're going to lose this election... This is more than this election. That's a big statement. The only way they're going to win is that way, and we can't let that happen. And, you know, our post office, we're going to make our post office great. It's been a disaster for many years. We're going to take care of the men and women in the post office, and we're going to make it great. Right now, it's a laughingstock."</description>

Sanders says that "by rejecting science," President Trump has "put our lives and health in jeopardy" and "fanned this pandemic." "Ideas that were once considered radical only a few years ago are now considered mainstream," Sanders said.  "My friends, the price of failure us just too great to imagine," Sanders said about the Biden/Harris ticket.</description>

      <title>Subtle handoff for 78-year-old senator...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/We-have-a-come-a-very-long-way-Bernie-Sanders-15490156.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Few people saw the beginning of Sen. Bernie Sanders's journey in presidential politics as a major moment - including Sanders himself.  "Let me just make a brief comment," the Vermont independent said as he spoke to a small group of reporters outside the Capitol in April 2015. "We don't have an endless amount of time."  Since then, everything and nothing has changed.  "We have come a very long way in five years," Sanders said in an interview Sunday, chuckling as he recalled his modest start, which focused on the power of the "billionaire class."  Sanders's address at the Democratic National Convention on Monday night effectively closed an improbable odyssey - two bids for the White House that together formed the backbone of a new, insurgent liberal movement.  Sanders nodded to his success in lifting his previously fringe calls for Medicare-for-all, free college tuition and a chastening of the nation's financial elite to the fore of a Democratic Party that had been drifting toward more-centrist views.  "Many of the ideas we fought for, that just a few years ago were considered radical, are now mainstream," Sanders said in his address, speaking from Burlington, Vt.  He cast President Donald Trump as a historic failure - a "threat to our democracy" who is "leading us down the path of authoritarianism."  "Nero fiddled while Rome burned," Sanders said. "Trump golfs. His actions fanned this pandemic, resulting in over 170,000 deaths and a nation still unprepared to protect its people."  Any bitterness about his defeat in the primary to presumptive nominee Joe Biden was absent. This phase of his revolution was televised and unified, with Sanders urging his supporters to back Biden.  "My friends, I say to you, to everyone who supported other candidates in the primary and to those who...</description>

      <title>Trump says coronavirus is 'God testing me'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/931752/trump-says-coronavirus-god-testing-build-economy-again</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Trump on Monday blasted his likely presidential challenger former Vice President Joe Biden during a speech in Manakato, Minnesota, saying he'd 'abolish the American way of life' en route to turning the U.S. into a 'very boring socialist country that will go to hell.' He then had a go at Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), for co-sponsoring a 'socialist takeover of health care.' The president also joked the coronavirus pandemic was 'God testing me' to rebuild the U.S. economy a second time. He zeroed in on New Zealand, a country which, to Trump's apparent chagrin, has won praise for containing the virus. Recently, though, New Zealand has had a flare-up, and Trump made sure the crowd in Minnesota knew about it. While New Zealanders are certainly concerned about the virus resurfacing after several months, just nine new infections were reported Monday, far lower than the average daily number of cases in the United States, which Trump maintains has handled the pandemic with aplomb. 'All of a sudden a lot of the places they were using to hold up, they are having a big surge ... New Zealand, you see what's going on in New Zealand' -- New Zealand had nine (9!) new Covid cases today. The US had more than 42,000. The outbreaks are not comparable. pic.twitter.com/T8ugmKK6aa â€” Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) August 17, 2020 The speech also included a defense of the Minneapolis Police Department, which has come under fire in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, and criticism of the Minneapolis protests. 'The city was ablaze,' he lamented. Tim O'Donnell Trump says this of Minneapolis cops: 'The police department is very good but they were told you can't do anything. They have to be able to do what they do very well.' (Recall that people were protesting in Mpls after George Floyd was killed by a cop.) pic.twitter.com/nQJZp9P3a0 â€” Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) August 17, 2020</description>
