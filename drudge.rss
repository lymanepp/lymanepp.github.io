      <title>Roubini Warns Yields Above 2% Will Bite Amid Excess Risk...</title>
      <link>https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roubini-warns-higher-u-yields-073514681.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;finance.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Bloomberg) -- A fresh spike in Treasury yields will rattle markets and could send more family offices and hedge funds down a similar path to Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management, according to Nouriel Roubini.Roubini, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business and a former adviser to the U.S. government, said the combination of low-to-negative rates across advanced economies and fiscal stimulus is leading investors to take excessive risk. He pointed to cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratios at highs seen in 1929 and the early 2000s as one sign of the recklessness.“We’re seeing widespread frothiness, bubbles, risk-taking and leverage,” Roubini said on Bloomberg TV. “Lots of players have taken too much leverage and too much risk and some of them are going to blow up.”Read More: Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation MetricsMeltdown WarningsThe professor, who earned the nickname “Dr. Doom” for his ominous prognostications about the economy and financial system, joins investors including Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Investments in warning that more Archegos-style meltdowns could be triggered. Roubini said one shock could come if 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climb higher than 2% this year.Bank of America Corp. strategists cited the same level as among the biggest risks to the bull run in equities, following record inflows of $372 billion in the first quarter. A burst of strong economic data may fuel such a move in yields as money managers price in an improving growth outlook. The thinking is that before raising rates, the Federal Reserve will begin to ponder trimming its bond purchases, a move that’s been a catalyst for higher real rates in the past.Read More: U.S. Yields’ Trek Higher Seen Getting Fuel From Real Rates Christian Mueller-Glissmann, a London-based strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said there’s a “very good chance” that the 10-year U.S. yield overshoots in the second quarter beyond the firm’s year-end forecast of 1.9%.“You’re dealing with peak growth momentum and we’re dealing with incredible pressure from a fund flow point of view as well, where you haven’t really seen major outflows out of bonds,” he said on Bloomberg TV.‘Hot War’Investors must also grapple with other risks, including the return of inflation and the prospect of a “hot war” between the U.S. and China, Roubini said.While a stronger dollar has led some hedge funds and other investors to capitulate on their bearish bets, the greenback will weaken over the medium term as twin deficits in the world’s largest economy widen, he said. Meantime, U.S. sanctions may lead countries like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea to diversify away from dollar assets.“Even if in the short-term growth outcomes in the U.S. strengthen the dollar, the direction of the dollar is south over time,” Roubini said.(Adds equity inflows data in fifth paragraph and Goldman comments beginning in sixth.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.</description>

      <title>World's Worst COVID Death Rate Sends Czechs Back Into Cold War Misery...</title>
      <link>https://news.yahoo.com/world-worst-covid-death-rate-081311848.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;news.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;GettyLITOMĚŘICE, Czech Republic—A blue light flashing across bedroom windows has become a feature of the nights. This is Litoměřice, a town in the north of the Czech Republic. The light is from yet another ambulance climbing the access road that leads from the dark, deserted town to a hospital perched on a hill. On board, there is likely to be another COVID-19 patient. This is the country with the highest COVID death rate on Earth, and it’s experiencing another surge of infections.Kateřina Steinbachová, a doctor, lives next door to the Litoměřice hospital in a medical residence. A year ago, this hospital was selected to be one of the special COVID units for the northern part of the country. Ironically, the ambulance traffic is the only sign of life during these desperate nights of the pandemic.“My parents told me that the outside world looks like evenings during the communist dictatorship,” the 31-year-old doctor says.Back in the communist era, businesses would close early, there were no neon signs blinking into the night and people would rather keep to themselves at home than wander around. Boredom, anxiety and feelings of abandonment suffocated towns back then. This past year, the string of restrictions, bans, curfews and lockdowns has brought back these unhappy memories for many Czechs.“Many of my older patients have fallen into a depression, saying the surroundings now remind them of the times of the ‘Communist normalization.’ They feel like they’re being swallowed by grayness,” says psychotherapist Tomáš Rektor.He’s referring to the 1970s following the so-called Prague Spring when the Soviet tanks sent from Moscow brutally crushed the Czechoslovakian rebellion against Communist rule. The bloodshed put the Communist hardliners back in charge. They subsequently governed the country with a mixture of bureaucratic overreach and violent repression.Apart from the similarity in how things look, it is the Communist social legacy that has come into sharp relief these days. The mindset of many Czechs was formed during the dictatorship, which ended in 1989 after 42 years, when the current generation of Czech people over 50 were in the prime of their lives. This has significantly contributed to the current health crisis, analysts say.The Czech Republic’s COVID-related death rate per 100,000 remains the highest in the European Union, and so is the daily number of infected people. Dozens of hospitals are on verge of collapse, many unable to receive gravely ill patients for the lack of ICU beds and medical personnel.Dozens of hospitals in the Czech Republic have declared a “mass casualty event,” meaning that ICU beds might not be available for patients who need them. It’s gotten so critical that the Czech government has asked Germany, Switzerland and Poland to take in dozens of patients to help these overwhelmed hospitals.The current crisis here is particularly mind-blowing because the Czech Republic successfully smashed the virus during the first wave in the spring of 2020. Czechs watched in horror as Italy, their favorite vacation destination, was ravaged by the coronavirus. While hundreds of Italians were dying each day, in the Czech Republic the daily death toll in the first three months of pandemic never surpassed 10. There were even days when no one died.The COVID-19 pandemic has served as a big test for this young democracy and many believe that after the initial triumph against the virus, Czechs failed big-time. There is still a sense that people expect the government to solve their problems rather that taking personal responsibility. “Since the fall of communism, we have yet to learn how to live in freedom. We have not developed a sense of self responsibility. We prefer to delegate it onto somebody else. In this case onto the government,” said sociologist Jiřina Šiklová, who was a close ally of late President Václav Havel. She came from the same dissident circle as Havel, and she was good friends with the first freely elected head of the state after the totalitarian regime had ended.In times of crisis like the COVID pandemic, this buck-passing attitude is unlikely to serve you well if the government turns out to be incompetent. And the Czech government, under the leadership of the current, controversial prime minister, Andrej Babiš, has a long record of failed decisions and botched strategies in dealing with the COVID threat.Babiš, a former member of the Communist secret service police, acknowledged some blunders in a recent speech. Specifically, he said it was a bad decision to allow businesses to reopen for the Christmas season and that the summer relaxation of the masks wearing mandate was wrong. He also admitted that his government underestimated the British variant of the virus.The local hospital in Litoměřicre is on the receiving end of these missteps and errors. It has been overflowing with COVID patients who got infected with the dangerous British mutation.“My colleagues at the COVID units are exhausted. They have been in it for a year and, in the last few months, have had to endure war-like situations,” says Dr. Steinbachová.Many hospitals are so short of staff that they desperately keep asking for voluntary workers with little or no experience. Some even employ soldiers and firefighters. On top of these extreme circumstances, many doctors and nurses have been infected and, according to the government figures, are among the hardest hit professionals in terms of COVID contagion.And it is far from over. At the end of February this year, Prime Minister Babiš said that the month of March would be hellish. The statistics proved him right. The rate of hospitalization, the number of gravely ill and currently infected are at record levels. And this country of 10.7 million is rapidly approaching 27,000 COVID-19 related deaths. Globally, the Czech Republic sits in first place when it comes to deaths per 100,000.Pavel Žáček, a former director of the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, said the Czech population was being forced into a period of self-examination as the required pandemic response offered echoes of their autocratic past.Developed democracies at the beginning of the pandemic could not blunt the spread of the virus because their people were not used to being told what to do and many defied restrictions, said Žáček. The autocratic regimes were more successful at enforcing rules but took advantage of the situation to go after dissenters.“The Czech Republic falls somewhere in between those two systems,” he notes, saying that on one hand many deeply distrust Babiš’s government’s handling of the pandemic, while on the other there are still large swaths of the population who demand more intervention.Žáček fears people are forgetting what they’ve learnt since the end of the Cold War.“I am worried that in the post-COVID era, a good enough number of Czechs will want the government to keep helping them,” said Žáček, “and the country will shift towards socialism again.”Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

      <title>NETFLIX Loses 31% of Market Share in Year as Rivals Gain Ground...</title>
      <link>https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/netflix-lost-31-market-share-130058085.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.yahoo.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a year in which streaming became even more important to millions of Americans, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, Netflix still dominates the streaming universe in the U.S. But new data shared by Ampere Analysis with TheWrap shows that while Netflix holds 20% of the U.S. streaming market, its dominance over the rest of the streaming landscape has shrunk from 29% — a drop of nearly one third– as more services enter the market. Here’s a snapshot of the top streaming services in the U.S. and how their market share stacks up compared to the same time last year: Also Read: Inside Hollywood's Rush to Cash in on NFTs A few points worth mentioning: • Netflix’s U.S. market share has taken a hit in the last year — even as it added a company-record 36.58 million new accounts globally in 2020. Netflix’s U.S. market share has been sliced from 29% to 20% since the start of 2020; that’s a 31% drop in the last year. • In January, Netflix reported that it had 73.94 million subscribers in both the U.S. and Canada (Netflix always reports the two markets together); an estimated 7 million of those subscribers come from north of the border, meaning Netflix has about 67 million active subscriptions in the U.S. alone. • Netflix’s slice of the overall streaming pie in the U.S. has gotten smaller as new services like HBO Max and NBCUniversal’s Peacock emerged in 2020. • The same can be said for Amazon Prime Video. A year ago, Amazon Prime Video claimed 21% of the U.S. streaming market, but that’s now down to 16% — a drop of nearly 24%. • Amazon Prime Video is a bit trickier for streaming analysts to project. For one thing, anyone who pays for an Amazon Prime subscription gets access to Prime Video, but that doesn’t necessarily mean every Prime subscriber is watching “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” or “Jack Ryan.” (Some may sign up for free shipping on goods.) Amazon hasn’t given an update on its total Prime memberships since early 2020, when it announced it had passed 150 million paying customers; Ampere’s data indicates nearly 54 million of Prime members use their Prime Video app in the U.S. • Disney-owned Hulu takes the bronze medal here, but that includes both its Hulu streaming service and its live TV streaming service. • This may be the most surprising aspect of Ampere’s data: Disney+ is sitting in fifth place in the U.S. streaming field, and even finds itself narrowly behind HBO despite the uneven rollout of HBO Max last year. While Disney+ reported 94 million subscribers by the end of 2020, the service has a strong presence outside the U.S., and as The Information recently reported, a hair less than 40 million of its subscribers are American. • HBO’s numbers are impressive. In January, parent company AT&amp;T boasted that HBO Max had topped 41 million American subscribers, edging past Disney+ domestically — but that tally includes some chicanery: About 17.2 million of those subscribers are “activated,” as AT&amp;T put it, meaning they’ve downloaded the HBO Max app. (Remember, HBO already had existing streaming customers across both its HBO Go and HBO Now services prior to HBO Max.) • The biggest gainers, in terms of market share, were Peacock, which went from 0% of the market to 5% of the market by the end of 2020, and HBO, which only claimed 3% of the streaming pie at the same time last year; that slice has now quadrupled in size, as HBO has looked to propel its linchpin service, HBO Max, into the upper echelon of streaming services. Most notably, in an effort to win over new subscribers, Warner Bros. decided to release all 17 of its 2021 films — including “Godzilla vs. Kong” and Keanu Reeves’ “Matrix 4” — on HBO Max at the same time they hit theaters this year. For another angle, here’s how the current streaming hierarchy shakes out in the U.S., a few weeks before Netflix and other streamers are set to report their Q1 subscriber gains (or losses): Also Read: Inside FuboTV's Push Into Sports Betting and Pandemic Streaming Trends The battle for third place in the U.S. streaming hierarchy looks to be the key battleground in 2021. Ampere Research Manager Toby Holleran said he expects HBO Max to enjoy “a fair bit of success this year” and credited Warner Bros.’ plan to release all of its theatrical releases on the service the same they hit theaters. However, he predicted, that one-year gambit “will not quite catch up with Hulu.” On top of that, Holleran said he expects “Disney+ to overtake both HBO Max and Hulu” within the first half of 2021, and “finish the year as the third largest streaming service in the U.S., with Hulu taking the fourth spot, and HBO Max taking fifth.” Other streaming competitors — including Apple TV+, NBCUniversal’s Peacock and ViacomCBS’ Paramount+ (here listed by its pre-rebrand name, CBS All Access) — trail far behind the leaders in the category. “Bridgerton” (Netflix) Ampere’s data comes as the average American household is now spending $40 per month on streaming services, as TheWrap reported earlier this year. That’s up 17% from the $34 Americans were spending each month in early 2020, and up 33% from Q1 2019, when Americans were spending $30 per month on average. That’s also likely to push higher in 2021, as services like Disney+ bump up their monthly fees. Holleran added Netflix’s place atop the streaming hierarchy is “seemingly cemented,” even with its slice of the American pie shrinking in the last year, at least for the near future. But despite its first-mover advantage and array of big-name original shows, from “Stranger Things” to “Bridgerton,” Netflix’s no.1 status isn’t guaranteed forever. For one thing, Holleran noted that Disney’s overall streaming business, including both Hulu and ESPN+, surpassed Netflix’s U.S. subscriber base more than a year ago, “and is on track to overtake it worldwide by 2024.” In other words: Don’t be shocked if Disney+ continues to narrow the gap with Netflix, both in the States and abroad.
