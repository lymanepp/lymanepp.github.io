      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/People-moved-here-to-escape-big-city-drama-With-15147904.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WILLCOX, Ariz. - Several employees wore medical masks and almost all wore plastic gloves, a jarring sight for some customers who appeared visibly taken aback as they entered their local Safeway store.  Even in this small town of roughly 3,500 people, the scene wasn't much different than stores in the big city: aisle after aisle of empty shelves where the toilet paper, hand soap and sanitizer used to be. All the Tylenol was sold out, along with cans of beans, cartons of eggs and all the milk - the nondairy kind, too.  And good luck finding a thermometer. Amid the growing concern over the coronavirus, the stock had been cleaned well over a week ago. At first, the pharmacist sent folks over to the Dollar General, but then she'd heard they were out, too.  "I tried to order them, but they're just gone," she said, apologetically.  Up and down the aisles, people shook their heads at the strange scene in a community distant enough to be spared the drama of places like Tucson or Phoenix. This was the place where people came to escape, a small town surrounded by even smaller ones where social distancing was kind of the point.  But all through town, things felt eerie. Restaurants and businesses that were never closed were dark and empty. The dining room at the McDonald's was closed. As shoppers drove into the Safeway parking lot, they passed a panhandler who waved a sign that simply read, "WTF?"  When a Safeway cashier in a medical mask held up the check-out line to wipe down the register area with disinfectant, tensions boiled over. "I mean, this is crazy!" a man said loudly. He ignored fliers posted at the lanes that urged customers to stay at least two shopping carts away from others in the store, inching uncomfortably close to two women ahead of him in line. "This is just too...</description>

      <title>ECONOMY DETERIORATING FAST</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/business/article/U-S-economy-deteriorating-faster-than-15147050.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The U.S. economy is deteriorating more quickly than was expected just days ago, as extraordinary measures designed to curb the coronavirus keep 84 million Americans penned in their homes and cause the near-total shutdown of most businesses.  In a single 24-hour period, the governors of three of the largest states - California, New York and Illinois - ordered residents to stay home, except to buy food and medicine, while the governor of Pennsylvania ordered the closure of nonessential businesses. Across the globe, health officials are struggling to cope with the growing number of patients, with the World Health Organization noting that while it required three months to reach 100,000 cases, it took only 12 days to hit another 100,000.  The resulting economic meltdown, which is sending several million workers streaming into the unemployment line, is outpacing the federal government's efforts to respond. As the Senate on Friday raced to complete work on a financial rescue package, the White House and key lawmakers were dramatically expanding its scope, pushing the legislation far beyond the original $1 trillion price tag.  With each day, an unprecedented stoppage gathers force, as restaurants, movie theaters, sports arenas, and offices close to shield themselves from the disease. Already, it's clear that the initial economic decline will be sharper and more painful than during the 2008 financial crisis.  Next week, roughly 3 million Americans will file first-time claims for unemployment assistance, more than four times the record high set in the depths of the 1982 recession, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That's just the start of a surge that could send the jobless rate spiking to 20 percent from today's 3.5 percent, a JPMorgan Chase economist told clients on a conference call Friday.  Estimates of the...</description>

      <title>Much of life comes to standstill as countries shut themselves off from rest of world... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Much-of-life-comes-to-a-standstill-as-countries-15147058.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;European truck drivers stuck in miles-long backups. Asylum seekers stranded in Mexico. Cities and states within countries - from Rio de Janeiro to Tasmania - sealing themselves off from the rest of their nations.  In a world where the once-steady march of globalization hit strong head winds in recent years from nationalist governments, the novel coronavirus pandemic has done more to suddenly halt and reverse the notion of open - and easily crossed - borders than perhaps any other event in modern history.  The impact to the global economy will be severe. Yet the larger question arising from empty international airports and backed-up land borders may be the long-haul effect of the pandemic on everything from freedom of movement to asylum claims to trade.  "The question is, when the health crisis recedes, be that six months, one year, or two years from now, are we going to see the protectionist measures related to the health crisis recede too?" said Stephanie Segal, a former senior economist at the International Monetary Fund and a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Certainly they will, but will they ever go back to precrisis levels?"  In the meantime, the pandemic is stranding travelers and upending everything from refugee flows to wedding rites.  In South America, still less impacted than other regions, many nations are striving to keep it that way by imposing some of the strictest border controls in the world. Peru and Bolivia have suspended international flights, restricted crossings at land borders, and deployed police and the military on the streets.  As concerns mount about the ability of crisis-plagued Venezuela to control the pandemic, its neighbors have sealed its borders. The closures have raised fears of a bottleneck that could force migrants - as well as...</description>

      <title>Fed begins pumping municipal bonds...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/Federal-Reserve-backstops-muni-bond-market-as-15145736.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Federal Reserve capped off an unprecedented week of action Friday by extending a lifeline to cash-strapped state and local governments that are about to borrow large sums as they deal with skyrocketing costs from coronavirus safety measures.  There has been a large selloff in municipal debt in recent days, driving up the borrowing costs for many states and localities that need to pay their bills.  This is the ninth major action by the Fed this week to try to stabilize financial markets, prevent the downturn from worsening and keep credit flowing to companies and households.  The Fed will make loans available to financial institutions that can be secured by "high quality" state and local bonds. This will make owning these tax-exempt municipal bonds more attractive and should help ensure there is plenty of demand for these bonds as many states and cities begin to issue more debt in the coming weeks and months.  "The Federal Reserve Board on Friday expanded its program of support for the flow of credit to the economy by taking steps to enhance the liquidity and functioning of crucial state and municipal money markets," the Fed said in a statement.  Earlier this week, the central bank slashed interest rates to zero, re-started massive purchases of U.S. Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, began making 0.25% loans to banks and announced backstops for numerous parts of the credit market.  Goldman Sachs predicted Thursday that over 2 million Americans likely lost their jobs this week and many companies could go bankrupt in the next three months if they do not get aid. The Fed's actions are an effort to make as many cheap loans and lines of credit available to households and businesses as possible to make it through the coronavirus recession.</description>

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/903646/goldman-sachs-devastating-revision-gdp-growth-predictions</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goldman Sachs predicts the coronavirus crash will be bigger than it originally thought. In a Friday research note, the bank projected a 24 percent drop in the U.S. GDP in the second quarter â€” a stark revision from its prediction of a five percent drop earlier this week. Goldman Sachs does see a slight rebound in Q3 and Q4 of 12 percent and 10 percent, respectively, but that still leaves the GDP down 3.8 percent at the end of the year. A truly stunning and brutal economic forecast from Goldman Sachs: pic.twitter.com/2gvvs15RhF â€” James Pethokoukis (@JimPethokoukis) March 20, 2020 Goldman Sachs formulated its prediction by looking at past unemployment rates, the effects of Hurricane Katrina, and 'job losses by sector and occupation.' And it all forecasts a far more economically brutal future than the one the bank saw just a few days ago. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>
