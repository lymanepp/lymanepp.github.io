      <title>At 31, Tim Tebow is one final step from MLB...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/At-31-with-the-NFL-behind-him-Tim-Tebow-is-one-13769494.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SYRACUSE, N.Y. - Tim Tebow was 18 years old, in green shorts and a gray T-shirt, walking from left field toward home plate for an offseason chat. He'd come to meet with his high school baseball coach, Greg Mullins, after school. Something's wrong, Mullins thought as Tebow approached. "Can we talk?" Tebow asked, and they moved to the dugout bench.  It was 2005, and Tebow, not yet a celebrity, had plotted out his future. His voice wavered. A few minutes into the conversation, Tebow shed a tear. He wouldn't play his senior season of baseball. He had decided to enroll early at Florida to pursue a football career.  "One of the hardest decisions I ever made was choosing to go football over baseball," Tebow said this month of that day at Nease High School in Florida, just south of Jacksonville. "It's an itch I've always had and a passion I've always had, and it didn't go away after years."  It's been 13 and a half years since the day Tebow's baseball career ended. Well, could have ended. Now, just weeks into year three of a rise through the minors, Tebow is one step from the major leagues. One step from his ultimate dream, which he set out for after his professional football career ended. While his foundation was growing and he was working as an ESPN college football analyst, he considered how the rest of his life would go. Maybe he'd give his "first love" another try. Maybe he'd try to play in the majors.  As his baseball odyssey extends into this spring, the question is how he'll handle the pitching for the Class AAA Syracuse Mets. The task at hand: cut down on strikeouts, hit for power, track down fly balls in the outfield. In Class AA, he struck out in more than 30 percent of his at-bats, but he hit a respectable .273. Through nine games this season, he's 5 for 31 with 13 strikeouts.  At 31, he is now being recognized for...</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thousands of people around the world are watching Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral burn. Teams of professionals are likely collaborating to extinguish the flames. And yet from thousands of miles away, President Trump has still decided to weigh in with some unhelpful advice. As videos reveal the church's roof and spire has collapsed, America's notorious firefighting expert suggested some "flying water tankers" should take care of it. So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2019 Surprisingly, Trump did not recommend raking the cathedral's floors to prevent future incidents. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>Funeral as we know becoming relic -- just in time for death boom...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/The-funeral-as-we-know-it-is-becoming-a-relic-13767619.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dayna West knows how to throw a fabulous memorial shindig. She hired Los Angeles celebration-of-life planner Alison Bossert - yes, those now exist - to create what West dubbed "Memorialpalooza" for her father, Howard, in 2016 a few months after his death.  "None of us is going to get out of this alive," says Bossert, who helms Final Bow Productions. "We can't control how or when we die, but we can say how we want to be remembered."  At Howard's remembrance, there was a crowd of more than 300 people at Sony Pictures Studios. A hot-dog cart from the famed L.A. stand Pink's. Gift bags, the hit being a baseball cap inscribed with "Life's not fair, get over it" (a beloved Howardism). A constellation of speakers, with Jerry Seinfeld as the closer (Howard was his personal manager). And babka (a tribute to a favorite "Seinfeld" episode).  "My dad never followed rules," says West, 56, a Bay Area clinical psychologist. So why would his memorial service?  Death is a given, but not the time-honored rituals. An increasingly secular, nomadic and casual America is shredding the rules about how to commemorate death, and it's not just among the wealthy and famous. Somber, embalmed-body funerals, with their $9,000 industry average price tag, are, for many families, a relic. Instead, end-of-life ceremonies are being personalized: golf-course cocktail send-offs, backyard potluck memorials, more Sinatra and Clapton, less "Ave Maria," more Hawaiian shirts, fewer dark suits. Families want to put the "fun" in funerals.  The movement will accelerate as the nation approaches a historic spike in deaths. Baby boomers, despite strenuous efforts to stall the aging process, are not getting any younger. In 2030, people over 65 are expected to outnumber children, and by 2037, 3.6 million people are projected to die in the United States, according to the...</description>
