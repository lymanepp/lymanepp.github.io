      <title>Desperate Biden lashes out...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/893878/biden-dares-buttigieg-call-obama-administration-failure</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Vice President Joe Biden got candid on Wednesday in New Hampshire. He admitted to his supporters that his campaign 'took a gut punch' in Iowa, as results â€” which are incomplete and preliminary â€” have him in fourth place. He wasn't completely pessimistic, though, pointing out he's taken similar hits before (for what it's worth, he never recovered from his Iowa struggles in past presidential bids) and that he's staying in the race regardless. In Somersworth, N,H., @JoeBiden responds to @PeteButtigieg for calling him part of the â€œold failed Washingtonâ€� by listing Obama-era accomplishments. â€œIs he really saying the Obama Biden administration was a failure? Pete, just say it out loud.â€™â€™ â€” Janet Hook (@hookjan) February 5, 2020 He also went after former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who looks like he has a good shot at emerging victorious once the dust finally settles in Iowa. Buttigieg had earlier described Biden as a member of the 'old failed Washington,' which prompted Biden to dare his younger competitor to take his criticism a step further and direct it at former President Barack Obama. Buttigieg so far hasn't taken up the offer. In Somersworth, N,H., @JoeBiden responds to @PeteButtigieg for calling him part of the â€œold failed Washingtonâ€� by listing Obama-era accomplishments. â€œIs he really saying the Obama Biden administration was a failure? Pete, just say it out loud.â€™â€™ â€” Janet Hook (@hookjan) February 5, 2020 Biden wasn't done there. He kept on the offensive and also targeted Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who he said would bind all Democrats to the Democratic-Socialist label should the party nominate the senator. Tim O'Donnell</description>

      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Caffeine-has-been-a-boon-for-civilization-15031811.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Pollan laughs and says, yes, he's on drugs while conducting this interview. Okay, he doesn't use those exact words, but he acknowledges that he has a "tall, takeout container" of half-caff coffee at his side as we discuss, via phone, his latest project, simply titled "Caffeine," available only as an audio book from Audible.  Pollan, the author of "The Omnivore's Dilemma," "The Botany of Desire," "In Defense of Food" and "How to Change Your Mind" - in which he has explored our complicated relationship with food, plants, drugs and many other things we take for granted - has turned his imposing analytical skills to caffeine, the most popular mind-altering chemical on the planet.  "For most of us, to be caffeinated to one degree or another has simply become baseline human consciousness," Pollan writes, well, reads in "Caffeine." "Something like 90% of humans ingest caffeine regularly, making it the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world and the only one we routinely give to children, commonly in the form of soda. It's so pervasive that it's easy to overlook the fact that to be caffeinated is not baseline consciousness but, in fact, is an altered state."  After others suggested the idea, Pollan decided to get off caffeine, cold turkey, to better understand the stimulant's effects on human consciousness. Last year, he abstained from coffee and tea for three months. As he notes in "Caffeine," the experiment nearly killed his enthusiasm for the book. "How can you possibly expect to write anything when you can't concentrate?" Pollan writes about his withdrawal symptoms, a state so intense that it's officially classified as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association.  When Pollan ended his caffeine fast, he promised himself to drink coffee and tea only on Saturdays. Our interview was on a Monday....</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.arabnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;RABAT: A record 13 million tourists visited Morocco in 2019, up 5.2 percent from the previous year, official figures showed Wednesday. The number includes Moroccans from the diaspora, who account for around half of visitors annually. Tourism revenues hit 78.6 billion dirhams ($8.16 billion) in 2019, up from 73.04 billion dirhams ($7.58 billion) the year before, the Moroccan Tourism Observatory said. It attributed the rise — for the first crossing the 12-million mark — to its primary markets, France and Spain.</description>

      <title>Trapped on virus-ravaged cruise ship, shocked passengers struggle to keep spirits up...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;YOKOHAMA, Japan - Quarantined for two weeks on a cruise ship ravaged by coronavirus, the Britons on board have only one option: keep calm and carry on.  David Abel and his wife Sally are still smiling, for now. Their friends Alan and Wendy Steele are going "stir crazy" trapped in their cabin - although they say they are not worried about catching the deadly illness. Still, this was not how the Steeles planned to spend their honeymoon.  Many of the 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members on the Diamond Princess are struggling to keep their spirits up, after the luxury liner was quarantined off the Japanese coast Wednesday, with passengers forbidden to leave their cabins.  Last Saturday, a man from Hong Kong who had spent five days aboard the ship was confirmed as having contracted coronavirus. On Wednesday, with the ship docked at the port of Yokohama, Japan's Health Ministry said nine other passengers and one Filipino crew member had tested positive.  "We've got two weeks' extra cruise, albeit a confined cruise," David Abel, 74, said on a Skype call from his cabin. "You've got to make the best of the situation, haven't you? But I'm sure that in 10 or 12 days' time, I'll be pulling my hair out."  The nine passengers who tested positive - two Australians, three from Japan, three from Hong Kong, and one American - have been transferred to hospitals, but none is in serious condition, said Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato. They were among 31 people deemed at high risk who were initially examined for the virus, while samples from 242 other people are still being tested.  For those left on board, there is nothing to do but sit in their cabins, wait for meals to be delivered, watch television or a choose from a limited selection of movies on demand. Those lucky enough to have a balcony can at least sit in the sun, look at...</description>

America is the place where anything can happen. America is the place where anyone can rise. Here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true. This nation is our canvas and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see a limited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American age, the American epic, the American adventure has only just begun. Our spirit is still young. The sun is still rising. God's grace is still shining. My fellow Americans, the best is yet to come. Thank you. Thank you very much.</description>
