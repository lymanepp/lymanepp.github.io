      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/A-college-student-died-in-his-dorm-room-It-took-14466774.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rank odor from the end of the hallway had become too strong to ignore.  For nearly two months, it was faint enough that nobody at the University of Canterbury realized that a young man was dead, and decomposing, in his own room. Students left campus for two weeks of vacation, and returned, and still no one noticed anything.  But on Monday, police finally made it to the Sonoda dorm at the suburban campus outside Christchurch, New Zealand, where authorities discovered the body of a first-year student, local media reported. The student's father, who could not reach the young man through his friends, had also contacted police.  The young man's body had gone untouched for so long that police had to call in a special team to examine fingerprints, DNA and dental records so they could confirm his identity, Detective Senior Sgt. Craig Johnson told reporters. Most details surrounding the incident, including the student's name and age, had not been made public as of early Wednesday, and the coroner is still investigating the cause of death.  Amid an outcry from university students that's gone all the way up to New Zealand's education minister this week, a university is grappling with a grim question: How could a dead student go undiscovered for so long?  For now, no one really seems to know.  "It is inconceivable to imagine how these circumstances could have occurred," Cheryl de la Rey, the university's vice chancellor, said in a statement to The Washington Post.  De la Rey said Wednesday that the university will commission an independent investigation to examine the oversight, despite what she called an "extensive" well-being program to support students.  She declined to comment further to respect the family of the student. "This is an extremely distressing time for University...</description>

      <title>Trump meeting with Ukrainian president high-wire act...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Trump-s-meeting-with-Ukrainian-president-is-a-14466266.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK - President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday as he seeks to dispel concerns about his decision to temporarily hold nearly $400 million of military aid from the embattled country.  The meeting is a high-wire act for both leaders as Zelensky tries to avoid angering the U.S. president or his Democratic opponents while Trump tries to disarm allegations that have generated a formal impeachment inquiry by the Democratic-controlled House.  At issue is a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump is said to have brought up investigating former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 presidential opponent, and his son. Days before the phone call, Trump ordered a hold on the aid for Ukraine, which has been fending off Russian-backed separatists in the country's east.  Trump has denied the suggestion that he linked the disbursement of U.S. military aid to Ukraine's willingness to investigate Biden's son, saying Tuesday that he withheld the aid over a concern that European countries were not contributing enough to help support Ukraine.  "My complaint has always been, and I'd withhold again, and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it," Trump told reporters.  Zelensky is just one of a dozen leaders Trump is meeting in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, but the tête-à-tête became a focal point of the global gathering after a whistleblower from the U.S. intelligence community raised allegations about Trump's behavior.  The Trump administration has blocked Congress from seeing the complaint. But Trump authorized the release of a transcript of the call, which is expected to be made public hours before his meeting with Zelensky.  "For the Ukrainians, this is a...</description>

      <title>'Newsworthiness' allows politicians to spread misinformation on socials...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/opinion/article/Newsworthiness-allows-politicians-to-spread-14466309.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Social media companies are attempting to reassure the public that this time, in 2020, they will not allow themselves to be transformed into misinformation delivery systems. That is what Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs, wanted to convey Tuesday at the Atlantic Festival.  Something Clegg said, however, caught the attention of many who are wary of Facebook's reassurances about preventing misinformation from going viral on its platform.  "It is not our role to intervene when politicians speak," he said. "We do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules."  Facebook announced in December 2016 that it would use third-party fact-checkers to examine flagged content on the site, which would then be down-ranked in people's news feeds and sometimes appear with a debunking link. The program has faced some criticism for not being transparent enough with the fact-checking partners and for removing fact checks on controversial topics after political pressure.  This policy, which Facebook said has been in place for more than a year, will only display fact checks on previously debunked topics that are re-shared by politicians.  Facebook called the policy sparing politicians from fact checks part of its "newsworthiness exemption." Basically, if something on Facebook is newsworthy, or in the public interest, but violates its community standards, the website can keep the content up by citing the exemption. The newsworthiness exemption, introduced shortly before the 2016 elections, is a loophole in the company's moderation rules that was inspired by a very different kind of content: Facebook had caused a scandal by censoring a famous photograph of a girl fleeing a U.S. bomb strike during the...</description>

      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Giuliani-ran-shadowy-Ukraine-policy-sidelining-14465570.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists - including the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani - to exploit the U.S. relationship with Kiev, current and former U.S. officials said.  The sequence, which began early this year, involved the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, the circumvention of senior officials on the National Security Council, and the suspension of hundreds of millions of dollars of aid administered by the Defense and State departments - all as key officials from these agencies struggled to piece together Giuliani's activities from news reports.  Several officials described tense meetings on Ukraine among national security officials at the White House leading up to the president's phone call on July 25, sessions that led some participants to fear that Trump and those close to him appeared prepared to use U.S. leverage with the new leader of Ukraine for Trump's political gain.  As those worries intensified, some senior officials worked behind the scenes to hold off a Trump meeting or call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky out of concern that Trump would use the conversation to press Kiev for damaging information on Trump's potential rival in the 2020 race, former vice president Joe Biden, and Biden's son, Hunter.  "An awful lot of people were trying to keep a meeting from happening for the reason that it would not be focused on Ukraine-U.S. relations," one former official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.  White House officials disputed these accounts, saying that no such concerns were raised in National Security Council meetings and that Trump's focus was on urging...</description>
