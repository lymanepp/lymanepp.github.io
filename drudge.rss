      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;TAIPEI, Taiwan - Chinese police on Monday seized the Tsinghua University professor and essayist Xu Zhangrun, silencing one of the last voices within China's besieged intellectual circles who dared to openly and persistently criticize President Xi Jinping's leadership.  Xu's arrest in Beijing's outskirts came five months after he published a lengthy essay pleading with political leaders to conduct an open investigation into the coverup of the covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan and reverse the country's spiral into tyranny. What began as a local outbreak was exacerbated by a political system that stifled whistleblowers and "a rot that goes right up to Beijing," Xu wrote in his February piece, which he predicted would be "the last piece I write."  Friends in Beijing, some speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said Xu was taken away early Monday. A widely circulated statement on social media from Xu's friends, which could not be independently confirmed, said Xu's home was surrounded by 20 police officers, who took away Xu and his computer.  Tsinghua University's Law Department, where Xu taught constitutional law until he was demoted last year for his political writing, said Monday it was "not clear" about Xu's situation. Beijing's public security department declined to comment.  One friend who met Xu on Saturday said the professor was in high spirits as he gathered with friends after weeks of isolation; Xu had been barred from leaving his home during the politically sensitive month of June, when some dissidents commemorate the anniversary of the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, but did not seem to be under an unusual degree of pressure.  But Xu's arrest was not wholly unexpected, coming at a time when the Communist Party is forcefully reasserting itself not only globally - over territorial disputes...</description>

      <title>UPDATE:  Duckworth emerges as serious contender...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/Duckworth-emerges-as-contender-for-Biden-running-15387527.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - As Joe Biden pushes ahead with his search for a running mate, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., has quietly emerged as a serious contender, according to three people with knowledge of the selection process, one of several developing dynamics as the search enters its final weeks.  Duckworth is a Purple Heart recipient and veteran of the Iraq War, the only finalist with military combat experience - and as a woman of Thai and Chinese descent, one of several candidates of color under consideration. While she has a lower profile than some rivals, she is being taken seriously by Biden's team, according to the people with knowledge of the search, one of whom said she has lately received strong consideration.  Former Senate majority leader Harry Reid, who has been in direct contact with the Biden campaign about its search, said in a recent interview that there was a "lot of attention" lately on Duckworth, whom he called "a highly decorated woman."  Reid suggested Duckworth's qualifications are getting more attention. "You had all the other names there, and it was as if she didn't exist," Reid said. "And suddenly people began to look at her - this highly decorated woman, member of Congress, senator."  Two others with knowledge of the search said Duckworth has been attracting notable interest from the campaign, including one who said Duckworth had left a strong impression on at least part of the Biden team. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.  The Biden campaign declined to comment.  Duckworth's emergence comes as some Biden allies say former senator Chris Dodd, D-Conn., a close friend of Biden's, is taking a primary role in the search process. It is also unfolding as Republicans prepare to launch fierce attacks on whoever is chosen as...</description>

      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trump-turned-July-4-into-a-partisan-event-and-15387416.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Donald Trump, with two speeches in two days, has turned the Fourth of July from a joyful and unifying patriotic celebration of America's founding values into a partisan political event. The damage could outlast his presidency.  From near the base of Mount Rushmore on Friday night and from the South Lawn of the White House on Saturday night, Trump tried to write himself into the history of America as an implacable wartime president. His enemy, however, is not the Nazis of the 20th century or terrorists of the 21st century. Instead, it appears to be those in America who disagree with him - a caricatured blue America.  Trump knows his reelection campaign is in trouble. He sees the fight against this enemy of his creation as his pathway to victory in November. His political weapon of choice is exaggerated and at times racist rhetoric designed to pit Americans against Americans. Never in our lifetimes has the Independence Day holiday been used for such divisive and personal ends.  He put it this way on Friday night: "Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children." On Saturday night, he said this: "We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children or trample on our freedoms. We will safeguard our values, traditions, customs and beliefs."  The president speaks for and to a portion of the country. People can debate how large or small his base is at this point, but the rhetoric of these recent days resonates as much as it divides. Political polarization is real. Identity politics - on both sides - is real.  The culture war, broadly defined, rages across the country, whether the issue is masks or statues. The pandemic seems to have added fuel to that bonfire, and the president...</description>
