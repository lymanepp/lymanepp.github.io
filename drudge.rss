      <title>Border crossings continue to drop -- but Mexican migrants surging...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/U-S-Mexico-border-crossings-continue-to-drop-15048206.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - The number of migrants taken into custody along the U.S.-Mexico border declined for an eighth straight month in January, but unauthorized crossings by Mexican nationals are on the rise, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.  Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan said Tuesday that U.S. officials apprehended or deemed "inadmissible" 36,679 migrants in January, a drop of 10% from December. But he said the number of Mexican adults taken into custody has climbed 32% from this time last year, a shift he attributed to smugglers "scrambling to come up with new tactics" as overall migration numbers have fallen.  "While this number represents the eighth straight month of declines, smuggling organizations are changing their tactics," Morgan said. "They're looking to other vulnerable groups."  Morgan said that at this time last year, approximately 61% of the migrants U.S. officials encountered were from the northern triangle countries - Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. "Now, eight months later, that same percent, about 61%, are actually Mexican nationals," Morgan said.  Morgan attributed the overall decline to the Trump administration's immigration policies, which he said have enabled authorities to quickly deport "95%"of the migrants encountered along the U.S.-Mexico border, including tens of thousands of Central American asylum seekers who have been sent to Mexican border towns to await their U.S. court hearings.  "If we encounter you, if you're illegally in this country, you will not be allowed in the United States," he said. "You will be promptly removed and returned."  Morgan defended the policies in the face of a report released Tuesday by Doctors Without Borders, which found that asylum seekers who have to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court hearings were facing high levels of violence.
