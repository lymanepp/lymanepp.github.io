      <title>Fed begins pumping municipal bonds...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/Federal-Reserve-backstops-muni-bond-market-as-15145736.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Federal Reserve capped off an unprecedented week of action Friday by extending a lifeline to cash-strapped state and local governments that are about to borrow large sums as they deal with skyrocketing costs from coronavirus safety measures.  There has been a large selloff in municipal debt in recent days, driving up the borrowing costs for many states and localities that need to pay their bills.  This is the ninth major action by the Fed this week to try to stabilize financial markets, prevent the downturn from worsening and keep credit flowing to companies and households.  The Fed will make loans available to financial institutions that can be secured by "high quality" state and local bonds. This will make owning these tax-exempt municipal bonds more attractive and should help ensure there is plenty of demand for these bonds as many states and cities begin to issue more debt in the coming weeks and months.  "The Federal Reserve Board on Friday expanded its program of support for the flow of credit to the economy by taking steps to enhance the liquidity and functioning of crucial state and municipal money markets," the Fed said in a statement.  Earlier this week, the central bank slashed interest rates to zero, re-started massive purchases of U.S. Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, began making 0.25% loans to banks and announced backstops for numerous parts of the credit market.  Goldman Sachs predicted Thursday that over 2 million Americans likely lost their jobs this week and many companies could go bankrupt in the next three months if they do not get aid. The Fed's actions are an effort to make as many cheap loans and lines of credit available to households and businesses as possible to make it through the coronavirus recession.</description>

      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/903646/goldman-sachs-devastating-revision-gdp-growth-predictions</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goldman Sachs predicts the coronavirus crash will be bigger than it originally thought. In a Friday research note, the bank projected a 24 percent drop in the U.S. GDP in the second quarter â€” a stark revision from its prediction of a five percent drop earlier this week. Goldman Sachs does see a slight rebound in Q3 and Q4 of 12 percent and 10 percent, respectively, but that still leaves the GDP down 3.8 percent at the end of the year. A truly stunning and brutal economic forecast from Goldman Sachs: pic.twitter.com/2gvvs15RhF â€” James Pethokoukis (@JimPethokoukis) March 20, 2020 Goldman Sachs formulated its prediction by looking at past unemployment rates, the effects of Hurricane Katrina, and 'job losses by sector and occupation.' And it all forecasts a far more economically brutal future than the one the bank saw just a few days ago. Kathryn Krawczyk</description>

      <title>Virus killing far more men than women...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/The-coronavirus-is-killing-far-more-men-than-women-15143405.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With more than 200,000 coronavirus cases worldwide and thousands of deaths, a striking pattern is appearing in the hardest-hit countries: More men are dying than women.  No where is this trend more pronounced than in Italy. Men make up nearly 60% of people with confirmed cases of the virus and more than 70% of those who have died from covid-19, according to the country's main public health research agency.  On the other end of the spectrum is South Korea, where about 61% of confirmed infections have been in women. Though far fewer patients have died, the majority of fatalities - 54% -- were again in men.  As the pandemic escalates, epidemiologists and public health authorities are scrambling to understand who is most vulnerable and how to protect them. The data from countries such as Italy and South Korea show that the disease can take wildly different paths.  Exactly what makes a group vulnerable - and how to protect them - has experts "mystified," said Carlos del Rio, chair of the department of global health at Emory University. "This difference in mortality is creating a lot of anxiety," he added.  The outbreak of covid-19 in Italy is the deadliest in the world. As of March 17, more than 40,000 people there have been sickened with the virus, and 3,405 have died. That means that, based on these current and unavoidably incomplete figures, 8.2 percent of people infected in the country have died. That is more than double the global figure presented recently by the WHO.  Italy's aging population is probably particularly susceptible to the disease, researchers say. With a median age of 46.5, according to the CIA World Factbook, it is the fifth oldest country in the world. And these elderly citizens are those who have become the sickest: People over the age of 70 represent...</description>
