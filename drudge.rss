      <title>Chief Justice John Roberts hospitalized last month after injuring his head in  fall...</title>
      <link>https://www.thehour.com/news/article/High-court-Chief-justice-hospitalized-last-month-15392894.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.thehour.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. suffered a fall at a Maryland country club last month that required an overnight stay in the hospital, a Supreme Court spokeswoman confirmed Tuesday night.  The 65-year-old chief justice was taken by ambulance to a hospital after the June 21 incident at the Chevy Chase Club, which was serious enough to require sutures. He stayed at the hospital overnight for observation and was released the next morning.  Roberts has twice experienced seizures, in 1993 and in 2007, but Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said doctors ruled out that possibility in the latest incident. Doctors believe he was dehydrated, she said.  Roberts did not publicly disclose the matter, and the court's confirmation came in response to an inquiry from The Washington Post, which received a tip.  The scene was apparently witnessed by some at the club, whose list of politically connected members includes another justice, Brett Kavanaugh. The person who told The Post about the incident said Roberts's head was covered in blood.  The statement from Arberg said: "The Chief Justice was treated at a hospital on June 21 for an injury to his forehead sustained in a fall while walking for exercise near his home. The injury required sutures, and out of an abundance of caution, he stayed in the hospital overnight and was discharged the next morning. His doctors ruled out a seizure. They believe the fall was likely due to light-headedness caused by dehydration."  The statement did not address why Roberts had not disclosed his hospitalization.  Roberts suffered a seizure in July 2007 at his vacation home in Maine. He fell from a dock after experiencing what the court described as a "benign idiopathic seizure." That means there was no easily identifiable cause for the...</description>

      <title>Beijing's secret police get room with view in Hong Kong...</title>
      <link>https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Beijing-s-secret-police-get-a-room-with-a-view-in-15393411.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.lmtonline.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;HONG KONG - When China's state security officials came to town, they needed a home - and fast.  So they did what any newcomer would do: They sequestered a 33-story hotel with a rooftop pool and panoramic harbor views, then erected 7-foot-high barriers to limit public access to their new digs.  Early Wednesday, under a heavy police presence and before any public announcement about the matter, officials inaugurated the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region at a ceremony that took place behind water-filled barricades. They played the Chinese national anthem and raised the Chinese flag, though local media weren't invited. When the ceremony was over, reporters were finally able to photograph the building's front door.  The Metropark Hotel on the edge of the city's Causeway Bay district will be the initial base for the new agency, tasked with collecting intelligence and implementing a new law that sharply curtails political freedoms as Beijing takes fuller control of the territory after anti-government protests last year.  It's the first time the Chinese government's state security apparatus has been permitted to operate in Hong Kong, marking a milestone in officials' efforts to dismantle the firewall that separated the city from the authoritarian mainland.  The security law, which took effect July 1, specifies four broadly defined crimes against national security that can invite punishment of up to life imprisonment: subversion, secession, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. In practice, lawyers and other experts say, it effectively extends mainland legal provisions to Hong Kong, ending the autonomy that China promised the financial center would enjoy until 2047.  The new office is headed by Zheng Yanxiong, a senior Communist Party...</description>

      <title>BUCS coach says his players will 'all get sick' when NFL returns...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/Buccaneers-coach-says-his-players-will-all-get-15393482.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When NFL teams reconvene for the 2020 season, Bruce Arians knows he has more reason than most to take precautions amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. Not only is his age, 67, a significant risk factor, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach has had procedures over the years to remove cancerous tumors.  Thus Arians plans to wear extra personal protective gear and have his staff adhere closely to safety protocols.  As for his players - now including soon-to-be-43-year-old Tom Brady - Arians appears to feel that there will be no avoiding illness. And not just for some of them, but as he put it Monday to the Tampa Bay Times, "all" of them.  "The players, they're going to all get sick, that's for sure," Arians said. "It's just a matter of how sick they get."  Buccaneers players are scheduled to report for training camp in two weeks, following the kind of virtual offseason all NFL teams have been conducting since March. That has meant participating in team-conducted training sessions via teleconferencing, not in meeting rooms and on practice fields.  Brady, though, has been organizing informal, in-person practice sessions in Tampa since May, when Florida loosened stay-at-home orders. While that has helped the former New England Patriots quarterback and six-time Super Bowl winner become more familiar with his new teammates, he has also been doing so in defiance of a recommendation last month by the NFL Players Association.  Florida is now one of the foremost coronavirus hotspots in a nation that has seen rates of new infections shoot upward since June, with at least 128,000 dead. That has complicated the plans to return to play not only of the NFL but several prominent sports leagues in the United States.  Major League Soccer chose to withdraw one of its teams, FC Dallas, from a...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Republicans-split-over-whether-to-attend-the-15392709.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Republicans' determination to press ahead with a convention next month despite escalating covid-19 cases in the host city of Jacksonville, Fla., is prompting a growing split in the party, with some GOP leaders saying they'll stay home and others stressing the importance of attending to show support for President Donald Trump.  Politicians, donors and party officials, especially seniors at higher risk of complications from the disease, now face a difficult choice between a personal risk to their health and a potential backlash from the president and his supporters. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., 78, indicated Tuesday he will attend the convention, but two other top Senate Republicans, Iowa's Charles Grassley, 86, and Tennessee's Lamar Alexander, 80, are taking a pass.  They are joined by two of the most senior Republican women in the Senate. Maine's Susan Collins, 67, said though a spokesman that she avoids attending the party convention in years when she is facing reelection. Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, 63, also has no plans to attend, according to a spokesperson, nor does Utah's Mitt Romney, 73.  Collins, Murkowski and Romney have criticized Trump on occasion, making their presence potentially uncomfortable at an event that will largely be a tribute to the president. But Grassley made it clear his decision is motivated solely by fear of contracting covid-19.  "I'm not going to go because of the virus situation," Grassley said Monday on a conference call with reporters.  Trump himself signaled Tuesday some flexibility regarding the convention. "When we signed a few weeks ago, it looked good. And now all of a sudden it's spiking up a little bit and that's going to go down," the president told television host Greta Van Susteren. "It really depends on the timing. . . . We can do a lot of things,...</description>

      <title>Residents worry situation will get much worse...</title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Florida-invited-the-nation-to-its-reopening-15392818.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - As the coronavirus savaged other parts of the country, Florida, buoyed by low infection rates, seemed an ideal location for a nation looking to emerge from isolation. The Republican National Convention moved from Charlotte to Jacksonville, the NBA eyed a season finale at a Disney sports complex near Orlando and millions packed onto once-empty beaches.  Weeks later, the Sunshine State has emerged as a coronavirus epicenter. Nearly 1 out of every 100 residents is infected with the virus, hospital intensive care units are full or filling up, and big-name visitors who chose Florida for their first post-isolation events are now mired in questions and controversies about safety.  Amid escalating infections, Florida, once held up by President Donald Trump as a model for how to manage the novel coronavirus, is faring poorly. Residents worry the situation will get much worse. Florida is now one of a handful of states whose spiking numbers are driving a major resurgence of the virus in the United States, which is approaching 3 million cases.  Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has downplayed the growing outbreak in Florida, saying expanded testing is responsible for more positive results and emphasizing that many new infections are among younger people less likely to experience the worst effects of the virus.  On Tuesday there were 213,794 cases of the coronavirus in Florida, according to Washington Post data. The state has tallied a record number of cases over the past week, averaging 8,766 a day, according to Post data.  In a sign of intensifying trouble, 52 intensive care units across more than a third of the state's counties had reached capacity by Tuesday, according to data released by the state's Agency for Health Care Administration. Another 17 hospitals had also run out of regular beds. The state has...</description>
