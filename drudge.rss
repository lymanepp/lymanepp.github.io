      <title>Economic crisis in Kentucky has workers, businesses furious with McConnell...</title>
      <link>https://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/An-economic-crisis-in-Kentucky-has-workers-15474739.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The parade of cars honked incessantly as they crawled past the federal courthouse on West Broadway, their message clear to anyone who bothered to steal a glance at their signs outside.  "Mitch better have my money."  The Kentucky representatives from the AFL-CIO, Teamsters and other labor groups had grown incensed with Mitch McConnell, their home state senator and the chamber's most powerful lawmaker. For months, they said, he had been blocking much-needed congressional coronavirus aid, the kind of dollars that might help workers and businesses in the Bluegrass State struggling to survive financially.  So they hit the streets on Thursday, drove down to McConnell's Louisville office and started to circle the block, their 30 or so vehicles plastered with not-so-subtle orange and gray signs featuring a family-friendly rewrite of a popular Rihanna tune.  The labor protest marked only the latest in a series of exasperated complaints from Kentuckians directed at McConnell, a Republican, as some locals find themselves frustrated by the absence of their powerful political representative on Capitol Hill. In more than two dozen interviews, out-of-work residents, struggling restaurant owners and other business leaders, as well as a cadre of annoyed food, housing and labor rights groups, all said they are in dire need of more support from Congress - the likes of which McConnell has not been able to provide.  About five months after Kentucky reported its first loss of life from covid-19, its economy continues to sputter amid the coronavirus pandemic. Many unemployed workers say their benefit checks aren't enough to afford their bills, and some here simply have stopped looking for jobs. Businesses say they're also hemorrhaging cash, and local governments fear they're on the precipice of financial ruin, too.  The economic tumult in...</description>

      <title>Grocery workers say morale all-time low: 'They don't treat us like humans anymore'...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/business/article/Grocery-workers-say-morale-is-at-an-all-time-low-15477599.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This spring, for the first time, Angel Manners found purpose and pride at the supermarket where she has worked the past decade. Customers praised her as a hero for putting herself at risk during the pandemic. Bosses boosted her hourly pay by $2. Suddenly, her job was essential.  Nearly five months in, and it is all gone.  "In the last month, we've lost our hazard pay, and people are quitting every day," said Manners, 43, who processes vendor deliveries at a Meijer store in northern Kentucky. "Those of us who are left are really stretched thin - working so much harder for $11.50 an hour."  Grocer workers across the country say morale is crushingly low as the pandemic wears on with no end in sight. Overwhelmed employees are quitting mid-shift. Those who remain say they are overworked, taking on extra hours, enforcing mask requirements and dealing with hostile customers. Most retailers have done away with hazard pay even as workers remain vulnerable to infection, or worse. Employees who took sick leave at the beginning of the pandemic say they cannot afford to take unpaid time off now, even if they feel unwell.  The mounting despair is heightened by the lack of other job options: Supermarkets are among the few bright spots in an industry that has been ravaged by covid-related store closures and a sharp drop-off in consumer spending. The retail sector has shed 913,000 jobs and chalked up more than a dozen bankruptcies during the pandemic.  "At the beginning they valorized what was deemed a dead-end job, but four months later they don't even treat us like humans anymore," said Fox Wingate, 24, who works at a Safeway in Maryland.  Workers' renewed sense of expendability comes after four straight months of double-digit unemployment. With more than 32 million Americans collecting unemployment benefits, labor experts and...</description>

      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/The-Latest-Trump-campaign-blasts-Kamala-Harris-15476254.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden's selection of California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate (all times local):  6 p.m.  President Donald Trump says he's "a little surprised" that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Trump told reporters at a White House briefing that Harris "was very disrespectful to Joe Biden" during the Democratic primaries, and said "it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful."  He's also noting that Harris "did very poorly" when she ran for the nomination - she dropped out in December - and says, "That's like a poll."  Trump is trying to paint Harris as too far left, saying she wants to raise taxes, slash funds for the militarily and ban fracking. He's also noting her tough questioning of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearing.  Trump says, "She was my No. 1 draft pick and we'll see how she works out."  Biden's campaign announced his decision to pick Harris as his running mate earlier Tuesday.  Trump last month had said she would be "a fine choice."  __  5:50 p.m.  Vice President Mike Pence is welcoming his Democratic rival to the race after former vice president Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Speaking in Arizona, the Republican used the opportunity to attack the Biden-Harris ticket. "As you all know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left," Pence said. "So given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and abortion on demand, it's no surprise that he chose Senator Harris."  Pence plugged the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, scheduled to take place in Utah....</description>
