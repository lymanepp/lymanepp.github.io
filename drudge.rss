      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The email came just hours into the new year, landing in the inboxes of the two renowned French gerontologists who had validated the age of the oldest person ever documented in the modern world. Also copied was the consultant who analyzed age-related cases for the Guinness World Records, which had given Jeanne Calment the title before she died at 122 in 1997. "Colleagues, take action, take evidence for verification," read the email, from the account of Russian doctor Valery Novoselov, continuing in cryptically rendered English. "Otherwise, there will be many people who will want to participate in this show.</description>

      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Hi-I-m-Tom-Brady-How-the-Patriots-13528788.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - Phillip Dorsett sat on a table inside the New England Patriots' training room, having just completed the physical that made him an official member of the franchise. Just then, one of his new teammates entered the room and walked straight toward him. "Hi," the teammate said. "I'm Tom Brady." "I'm like, I know who you are," Dorsett said this week, laughing. "You don't have to introduce yourself." Dorsett, a wide receiver, is like almost every other Patriot. As Brady was winning Super Bowls and becoming an international celebrity, Dorsett was growing up. He was 9 when Brady won his first Super Bowl.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;SEATTLE (AP) — Riding the momentum from November's elections, Democratic leaders in the states are wasting no time delivering on their biggest campaign promise — to expand access to health care and make it more affordable. The first full week of state legislative sessions and swearings-in for governors saw a flurry of proposals. In his initial actions, newly elected California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced plans to expand Medicaid to those in the country illegally up to age 26, implement a mandate that everyone buy insurance or face a fine, and consolidate the state's prescription drug purchases in the hope that it will dramatically lower costs.</description>

      <title>Technology brings images of Holocaust survivors to life...</title>
      <link>https://www.apnews.com/9fcf828b8d454169b7ebea8819ddbaed</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;DALLAS (AP) — Max Glauben was 17 and had already lost his mother, father and brother at the hands of the Nazis when U.S. troops rescued him while he was on a death march from one German concentration camp to another. The recollections of the Dallas resident who as a Jew in Poland survived the Warsaw Ghetto and Nazi concentration camps are now being preserved in a way that will allow generations to come to ask his image questions. Glauben, who turns 91 on Monday, is the latest Holocaust survivor recorded in such a way by the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation . The Los Angeles-based foundation has recorded 18 interactive testimonies with Holocaust survivors over the last several years, and executive director Stephen Smith says they're in a "race against time" as they work to add more, seeking both a diversity in experiences and testimonies in a variety of languages.</description>
