      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PANORA, Iowa - Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was in New York, finishing a speech to nearly 26,000 people. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, was on TV, carrying on an unexpected feud with the Democrats' last nominee for president. And Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., was getting a standing ovation from rural Democrats, an hour west of Des Moines, before sharing a story about a man she'd met in New Hampshire.  "He goes up to me, and he whispers: 'Don't say anything, but I voted for Donald Trump,' " Klobuchar recalled. "So I go: 'Don't worry, I won't say anything.' And he goes: 'I'm not going to do it again!' "  Seventy put-upon rural Democrats laughed and burst into applause. "I don't want to overemphasize this," Klobuchar said. "You know a lot of those Trump voters aren't going to change. But there are a segment of them, nearly 10 percent of them, who voted for Barack Obama, then voted for Donald Trump. There are a bunch of them in this state. There are a bunch of counties in this state that voted for Obama, then for Trump. We don't want to leave those counties behind."  Klobuchar, who struggled for attention in the Democratic primary, says this week's debate helped her catch on at exactly the right time. Her town halls are crowded, with staffers running to get more chairs to pack breweries or event centers. She leads the field in local endorsements, especially state legislators, "with more to come," she says. She kicked off her bus tour with the support of Andy McKean, a Republican state legislator who bolted his party six months ago and who pronounced Klobuchar the kind of Democrat who could unite America again.  "If you want to peak in this race," she said after a stop in Waterloo, "you want to peak now, instead of six months before [the caucuses]."  A few other candidates still draw larger crowds, but Klobuchar is going for a...</description>
