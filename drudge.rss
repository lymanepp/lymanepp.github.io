      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a sea lion killer on the loose in the Pacific Northwest. Or quite possibly several. Since September, the hulking carcasses of 18 of the aquatic predators have washed up on the Puget Sound shores of west Seattle and neighboring Kitsap County. A dozen contained bullets or shotgun pellets in the head, assassination-style, according to X-rays conducted by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The remaining six may also have been victims of the shooting spree, but some drifted away in the tide before state veterinarians could perform a post-mortem.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LONDON (AP) — As U.S. President Donald Trump re-imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran last month, hackers scrambled to break into personal emails of American officials tasked with enforcing them, The Associated Press has found — another sign of how deeply cyberespionage is embedded into the fabric of US-Iranian relations. The AP drew on data gathered by the London-based cybersecurity group Certfa to track how a hacking group often nicknamed Charming Kitten spent the past month trying to break into the private emails of more than a dozen U.S. Treasury officials. Also on the hackers' hit list: high-profile defenders, detractors and enforcers of the nuclear deal struck between Washington and Tehran, as well as Arab atomic scientists, Iranian civil society figures and D.C. think tank employees.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) — Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic is preparing to take the long-awaited step of trying to fly its tourism rocket ship to the edge of space. Virgin Space Ship Unity was undergoing final checks in preparation for a test flight early Thursday that could take it far higher than before and a big step closer to turning the dream of commercial space tourism into reality. "It's a day that we've been waiting for for a long time," CEO George Whitesides told reporters Wednesday at the Virgin Galactic facilities at Mojave Air and Space Port.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;STRASBOURG, France (AP) — Hundreds of security forces combed eastern France for a 29-year-old man with a long criminal record who shouted "God is great!" in Arabic and sprayed gunfire during a deadly rampage in Strasbourg's famous Christmas market, officials said. Tuesday night's attack at the Christmas market in Strasbourg killed two people, left a third brain-dead and injured 12, and was a stark reminder to a nation wounded by previous assaults that terrorism remains a threat, even as anti-government protests roil the country.</description>

Maduro repeated his frequent warning that a U.S. invasion is imminent — this time giving some details but no evidence. He accused President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton of overseeing a plot to replace him with a dictator. He alleged that Washington is using "dirty dollars, bled from the U.S. empire" to train 734 mercenaries with in neighboring Colombia to carry out the plot.</description>

One died at the scene. The other was flown to a clinic and pronounced dead shortly after. It happened Tuesday Eastern time.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;MIAMI (AP) — American diplomats affected by mysterious health incidents in Cuba showed damage in the inner ear shortly after they complained of weird noises and sensations, according to their earliest medical exams, publicized Wednesday. The detailed findings were published in a medical journal nearly two years after what the U.S. calls "health attacks" began — and they shed no new light on a possible culprit. "What caused it, who did it, why it was done — we don't know any of those things," said Dr. Michael Hoffer of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who led the exams.</description>

"That is exactly the hole we've been looking for, guys," radioed Russian Mission Control outside Moscow.
