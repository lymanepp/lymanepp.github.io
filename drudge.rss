      <title>Newly revealed USPS documents show an agency struggling to manage Trump, AMAZON and the pandemic...</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/New-documents-detail-USPS-s-spring-in-crisis-15574142.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - It would be months before Louis DeJoy took the reins of the nation's mail system, and the U.S. Postal Service already was mired in crisis.  Mail carriers were revolting, fearful they had few protections against the newly emerging coronavirus. The Trump administration was bearing down on its finances, sending USPS officials scrambling over what they saw as a potential illegal takeover of agency operations. And then there was a looming standoff with Amazon, which privately signaled it could take some of its lucrative delivery business elsewhere.  The tensions surfaced at an April 9 meeting, when Amazon executives "stated their concerns" about the Postal Service's economic plight amid the pandemic and questioned its "viability to them as a continued shipping partner," according to a once-secret memo circulated within the agency, which described the situation as an "inflection point." (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)  The wide-ranging headaches that so troubled the USPS in April ultimately foreshadowed a summer of upheaval, thrusting the once-venerated mail service into a political maelstrom months before a presidential election. Newly disclosed details of these struggles are laid bare in nearly 10,000 pages of emails, legal memos, presentations and other documents obtained by The Washington Post from American Oversight, a watchdog group that requested them under the Freedom of Information Act.  The documents, which mostly span March and April, depict an agency in distress, as its deteriorating finances collided with a public-health emergency and a looming election that would be heavily reliant on absentee ballots. During that period, the USPS occasionally relied on the legal counsel of well-connected Republicans, including Stefan C. Passantino, who once served as a top White House lawyer...</description>

      <title>Airlines selling tickets for scenic 'flights to nowhere'...</title>
      <link>https://theweek.com/speedreads/938039/airlines-are-now-selling-tickets-scenic-flights-nowhere</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;theweek.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;They take off and land at the same airport, but for some jetsetters, these 'flights to nowhere' are enough. The Association of Asia Pacific Airlines says because of the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a 97.5 percent drop in international travel in the region. Taiwan's EVA Air and Japan's ANA wanted to find a way to make money and ensure their pilots could keep their licenses, so they started offering special scenic flights. Last month, an ANA plane that is typically bound for Honolulu instead flew around for 90 minutes with 'a Hawaiian experience on board,' Reuters reports. Qantas is now following in their footsteps, offering a flight that takes off from Sydney and, after flying low over the Australian Outback and the Great Barrier Reef, lands back in Sydney seven hours later. Tickets ranged in price from $575 to $2,765, and with 134 seats available, the flight sold out in 10 minutes. A spokeswoman told Reuters on Thursday it was 'probably the fastest selling flight in Qantas history. People clearly miss travel and the experience of flying. If the demand is there, we'll definitely look at doing more of these scenic flights while we all wait for borders to open.' Chen Shu Tze, an engineer from Taipei, took advantage of Tigerair Taiwan's flight to nowhere that travels over South Korea's Jeju island. For $236, she got a seat on the plane and a one-year voucher for round-trip tickets from Taiwan to South Korea, as soon as travel bans are lifted. 'The pandemic has a devastating impact on the tourism and airline industry, so I want to help boost the economy, and I miss flying,' she told Reuters. Catherine Garcia</description>

      <title>After early virus warning, 10 days of distraction...</title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/news/article/After-early-virus-warning-10-days-of-distraction-15573335.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - In explaining why he repeatedly misled the American public about the early dangers posed by the novel coronavirus, President Donald Trump has argued that he did not want to engender panic - and suggested that his actions showed he took the looming pandemic seriously.  But a detailed review of the 10-day period from late January, when Trump was first warned about the scale of the threat, and early February - when he acknowledged to author Bob Woodward the extent of the danger the virus posed - reveals a president who took relatively few serious measures to ready the nation for its arrival.  Instead, enabled by top administration officials, Trump largely attempted to pretend the virus did not exist - spending much of his time distracted by impeachment and exacting vengeance on his political enemies. He also carried on as usual with showy political gatherings and crowded White House events.  The period would presage Trump's disjointed and often dismissive approach to the virus in the months to come, as the president and his aides repeatedly sought to diminish the danger of a pandemic that has now claimed nearly 200,000 American lives while leaving millions more infected or out of work. Trump and White House officials disagree, arguing that the president took definitive steps in the early days of the virus that showed his resolve and helped limit the death toll.  Joe Grogan, former head of the Domestic Policy Council, said that the analyses now, more than half a year later, are "all ex post facto about where this was going to go." Grogan said Trump was "focused on the issue but getting frustrated with others internally who were panicking about it because they were raising their voices and being hyperbolic."  "The president didn't want to panic people," Grogan said. "Taking a step back, messaging was a challenge....</description>

      <title>Barr issues blistering critique of his own Justice Dept... </title>
      <link>https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Barr-issues-blistering-critique-of-his-own-15573598.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.stamfordadvocate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attorney General William Barr delivered a scathing critique of his own Justice Department on Wednesday night, insisting on his absolute authority to overrule career staff, whom he said too often injected themselves into politics and went "headhunting" for high profile targets.  Speaking at an event hosted by Hillsdale College, a school with deep ties to conservative politics, Barr directly addressed the criticism that has been building for months inside the department toward his heavy hand in politically sensitive cases, particularly those involving associates of President Donald Trump.  "What exactly am I interfering with?" he asked. "Under the law, all prosecutorial power is invested in the attorney general."  Barr's comments were remarkable, in that the head of the Justice Department catalogued all of the ways in which he thought his agency had gone astray over the years, and in its current formulation harms the body politic. Barr has drawn considerable criticism for intervening in criminal cases in ways that help benefit the president's friends.  Barr said it was he, not career officials, who have the ultimate authority to decide how cases should be handled, and derided less-experienced, less-senior bureaucrats who current and former prosecutors have long insisted should be left to handle their cases free from interference from political appointees.  Barr said that argument, in essence, means "the will of the most junior member of the organization" would make decisions, but he insisted he would not "blindly" defer to "whatever those subordinates want to do."  "Letting the most junior members set the agenda might be a good philosophy for a Montessori preschool, but it is no way to run a federal agency," Barr said.  The attorney general, the nation's top law enforcement...</description>
