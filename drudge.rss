      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.greenwichtime.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARIS - President Donald Trump flew 3,800 miles to this French capital city for ceremonies to honor the military sacrifice in World War I, hoping to take part in the kind of powerful ode to the bravery of the armed forces that he was unable to hold in Washington. But on his first full day here, it rained on his substitute parade weekend. Early Saturday, the White House announced Trump and the first lady had scuttled plans, due to bad weather, for their first stop in a series of weekend remembrance activities - a visit to the solemn Aisne Marne American Cemetery, marking the ferocious Battle of Belleau Wood. It was not completely clear why the Trumps were unable to attend. The cemetery is 50 miles from Paris.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.apnews.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;PARIS (AP) — Traveling from across the world to battlefields where their soldiers fell 100 years ago, victors and vanquished alike marked those sacrifices ahead of Sunday's Armistice Day and assessed alliances that have been dramatically redrawn since those dark days. A century ago, the entry of U.S. troops into World War I tipped the momentum toward its allies, including France and Britain. On Saturday, even as he began two days of remembrance of the 1914-18 war, U.S. President Donald Trump said his nation bears far too much of the burden to defend the West.</description>
