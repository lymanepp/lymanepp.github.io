      <title>WASH POST SHOCK:  DRUDGE COVERING IMPEACHMENT!</title>
      <link>https://www.sfgate.com/lifestyle/article/Matt-Drudge-played-a-major-role-in-the-Clinton-14473330.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.sfgate.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Impeach Yourselves!" read the banner headline on Breitbart.com Wednesday morning, summing up what much of the right-wing news world thinks of the congressional impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump that had been launched the previous day.  "The psychotic anti-Trump hysteria has now completely overtaken the entire Democratic Party," Fox News anchor and Trump booster Sean Hannity told nearly 4 million viewers Tuesday.  "They think anytime a Republican is elected president, there must have been something 'illegitimate' going on," Kevin D. Williamson wrote in the National Review Thursday.  So far, so typical. This is, after all, the umpteenth Trump scandal to set the country's mainstream news outlets on fire while conservatives roll their eyes.  But there's one conspicuous exception: The Drudge Report has for the last three days been spewing ALL CAPS, bolded, underlined, and sometimes bright-red headlines that sound terribly grim for the president.  "HILL ROCKED"  "REPUBLICAN CRACKS EMERGE"  "AMERICA BRACES FOR IMPEACHMENT"  These were presumably written by the elusive Matt Drudge, who has been courted by Republican presidents and would-be presidents since he helped bring about President Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998 using exactly the same website and screaming all-capital type. In some ways Drudge's fervent coverage of "IMPEACHMENT 2019" is a return to form. But it's also an extraordinary break between the right-wing internet's godfather and its favorite president.  Drudge, who could not be reached for comment, exploded out of obscurity during the Clinton era, when he turned his political gossip blog into a fount of juicy scoops about the president.  "EXCLUSIVE ... MORE THAN 75 PIXS THAT SHOW LEWINSKY/CLINTON TOGETHER!" read a typical headline. "LEWINSKY...</description>

      <title>GERALDO:  Entire Presidency Defined By Snitches And Rats And Backstabbers...</title>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.realclearpolitics.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Friday morning on "FOX &amp; Friends," FOX News correspondent Geraldo Rivera said the whistleblower who reported President Trump's phone call with Ukraine is "a rotten snitch."  "I would love to wap him, but that is another story," he said about the whistleblower. "Imagine this poor president, his whole tenure in office has been marked by snitches and rats and backstabbers -- it’s amazing how he functions at all." GERALDO RIVERA (FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT): After listening to the Democrats, they believe that they have it now.  That everything else, Russia collusion, Stormy Daniels, taxes, making money on hotels, and all that. They are going to put everything away and they are going to laser focus on this. This is gonna be what the impeachment is all about, maybe one or two little other things fall in.  So it’s going to be the president of the United States in a conversation that was intercepted by a rotten snitch -- I’d love to wap him, but that’s another story.  Imagine this poor president, his whole tenure in office has been marked by snitches, and rats, and backstabbers, it’s amazing how he functions at all.</description>

      <title>How Andy Cohen became ringmaster of our insane celebrity circus... </title>
      <link>https://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/How-Andy-Cohen-became-the-ringmaster-of-our-14473906.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.chron.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;NEW YORK - Andy Cohen bounced in his seat and pumped his fist. Diane von Furstenberg, one of his guests on his Bravo late-night show "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen," had just gone there - dished about her long-ago "brief love affair" with Richard Gere, not just on live TV but in the most deliciously, bluntly vulgar terms.  "Iconic! Iconic!" Cohen cheered, leaning over to give the fashion designer a high-five as his studio audience screamed.  Cohen, a reality-TV innovator behind the camera long before he became a talk-show host, has an uncanny radar for juicy details of famous and semifamous people's lives. That may be why his show has become a nightly raucous confessional for bona fide celebrities - even if they don't always plan on it.  The Gere story wasn't new news - von Furstenberg revealed it in her 2014 memoir - but it was new enough, or at least fun enough, to light up Cohen's audience that March night, as well as Page Six, People and dozens of other gossip-accumulating sites the next day. Yet it wasn't even the biggest scoop from that one 30-minute show. Cohen went to the phones to take questions from viewers. One asked his other guest, actress Julianne Moore, why she abandoned the leading role in "Can You Ever Forgive Me?" which turned into an Oscar nomination for Melissa McCarthy.  Moore, who had just set down a glass of white wine, winced. "I didn't leave that movie," she said, her voice light. "I was fired."  A gasp rose from the small audience. "Were you?!" Cohen exclaimed, then shifted into reporter mode: "Was there a reason? ... So you started shooting it? ... Did you see the movie?" She replied quietly: Creative differences. It happened during rehearsals. No, she hadn't yet seen the film. "It's still kind of painful."  Cohen, 51, who sharpened his interview skills at CBS News before deploying...</description>

      <title>Giuliani to make paid appearance at Kremlin-backed conference...</title>
      <link>https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Giuliani-scheduled-to-make-paid-appearance-at-14474063.php</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;www.ctpost.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;WASHINGTON - Rudy Giuliani, whose actions as President Donald Trump's personal lawyer have helped set in motion an impeachment inquiry, is set to appear as a paid speaker at a Kremlin-backed conference in Armenia on Tuesday - an event expected toinclude the participation of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials.  Giuliani confirmed to The Washington Post on Friday that he plans to take part in a panel at the conference sponsored by Russia and the Moscow-based Eurasian Economic Union, a trade alliance launched by Putin in 2014 as a counterweight to the European Union.  According to an agenda for the event posted online, Giuliani is set to participate in a panel led by Sergey Glazyev, a longtime Putin adviser who has been under U.S. sanctions since Russia's invasion of Ukraine five years ago.  Giuliani's decision to take part in the conference astounded national security experts. His scheduled appearance comes days after the release of a whistleblower complaint accusing Trump and Giuliani of pressuring Ukrainian officials for damaging information about Democrats.  Trump this summer withheld military aid from Ukraine, which counts on U.S. support to help fend off pro-Moscow separatists in the country's eastern provinces. As part of his efforts in Ukraine, Giuliani has said the focus on Russia's interference in the 2016 election has overlooked what he claims was meddling by Kiev.  The agenda for the Eurasian conference shows Giuliani is the only American scheduled to speak at the gathering.  In an interview Friday, Giuliani angrily rejected questions about whether it was appropriate for him to attend the event at which he also appeared last year.  "I will try to not knowingly talk to a Russian until this is all over," he retorted.  The former New York...</description>

In addition to Trump's call, a whistleblower complaint claimed that unidentified White House officials tried to keep the conversation a secret within the government.  "The consensus in our caucus is that our focus now is on this allegation," Pelosi told reporters earlier in the day, adding: "This is a coverup."  Pelosi and other leaders huddled in a basement conference room Thursday evening with more than a dozen "front-liner" members representing the toughest districts for incumbent Democrats to discuss the fledgling probe and, in the words of multiple attendees, "get on the same page."  Inside the room, the group urged the leadership to keep the messaging around impeachment on national security and the Ukraine probe being led by the House Intelligence Committee and Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. - not on the litany of potential Trump offenses being investigated by other panels, including the House Judiciary Committee, which traditionally takes the lead in impeachment proceedings.  "I'm very supportive of Adam Schiff and what...</description>
